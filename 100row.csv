0,"SAHIBZADA SANAULLAH, MEMBER, PROVINCIAL ASSEMBLY Versus GOVERNMENT OF KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA","June 13, 2017","PESHAWAR HIGH COURT"," Honorable Justice Waqar Ahmad Seth ","2017 PLD 186","JUDGMENT
 WAQAR AHMAD SETH, J.---
Sahibzada Sanaullah, Member Provincial Assembly, PK-93 Upper Dir, hereinafter called the petitioner, has invoked the writ jurisdiction of this Court under Article-199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 with the prayer to declare the discrimination in allocation of funds in the constituency of petitioner i.e. PK-93 in comparison to others as illegal, unconstitutional, void ab initio and direct the respondents to treat it at par / equal with others constituencies qua distribution of funds in all ADPs, in the interest of justice.
2.
 Facts, in brief relevant for the disposal of this writ petition are that, petitioner who is a returned candidate hailing from PK-93 Dir Upper, alleges that in General Election of 2013, one Behram Khan was declared as returned candidates and he remained as Member Provincial Assembly for sufficient time and being in alliance with the Government almost in all ADPs/developmental schemes/projects equal allocation of funds were granted/released to him/PK-93, which is evident from revised umbrella PC-1 ADP No. 732/150205 (2016-2017), however, after the decision of Election Tribunal as well as apex Court, when petitioner was declared as returned candidate, the existing projects/schemes standstill due to shortage of funds, besides other developmental schemes in all most all ADPs/other departments i.e. Irrigation and Communication of Works and Services Departments, funds have been distributed on discriminatory basis, depriving the locality/people of PK-93 from their due right as enshrined in Constitution by not treating them at par with other constituencies, hence the instant writ petition.
3.
 Comments were called from respondents which they furnished by negating the stance of petitioner and stated that umbrella PC-I for the scheme under ADP No.732 (2016-2017) ""Uplift of Rural Roads in Dir Upper and Dir Lower"" was originally approved at cost of Rs.500.00 million by PDWP forum. The cost of said ADP scheme has been enhanced through Chief Minister's Directive and consequently original cost increased to Rs.1050.00 million and revised PC-I was submitted by field office on need basis and get approval from PDWP forum. The subject scheme only covering two district i.e. Dir Upper and Dir Lower and the funds are allocated to the areas on need basis of the same districts and not constituency wise whereas no funds have been allocated out of the districts. There is no mechanism to allocate funds to members of Provincial Assembly, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The funds are allocated for the District on the recommendation of MPA, the constituency of the petitioner falls in Dir Upper and his District has been given 630 million against 1050 million.. That petitioner has not yet identified schemes under allocation of Rs.20.00 million. Furthermore, an amount of Rs.235.642 million has been allocated for developmental schemes of PK-93 in the last 40 years under ADP Nos. 730, 1316, 732 and RAHA programs, requested for dismissal of the writ petition.
4.
 We have heard learned counsel for the parties and available record gone through.
5.
 The facts which are not denying are that petitioner is the Member of Provincial Assembly from PK-93 Upper Dir, elected in the General Election 2013 and before the General Election 2013 the constituency of PK-93 was treated equally and in almost all the ADPs proper/equal allocation of funds were made to all the projects in the area and after that the funds allocated to the said constituency are much much less. Even in the district Dir, upper and lower which includes PK-91 to PK-97 the allocation of funds for PK-93 are 1/4th of the other allocation in other constituencies. For example at page-20 of the writ petition a breakup for the schemes ""uplift of rural roads in district Dir upper and lower, is a letter dated 20.12.2016, showing that PK-91 has been allocated 120 million, PK-92, 94, 95 and 96 are allocated 90 million each and PK-97 has been allocated 50 million while PK-93, are just with 20 million. Likewise in the first phase same was the position and in this respect documents attached at page-21 of the writ petition reflects the exact position. The obvious reasons mentioned by the petitioner that he belongs to opposition bench seems to be a correct allegation. Learned AAG along with representative of respondents failed to convince the Court that why is the such difference, even in the same district.
6.
 We have before us, the documents showing that petitioner time and again agitated the matter and finally vide letter dated 23.12.2016, Secretary Local Government was advised by the Worthy Chief Minister KPK to include in ADP scheme 732 to the constituency of PK-93, Upper Dir, but in spite of that nothing has been done as yet. The comparative statement placed on record clearly reflects that in the past, allocation of funds have been done discriminately, to the constituency of the petitioner in comparison to the members of ruling coalition partners. The allocation of funds to the Members of Provincial Assembly and their respective constituencies with different yardstick is not only discrimination of a particular member, but the public at large of a particular constituency have been deprived of their fundamental rights in all other departments as well.
7.
 This Court while deciding Writ Petition No. 4264-P of 2015, on 11.5.2016, while dealing with the royalty in reference to District Development Advisory Committee Act, 1989 and allocation of funds through the elected representatives has held as under:-
""There is no denial to the fact that royalty from the income of Oil and Gas discovered in the southern area is given to the concerned MPA for carrying of developmental project, in the district of Karak, Hangu and Kohat from the very inception. We have before us letter dated 25th August, 2015 issued from the Chief Minister Secretariat, addressed to Deputy Commissioner, Hangu, with the subject ""Identification of developmental schemes out of Oil and Gas Royalty, 2014-15"". The directions given by the Competent Authority are that funds amounting to rupees 108.00 million be released for developmental schemes proposed/identified by the concerned MNA. Likewise there is a letter dated 26th September, 2014 from the office of Chief Minister Secretariat addressed to Deputy Commissioner with the direction of the competent authority that request / demand of the president PTI for developmental schemes may be entertained out of Oil and Gas Royalty funds. Whereas the petitioner who is elected Member Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, PK-43, Hangu-2 has been deprived of his legitimate right to identify his schemes.
Record is suggestive that when these funds were not released/ allocated for the identification of schemes of the petitioner's, petitioner agitated the matter at the floor of the house and the matter was referred to the standing committee No.10, wherein the stance taken by the petitioner was acceded to, subsequently the said report of the standing committee No.10 on question No. 2375 of the petitioner was also presented in the Provincial Assembly. Record is further suggestive that the respondents gave the assurance but no practical steps were taken in this respect, therefore, a privilege motion was moved on 27.2.2015, which was referred to privilege committee and privilege No.59 was taken and it was unanimously agreed upon in the meeting of the committee and according to the directive of Chief Minister half of the fund of rupees 10 caroor and 80 lakhs was assured to be released forthwith and as such the privilege motion was delayed till the release of entire fund. Record suggests that there are number of correspondence in between petitioner, Speaker Provincial Assembly and Chief Minister, except release of rupees 108.560 million out of 10% during the financial year 2014-15 were released to Tehsil Tall PK-43.
Record is suggestive that more than 30 million rupees were approved and released by the Chief Minister to the president, Pakistan Tehreek Insaf, District Hangu, vide letter dated 17.11.2014 and rupees 108 million for the schemes identified by the MNA who also belongs to the ruling party. According to the law of land, the development funds are to be utilized through the elected representative of the constituency for provincial purposes and the MNA do not figure anywhere, what to say of office bearer/president of a ruling political party. If any funds as submitted by the petitioner, are released to the president Tehreek Insaf District Hangu, in the given circumstances amounts to a cognizable offence for the purpose of NAB Ordinance 1999 as well as Ehtesab Act, 2014.
Although petitioner has not called in question the guidelines for the release and utilization of funds from 10% Oil and Gas royalty and the formation/composition of District Development Committee at District level, however, it is observed that the same is not legally and properly constituted committee, because the public funds can only be utilized after observing legal formalities required and made mandatory under the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Establishment of District Development Advisory Committee Act, 1989, the relevant sections / clauses are as under:--
 
Clause (e) of section 2 defines the committee as:
""Committee means the District Development Advisory Committee of the District concerned, established under section 3.
 
Section 3 of the Act provides as;
3.(1) There shall be established, with immediate effect a committee to be known as the District Development Advisory Committee in each District, consisting of
(a)
 All the Members of the Provincial Assembly from the District concerned;
(b)
 Such other elected representative as the government may specify to be taken on the committee as co-opted members; and
(c)
 Such heads of Attached department at the district level as may be co-opted by the committee for their expert opinion.
(2)
 A co-opted member shall have no right of vote to exercise in any deliberation of the committee.
(3)
 The Chief Minister shall appoint one of the members to be the Chairman of the committee, who shall hold office during the pleasure of the Chief Minister.
(4)
 The committee shall take all decisions by consensus of opinion, but where such consensus is not achieved, the matter shall subject to the provision of subsection (2) be decided by majority of votes;
Provided that in case of equality of votes, the chairman shall have a second or casting vote;
Provided further that where a quota has been allocated to a Member in the development schemes of the province or the schemes approved are to be divided quota-wise, then there shall be no need for obtaining consensus of opinion regarding the allocation of projects or selection of sites, as the case may be, and it shall be the sole discretion of the member concerned to select sites or allocate projects, as the case may be, within his own quota.
(5)
 No act or proceedings of the committee shall be invalid by reason only of the existence of a vacancy in, or defect in the establishment of the Committee.
In view of above proceedings of the Provincial Assembly and assurance made and the discriminations so brought on record for the release of funds to another MPA from PK-42 of the same District, petitioner has made out a case of discrimination and victimization due to political differences and as such, this writ petition is allowed, as prayed for.
8.
 All the elected representatives have the equal right to the allocation of funds; especially the developmental funds and any deviation would be amounting to discrimination and against the fundamental and legal rights of the elected representatives and even the inhabitants of the constituency. In the comments so filed by respondent No.3 they have stated that there is no mechanism to allocate funds to Provincial Members, whereas in the comments of LG&RDD Department, it has been stated that umbrella PC-I of the scheme under ADP ""uplift of rural roads and Dir Upper and Dir Lower"" was originally approved at cost of Rs.500 million by PDWF forum and the said cost has been enhanced through Chief Minister directives by submitting revised PC-I, submitted by field offices on need basis and got approved from PDWF forum.
9.
 Admittedly, the subject scheme is umbrella in nature covering only two districts i.e District Upper and Lower and as such funds are allocated to the particular area on need basis of the same district. It has also been stated in the comments para-3 as under; moreover, the concerned MPA PK-93 has not yet identified schemes under allocation of Rs.20.00 million. Furthermore, an amount of Rs.235.642 million has been allocated for developmental schemes of PK-93 in the last 4 years."" Confirming that identification of the concerned MPA is the requirement and as such the plea of the petitioner that he was not asked for any identification rather the ongoing schemes are on the identification of ruling party office bearers and future contesting candidates seems to be correct. Even otherwise, the chart given in para-3 of the parawise comments, at page-2, clearly shows that in the constituencies PK-93 of petitioner and PK-97, which is also an opposition MPA, have been allocated less than hundred million while the constituencies i.e PK-91, 92, 94, 95, 96 are all having more than 150 million, clearly demonstrating the favoritism and nepotism. It is the bounden duty of the Government/public functionaries to function in good faith, honestly and within the parameter of its power so that person concerned should be treated in accordance with law as guaranteed by Article 4, of the constitution, which includes principles of natural justice, procedure fairness and procedure proprietary and any action, which was mala fide or colorable could not be regarded as action in accordance with law. In the case of Pir Imran Sajid and others v. Managing Director/General Manager (Manager Finance) Telephone Industries of Pakistan reported in 2015 SCMR 1257 (d), (e) & (f) it has been held as under:--
----Art. 4 & Preamble---Socio-economic justice---Scope---Whole edifice of governance of the society had its genesis in the constitution and laws aimed at to establish an order, inter alia, ensuring the provisions of socio-economic justice, so that the people may have guarantee and sense of being treated in accordance with law, and that they were not being deprived of their due rights.
----Art. 4 and Public functionaries, duty of---Natural justice---Procedural fairness and propriety---Every public functionary was supposed to function in good faith, honestly and within the precincts of its power so that person concerned should be treated in accordance with law as guaranteed by Art. 4 of the Constitution, which included principles of natural justice, procedural fairness and procedural propriety--Any action which was mala fide or colourable was not regarded as action in accordance with law.
----Arts.4 & 25-Administration authorities, duty of--Good governance---Scope of good governance could not be achieved by exercising discretionary powers unreasonably or arbitrarily and without application of mind---Such objective could be achieved by following the rules of justness, fairness and openness in consonance with the command of the Constitution enshrined in different articles including Arts. 4 & 25 of the Constitution---Obligation to act fairly on the part of the administrative authority had been evolved to ensure the rule of law and to prevent failure of the justice.

 In view of the above this writ petition is allowed, as prayed for.

 LAL JAN KHATTAK, J.---
Petitioner Rehmanullah seeks his post arrest bail in case FIR No.44 dated 26.01.2017 under sections 18(b) and 22(b) of the Emigration Ordinance, 1979 of Police Station FIA, AHTC, Peshawar, wherein, he is charged for taking money from the complainant in order to send him abroad.
2.
 Arguments heard and record gone through.
3.
 A cursory look at the case record would show that in the FIR no specific date has been mentioned on which the complainant had given money to the petitioner for sending him abroad, which aspect of the case cannot be overlooked while deciding this bail petition. Furthermore, both the offences for which the petitioner stands charged are punishable with imprisonment for 14 years or with fine or with both. It is well settled that when a Statute provides two punishments simultaneously for commission of an offence, then for the purpose of bail the lesser punishment is considered by the court and there is reason for that as in case the prosecution succeeds in proving its case against the accused, then whether the court will inflict him the maximum or the minimum sentence, which aspect of the case has brought the petitioner's case within the ambit of further inquiry as there is no certainty that he will be awarded the term of imprisonment. Moreso, investigation in the case is complete and the petitioner is no more required for further investigation. Apart from the above learned counsel for the petitioner relied on case law reported as 2006 MLD 1062, 2012 YLR 1106/2511, 2014 PCr.LJ 297, 2016 YLR 355 and 2016 PCr.LJ 1238, wherein, the accused similarly charged were granted bail.
4.
 Tentative assessment of the case record would reveal that involvement of the petitioner qua his guilt in the crime needs further inquiry in terms of subsection (2) of section 497, Cr.P.C., therefore, he is entitled to the concession of bail.
5.
 For what has been discussed above, this petition is allowed and the petitioner is granted bail subject to his furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs.100,000/- with two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of learned trial court, which shall ensure that the sureties are local, reliable and men of means.

 ZAHEER-UD-DIN KAKAR, J.---
 The petitioners through this petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973 assails the validity of order dated 24.4.2017 ""the impugned order"", passed by the Special Judge, Anti-Terrorism Court-II, Quetta ""the trial Court"", whereby an application for transfer of the case was dismissed.
2.
 Precisely stated, the facts of the case are that on 17.9.2016 at about 5:15 p.m, the complainant Captain Adnan Ishaq of 74 Wing, Chiltan Rifles, lodged FIR No.264 of 2016, under Sections 337-AD, 353, 392, 511, 186, 147, 148, 149, P.P.C. read with section 7 ATA with Satellite Town Police Station, Quetta against the petitioners with the allegations that on the fateful day, he (complainant) along with other FC personnel were checking the vehicles. Meanwhile, one Land Cruiser bearing registration No.LEF-20 having black glasses, wherein three armed gunmen were present, came from western side, which was stopped and on query a permit was showed which was not acceptable. Then a person, whose name was later on known as Haji Sadiq, said that no one could stop him, thus, a quarrel took place which resulted in causing injury to sepoy Mureed Abbas and they also attempted to snatch the official weapon from sepoy Akmal. The FC personnel overpowered the petitioners and recovered different types of weapon and rounds, detail mentioned in FIR.
3.
 After completion of investigation. challan of the case was submitted before the trial Court. During pendency of the case, an application under section 23 of the ATA, 1997 was moved on behalf of the accused (petitioners). The trial Court, through order dated 26.4.2017 rejected the application, hence this petition.
4.
 Learned counsel for the petitioners contended that the impugned order passed by the trial Court is against the law; that the trial Court has mis-appreciated the facts of the case; that the provisions of section 6 of ATA, 1997 not attracted in this case; that the offences mentioned in the FIR have no nexus with the definition of section 6 of the Act. Finally, he prayed for setting aside the impugned order and transfer of the case to the ordinary Court.
5.
 We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and has gone through the available record. In order to determine as to whether an offence would fall within the ambit of section 6 of Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, it is essential to have a glance over the allegations made in the FIR, material collected during investigation and surrounding circumstances. It is also necessary to examine whether the ingredients of alleged offence have any nexus with the object of the case as contemplated under sections 6, 7 and 8 thereof. Whether a particular act is an act of terrorism or not, the motivation, object design and purpose behind the said act is to be seen. It is also to be seen as to whether the said act has created a sense of fear and insecurity in the public or in a section of the public or community or in any sect and, whether the action results in striking terror or creating fear, panic, sensation, helplessness and sense of insecurity among the people in the particular area it amounts to terror and such an action squarely falls within the ambit of section 6 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 and shall be triable by a Special Court constituted for such purpose.
6.
 Section 6 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 provides the definition of ""terrorism"". In order to better appreciate the legal position. Section 6(b) of the said Act which defines a ""terrorist act"" is reproduced as under:
""6.
 Terrorism
.---(1) In this Act, ""terrorism"" means the use or threat of action where
(a)
(b)
 The use or threat is designed to coerce and intimidate or overawe the Government or the public or a section of the public or community or sect or create a sense of fear or insecurity in society.""
7.
 A bare reading of the above quoted provision of law makes it crystal clear that Courts have only to see whether the ""terrorist act"" was such which would have the tendency to create sense of fear and insecurity in the minds of the people or any section of the society. The honourable Supreme Court in a case reported as The State through Advocate General, N.W.F.P. Peshawar v. Muhammad Shafiq PLD 2003 SC 224 has held as under:--
""We have to see the psychological impact created upon the minds of the people. It is also not necessary that the said act must have taken place within the view of general public so as to bring it within the encompass of the Act. Even an act having taken place in a barbaric and gruesome manner, if it had created fear and insecurity, would certainly come within the purview of the act.""
8.
 In the present case, the petitioners have committed offence on the main road, target was Frontier Corps officers and officials and during scuffle with the FC officials, sepoy Mureed Abbas sustained injuries and they (petitioners) also tried to snatch official weapons from FC personnel. They were overpowered and the FC personnel recovered different types of weapons and rounds from their possession. The act of the petitioners on main road created fear and insecurity to the general public. Moreover, act of the petitioners apparently involves serious violence against the members of the law enforcement agency (F.C.) as such, case prima facie falls under section 6(m) and (n) of Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, therefore, Anti-Terrorism Court has the exclusive jurisdiction to try the case, as such, we do not find merit in this petition and the same is dismissed in limine.

3,"NOOR MUHAMMAD Versus SAJJAD AKHTAR","June 12, 2017","QUETTA HIGH COURT BALOCHISTAN"," Honorable Justice Abdullah Baloch ","2017 PLD 96","JUDGMENT
 ABDULLAH BALOCH, J.---
This judgment disposes of C.P. No.96 of 2016 filed by petitioner Noor Muhammad S/o Gul Muhammad caste Baloch, resident of Turbat, against the respondents with the averments that the petitioner is allotee of plots Nos.330 and 351 in Satellite Town Turbat and the said property was allotted to him on 9th May 1996 and the petitioner has regularly deposited the installments of the said plots besides by making huge expenses on construction of a boundary wall over the plots and also having the peaceful possession of the aforesaid plots.
2.
 It is further averred from the petition of the petitioner that the respondent No.1 Sajjad Akhtar S/o Muhammad Usman filed an application (complaint) before the respondent No.4 Provincial Ombudsman (Mohtasib Balochistan) in the year 2011 wherein stated that the plot Nos. B-330 and B-351 of Satellite Town Turbat were allotted to Haji Noor Muhammad and Ghulam Sarwar respectively by the then Chairman Municipal Committee Turbat and it was alleged in the said application that the petitioner being an irrelevant person occupied these plots illegally and unlawfully, had constructed a four wall without issuing NOC in his favour for construction. It is further submitted by the petitioner that on such application of respondent No.1 the learned Ombudsman Balochsitan (respondent No.4) without issuing notice to the petitioner and without investigating the matter directed the official respondent No.2 vide its findings/decision dated 9th Apri1 2013, relevant portion whereof reproduced as under:-
Keeping in view the above there is no need of further investigation. The higher authorities of Local Government Department needs to take action against officers not fulfilling their duties properly and plots in satellite town Turbat are being occupied/encroached by irrelevant persons, be vacated and entrusted to their lawful owners. The case is closed and parties are informed accordingly.
3.
 The learned counsel for the petitioner contended that on the directions of learned Ombudsman Balochistan, the official respondents have started illegal interference in the peaceful possession of the petitioner. He further contended that even otherwise, the matter pertains to factual controversy and is a civil dispute in nature, which could not be resolved or entertained by the Ombudsman, as such, the order passed by the learned Ombudsman is without jurisdiction, void ab initio, not sustainable and liable to be set aside.
4.
 The petition was contested by the respondents Nos.1,2 and 3 wherein categorically denied the claim of the petition, Mr. Jadain Dashti, learned counsel for the respondent No.1 while arguing the case stated that basically the plots in question were allotted to Haji Noor Muhammad S/o Gul Muhammad and Ghulam Sarwar S/o Muhammad Usman by the then Chairman, Municipal Committee Turbat, which was later on occupied by the petitioner as a result whereof the respondent No.1 filed a complaint on behalf of Haji Noor Muhammad and Ghulam Sarwar allottees before the learned Ombudsman Balochistan and after proper investigation and calling of record from the concerned quarters, the learned Ombudsman passed directions to the concerned authorities to get vacate the plots from the petitioner/occupant. He further contended that against the order of Ombudsman appeal is provided, as such, Constitution Petition is not maintainable.
5.
 Mr. Saleem Baloch, learned Additional Advocate General while arguing the matter on behalf of respondents Nos.2 and 3 submitted that the respondent No.2 i,e. Municipal Committee Turbat in his Para-wise comments declared the allotments of the petitioner as fake one, while verified the allotment orders of the Haji Noor Muhammad and Ghulam Sarwar as genuine, who were represented by the respondent No.1. He further contended that against the order of Ombudsman, Constitution Petition is incompetent and the petition so filed by the petitioner is liable to be dismissed.
6.
 We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record, the moot question arised between the parties is that whether the learned Ombudsman having jurisdiction to decide the civil dispute. The learned counsel for the petitioner mainly agitated the point of jurisdiction that the Ombudsman having no jurisdiction to decide civil disputes pertaining to factual controversies while on the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent No.1 and the learned AAG raised objection on the maintainability of the petition on the ground that the order so passed by the Ombudsman within the purview of the Ordinance of 2001 could not be assailed in constitutional jurisdiction while appeal is provided under section 32 of the Ordinance of 2001 to be filed with the worthy Governor of Balochistan.
7.
 After thorough analysis of the arguments put forth before us we are of the firm opinion that so far as the contention of respondent regarding Section 29 of Ordinance of 2001 is concerned, the such provisions contained in Section 29 of Ordinance of 2001 would only apply, if the Ombudsman order is within the four corners of the law defining its jurisdiction, if there is any lack of jurisdiction, the provisions contained in Article 199 of Constitution would be attracted. It is by now settled by the Superior Courts that, where the order passed by the Ombudsman, on the face of it is repugnant to law, under which it was made or suffers from want of jurisdiction, this Court may invoke its inherent jurisdiction vested in it under the law so as to prevent injustice being done to an aggrieved person. The jurisdiction of the Ombudsman is restricted by Section 9 (1) of the Ordinance of 2001 and cannot be extended further.
8.
 It is also shocking to note that the Ombudsman while accepting the complaint of respondent No.1 without issuing notice to the petitioner. The order passed by the learned Ombudsman, without affording an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner, cannot be blessed with blanket of authenticity, being violative of universally acknowledged principle of ""Audi Alteram Partem"", which has gained much importance after insertion of Article 10-A of the Constitution. In this respect, reliance is placed to the case of ""Pakistan Cromines Limited v. The Inquiry Officer, WarRisk Insurance (Sindh Balochistan Ministry of Commerce) (1983 SCMR 1208"").
9
 It is settled principle of law that the judgment of honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan is binding on each and every organ of state by virtue of Articles 189 and 190 of the Constitution. It is also settled by now that when the basic order is without lawful authority, then the superstructure shall have to fall on the ground automatically.
10.
 Now coming to the last limb of argument advanced by the learned A A.G and counsel for the private of respondent that in presence of alternate remedy against the order passed by the Ombudsman by way of appeal under section 32 of the Ordinance of 2001, this petition is not maintainable. We are of the considered view though ordinarily, when alternate remedy is available, the constitution petition is not maintainable, but in the cases, where the order impugned is patently illegal and without jurisdiction, the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court cannot be abridged on account of availability of alternate remedy, rather this Court, being custodian of fundamental rights of the citizens of the country, is under obligation to take care of the orders passed by the executives and Quasi judicial forums, when the same are brought before it in the constitution petition. In this regard, reference can be made to the cases of ""Muslim Abad Cooperative Housing Society Limited v. M/s Siddiqa Faiz ( PLD 2008 Supreme Court 135) and M/s Ahmed Clinic v. Government of Sindh 2003 CLC 1196, it was held by the Honorable Supreme Court that the High Court will not entertain a writ petition when other appropriate remedy is available is not a rule of law barring jurisdiction, but a rule by which the Court regulates it jurisdiction. When statutory functionary with mala fide or in impartial, unjust and oppressive manner, the High Court in exercise of its writ jurisdiction has power to grant relief to the aggrieved party.
11.
 Although the Court exercising writ jurisdiction cannot claim in the exercise of constitutional power to usurp the functions of the authority on which the power had been vested, but the Court exercising writ jurisdiction can insist for being satisfied that the action taken is not mere a colorable power. Even otherwise, as already observed hereinabove, neither the petitioner arrayed as party by the respondent No.1 in his application/complaint, nor did the Ombudsman bother to give notice to him to join the proceedings, prior to passing the impugned order.
12.
 In view of the above discussion, we accept this Constitution petition and declare that impugned order passed by the Ombudsman to have been without lawful authority, void ab initio and of no legal effect as such, the matter pertaining to a civil dispute and the parties are left at liberty to invoke the Court of competent jurisdiction for redressal of their grievances. No order as to costs.

 JAWAD HASSAN, J.---
Through this appeal, the Appellants have called in question the order rendered in W.P. No.31061/2014 dated 22.01.2015 passed by the learned Single Judge (the ""Impugned Order""), whereby the constitutional petition of the Respondent was allowed.
2.
 Brief facts for the disposal of instant appeal are that earlier the Respondent filed W.P. No.22214/2011 for provision of electricity connection to his premises which was remitted to the Appellants vide order dated 13.09.2012 with a direction to look into the grievance of the Respondent. The Appellants refused the request of the Respondent vide order dated 25.03.2013 for the reason that his residence is situated in Housing Scheme Gulshan-e-Azeem Sialkot. Feeling aggrieved by the said order the Respondent filed W.P. No.31061/2014 which was allowed vide the impugned order. Hence, this Appeal.
3.
 Learned counsel for the Appellants submitted that the impugned order is against law and facts as the same has been passed by ignoring the fact that providing the electricity connection to the Respondent whose resident is situated at Link Burj Road, Mian Sialkot Daska Road (the ""Property"") i.e. within the Housing Society, is totally against the policy of GEPCO Limited unless the entire Housing Society is not electrified; that the running of 11KV system close to the Housing Society is not ground for providing electricity to an individual.
4.
 On the other hand learned counsel for the Respondent submitted that the writ petition has rightly been allowed as there is no illegality in the impugned order. Learned counsel also contended that to enjoy the facility of electricity is right to every citizen of Pakistan including the Respondent and that too when the same has been provided to the other persons of the locality; that he has been provided the connection by the SNGPL of the gas supply; that no one can be deprived from his/her fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the ""Constitution""), as such the instant Appeal is liable to be dismissed.
5.
 We have heard the arguments of the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the record.
6.
 From the perusal of record it reveals that the Respondent has appended with the writ petition copy of application dated 01.08.2011 for Domestic Three Phase Connection, in which he specifically mentioned that his house is not situated in any Housing Society; that a number of electricity connections have already been provided to many of the inhabitants of the locality; that he has been provided connection of sui gas; that he is ready to bear all the expenditures that may occur. The Respondent has also appended along with the petition copy of NOC issued by the Tehsil Municipal Administration showing no objection on provision of electricity connection to the Respondent as the residential building plan has been approved by the TMA. The perusal of record further depicts that in the application dated 21.05.2014 given to the Chief Executive Officer, GEPCO the Respondent has mentioned that he has purchased the land from Zarqa Qayyum, a private owner of the land and that the sponsors of the alleged colony could never get preliminary NOC from the TMA Sialkot during the last ten (10) years nor they are interested to make a housing scheme. Record further reveals that the said Colony is under objection which has not been removed so far.
7.
 From the above, it is crystal clear that the residential building plan of the Respondent has been approved by the TMA and they have no objection on provision of electricity connection. It is noticeable here that the TMA vide letter dated 09.05.2014 has stated that the residential building plan of the Respondent has been approved but vide letter dated 08.11.2014, showing the status of the said Gulshan Azeem Colony Daska Road, Sialkot, has stated that the approval of the Society is pending due to objections duly conveyed to applicants on 08.08.2009 but the applicants have not cleared the objections hence the layout plan is unapproved yet. The status of pendency is also conveyed to Government for information. From the above, it is explicit that the approval of the society has not been given by the TMA. In the report and parawise comments the Appellants have mentioned that it has passed the order in terms of its Policy of the Department, whereby in a housing society, if the electrification is not connected by the sponsors, the electric connection cannot be sanctioned in favour of the individual consumer. It means that it is the Policy of the Respondents-Department that without electrification in a housing society, no individual is allowed to have an electricity connection, separately. But in the present case the situation is different, as admittedly, the alleged housing society has not yet been approved/registered by the Authority, as such does not have the status of a 'Housing Society'. The Respondent has also produced letter dated 22.04.2015, issued by the Tehsil Municipal Administra-tion, Sialkot, through which the Respondent has been intimated that the plan of subject colony submitted by Ch. Azeem Safdar and others in TMA Sialkot has been rejected by this office, therefore, the Respondent cannot be refused supplying electricity connection because there exists no housing society and the said policy cannot have its effect upon the case of the Appellant.
8.
 The order dated 13.04.2017 passed by this Court in the instant Appeal reveals that in compliance of this Court's order the demand notice dated 12.04.2017 amounting to Rs.2,40,500/- has been delivered to the Appellants/Department in the Court, therefore, now the Respondent cannot be denied from issuance of electricity connection as a substantial right has been accrued in his favour. Undeniably, the Respondent is the citizen of this country and the Constitution guarantees fundamental rights to every citizen. This Court is meant to protect and enforcement of the fundamental rights of the citizens which are being infringed by anyone. To enjoy the facility of electricity is fundamental right of the all the citizens under the Constitution and particularly, in the present era when life seems to be impossible without electricity. The Respondent has given application for Domestic Three Phase Connection for his house which is admittedly his fundamental right, as such the learned Single Judge has rightly observed in the impugned order that to provide electricity to the Respondent is his fundamental right which cannot be denied in any manner and has also placed reliance on the case titled Mehar Muhammad Nawaz, Ex-OG-I, Small Business Finance Corporation Multan v. Managing Director, Small Business Finance Corporation and 2 others 2009 SCMR 187.
9.
 We fully agree with the finding of the learned single Judge who allowed the petition directing the appellants to provide electricity connection to the Respondent's premises as it is his fundamental right. In view of above circumstances, we see no illegality or jurisdictional error in the impugned order which has been passed in line with the dictates of law and does not warrant any interference by this Division Bench.
10.
 Resultantly, the instant Appeal is devoid of any merit and is accordingly dismissed.

 ADNAN-UL-KARIM MEMON, J.---
The Applicants namely Abdul Hameed Shaikh and Danish Gul Chandio are seeking Post Arrest Bail in a case Crime No.41/2017, under section 285, 286, P.P.C. and Section 3/4 Prohibition (Enforcement of Had) Order 1979, registered at Police Station Taluka, District Larkana. Applicants moved bail application twice in above crime before learned Judicial Magistrate-Ill, Larkana and the same were dismissed vide order dated 15.4.2017 and 28.4.2017 respectively. Thereafter, Applicants moved bail applications twice before learned Sessions Judge, Larkana which were also dismissed vide order dated 19.4.2017 and 20.5.2017 respectively.
2.
 The gist of allegations against the Applicants according to the FIR is that on 12.04.2017 ASI Abdul Sattar Khatyan of Police Station Taluka, Larkana alongwith subordinate staff i.e. PC-Oshaq Ahmed and PC-Hakim Ali were on patrol duty. During patrolling, when they reached Indus Highway Larkana, they received spy information about one Blue Car carrying certain objectionable material. Upon seeing the said car, they signaled to stop, search was conducted and found one person sitting on the rear seat of car with packets of explosives comprising of 1400 boxes in 4 sacks and three cartons containing 60(20 bottles in each carton) tin bottles of beer/alcohol respectively. The aforesaid recovered items were sealed and secured under Mushirnama. On inquiry, the driver of car disclosed his name as Abdul Hameed son of Akbar Ali Shaikh, resident of Shaikh Muhalla, Kamber. The person who was sitting on rear seat of car disclosed his name as Danish Gul son of Ali Gul Chandio, resident of Kamber Ali Khan. Accused persons and recovered property were brought at Police Station and FIR was lodged under Section 285,286 of PPC and Section 3/4 Prohibition (Enforcement of Had) Order, 1979 on behalf of the State.
3.
 Investigating Officer of the case prepared Mushirnama of place of incident, recorded statements of prosecution witnesses, interrogated the Applicants, got conducted chemical examination of recovered alcohol, obtained its report and submitted Charge Sheet against the Applicants on 20.04.2017.
4.
 Learned counsel for the Applicants argued that Applicants have falsely been implicated in the subject crime by the police with mala fide intention by concocting a story due to enmity. It is further asserted that Applicants are students who have no criminal record. They further added that nothing was recovered from the possession of Applicants and the /alleged recovery is foisted upon them. They next contended that there is /a violation of section 103 Cr.P.C. as no private person has been cited as witness from the Area where the alleged recovery was made despite the fact that place of incident is a very thickly populated area. Therefore, the case requires further inquiry to ascertain the guilt of the Applicants. They further argued that offences are not punishable with death or imprisonment for life. They next contended that section 3 Prohibition (Enforcement of Hadd) Order,1979 is not applicable in the present case, section 4 of Prohibition of (Enforcement of Hadd) Order,1979 is punishable up to two years and offences under Section 285 and 286 PPC are bailable, therefore Applicants are entitled for the concession of Bail as matter of right. The learned counsel for the Applicants in support of their contentions has placed reliance upon the case of Shah Nawaz and others v. The State (2008 SCMR 1436), Muhammad Ummer v. The State (PLD 2004 SC 477), Saeed Ahmed v. The State (1996 SCMR 1132), Munawar Hussain Talat v. The State (2005 YLR 1215)and Muhammad Siddiq v. The State (1988 PCr.LJ 947).Per learned counsel in the light of the aforesaid case law the punishment provided for the alleged offences is less than three years, which becomes bailable. Therefore, the case of Applicants does not fall within the prohibitory clause of section 497(1) of Cr.P.C. Learned counsel further asserted that alleged recovered case property i.e. tin bottles of beer/alcohol were sent for chemical analysis after considerable delay of five days without any plausible explanation. Therefore, the Chemical Examination Report has lost the presumption of authenticity and cannot be considered at bail stage.
5.
 Learned Addl. Prosecutor General for the State has opposed the grant of bail and argued that Applicants were arrested at the spot while transporting 1400 boxes of explosives packed in 4 sacks and three cartons containing 20 each tin bottles of ::,eer/ alcohol. He next argued that Chemical Examination Report and statements of witnesses fully supported the prosecution case. He next contended that Applicants have been charged with offences punishable under Section 3/4 Prohibition (Enforcement of Hadd) Order, 1979 read with sections 285 and 286, P.P.C. which are of serious nature. He next argued that Applicants are charged with allegations of transport and possession of explosive material and 60 tin bottles of beer/Alcohol containing 6.5 % V/V Ethyl Alcohol in huge quantity. He next contended that Prosecution has collected sufficient incriminating evidence against the Applicants and if the bail is granted the Applicants will continue to commit similar criminal activities causing harm to the public at large. Therefore, the Applicants are not entitled to the concession of bail. In support of his contentions he relied upon the case of IMTIAZ AHMED and others v. THE STATE (PLD 1997 SC 545). He further added that learned Trial Court rejected bail applications of the Applicants twice on merits vide order dated 15.4.2017 and 28.4.2017 respectively, as well as learned Sessions Court, Larkana vide respective orders dated 19.4.2017 and 20.5.2017.
6.
 I have heard learned counsel for the Applicants and learned Addl. P.G. for the State, perused the material available on record and case law cited at the Bar.
7.
 I am conscious of the fact that while deciding a bail application, 1 this Court has to consider the allegations made in the FIR, statements /recorded under section 161, Cr.P.C., nature and gravity of charge, other incriminating material against the accused, legal pleas raised by the accused and the relevant law.
8.
 Record reflects that Applicants have been arrested red-handed with 1400 boxes of explosive material packed in total 4 sacks and sixty tin bottles of beer/Alcohol. Per Chemical Examination Report, the aforesaid material/parcel contains 6.5% V/V as Ethyl Alcohol. The recovery of above specified explosive substance and alcohol was duly witnessed by police officials. The perusal of record does not reflect any ostensible reason on the part of police which could indicate false implication of the Applicants. Therefore, police official are as good witnesses as any other person.
9.
 Insofar as the plea taken by the learned counsel for the Applicants with respect to non-association of private witnesses is concerned, the complainant has explained the same in the FIR that incident took place at odd hours of the night. And, plea of enmity is a factual controversy which cannot be looked into at bail stage, as deeper appreciation of I; evidence is not required to be considered at bail stage because only tentative assessment of the record is to be made.
10.
 Prima facie the offence falls under Section 3 and 4 Prohibition;. (Enforcement of Hadd) Order, 1979 read with section 285 and 286, P.P.C. and section 3 is punishable up to five years imprisonment, which are of serious nature. Apparently, sufficient incriminating material has been collected by the police against the Applicants.
11.
 It is well settled principle of law that an offence which does not fall/within the prohibitory clause of section 497(1), Cr.P.C. does not become a bailable offence automatically. Therefore, if the circumstances warrant bail can be refused even in respect of offences not falling under the prohibitory clause of section 497(1), Cr.P.C.
12.
 The case law cited by the learned counsel for the Applicants are distinguishable from the facts and circumstances of the present case.
13.
 In view of the above, I am of the opinion that Applicants have failed to make out a case for grant of bail at this stage. Accordingly, the instant bail application is dismissed.
14.
 The findings mentioned above are tentative in nature which shall not prejudice the case of either party at the trial stage. However, the learned Trial Court is directed to record evidence of the material witnesses within a period of two months where after the Applicants will be at liberty to move fresh bail application before the learned Trial Court on fresh ground, if they so desire.
15.
 Above are the reasons of short order dated 06.6.2017.

6,"ZAHID HUSSAIN Versus State","June 12, 2017","PESHAWAR HIGH COURT"," Honorable Justice Abdul Shakoor ","2018 YLRN 147","ORDER
 ABDUL SHAKOOR, J.---
Petitioner, Zahid Hussain, seeks his release on bail in case FIR No.362 dated 14.05.2017 under sections 15-AA/5 Explosive registered at Police Station, Daudzai, Peshawar.
2.
 The brief facts of the case are that on 14.05.2017 at 2030 hours, the complainant, Syed Sardar Ali Shah, SHO Police Station Daudzai was on combining operation in the, area, he also conducted raid at the house of one Ijaz son of Mir Ahmad Shah, who is a proclaimed offender in case FIR No.69 dated 27.1.2017 registered under sections 302/ 324/34, P.P.C. of Police Station, Daudzai, Peshawar was wanted by the police, but the said P.O. was not found at his house, however, the police party found the present accused/ petitioner in the house of said P.O. The personal search of the accused/petitioner led to the recovery of a 9 MM Pistol bearing No.013008-10-CN-236 loaded along with 26 live rounds of the same bore and 03 hand grenades. The accused/ petitioner could not produce any valid license or permit for carrying the said deadly weapons and explosives, hence the FIR.
3.
 The learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the accused/ petitioner is innocent and has falsely been implicated in the case with ulterior motive by the police; Further contended that under Section 7 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908 permission of the Provincial Government must be obtained but in the instant case no permission has yet been obtained. Further submitted that there is no mentioned serial numbers with regard to hand grenades; that there is no independent evidence against the accused/petitioner on the file as required under section 103, Cr.P.C.; Learned counsel for petitioner further argued that the accused/petitioner is first offender and never involved previously in such like cases; and that the charge levelled against the accused/petitioner requires further probe into his guilt and as such, he is entitled to the concession of bail. Learned counsel for the petitioner placed reliance on case titled Shah Zaman v. The State (2012 MLD 410), Habib-ur-Rehman v. The State (2012 YLR 665), Zain-ul-Abidin v. The State (2010 MLD 173) and Karamat Khan v. The State (2011 YLR 1390).
4.
 On the other hand, the learned AAG on behalf of State opposed the arguments of learned counsel for the petitioner and contended that the accused/ petitioner is directly charged in the FIR and recovery has been effected from his personal possession. Further contended that the offence, with which the petitioner is charged heinous in nature and also falls within the prohibitory clause of section 497, Cr.P.C. In these circumstances, the accused/petitioner is not entitled to the concession of bail.
5.
 I have heard learned counsel for the petitioner, learned AAG on behalf of State and perused the available record with their assistance.
6.
 Perusal of record would show that no permission/sanction from the Provincial Government/ competent authority is available on record, as required under Section 7 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908, for holding a trial in the case of accused/petitioner, which is mandatory. The record would further reveal that no public witness of the locality as required under section 103, Cr.P.C. was associated with the recovery proceedings. The Expert report is also not available on record to ascertain as to whether the recovered arms and ammunition were in working condition or not. The recovery of three hand grenades from one side pocket is also intolerable/impossible and also no serial number has been mentioned of the said hand grenades and thus case of the accused/petitioner is made out that of further inquiry. Besides, the petitioner is behind the bars since his arrest and there is no prospect of conclusion of his trial in the near future.
7.
 For the reasons discussed above, the instant bail application is allowed and the accused/petitioner is admitted to bail subject to furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs.2,00,000/- with two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate. The sureties must be reliable and men of means.
8.
 Above are the reasons of my short order of even date.

 M. TABASSUM AFTAB ALVI, C.J.---
The supra titled writ petition has been addressed under Section 44 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act, 1974 whereby vires of the impugned notification dated 05th April, 2017, through which license of Advocacy of petitioner was cancelled by the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Bar Council, on the basis of stricture made by the apex Court through its order dated 21st March, 2017, has been challenged for having been issued as without lawful authority.
2.
 Precise facts culminating into filing of the instant writ petition are that petitioner was enrolled as an Advocate of the High Court on 14th September, 1981. After completing prescribed period of practice, he was enrolled as an Advocate of the Supreme Court on 23rd July, 1983. The apex Court previously referred the matter of misconduct of petitioner to the Bar Council under Section 38 by suspending his legal practice while exercising powers under Section 51 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Bar Council Act, 1995, through judgment dated 11th May, 2010. However, as Disciplinary Committee could not dispose off complaint within a period of 03 months, therefore, order of suspension pertaining to legal practice of petitioner was declared as vacated by afflux of time, by the apex Court through order dated 2nd May, 2011. The petitioner moved an application before the Supreme Court, in Review Petition No.2/2016, titled ""Mujahid Hussain Naqvi v. Azad Govt. and others"" for adjournment on the ground of ailment, stating therein, that his brain activity reduced to 75%, however, certain observations were passed against him by the apex Court through order dated 21st March, 2017. The matter was, however, referred to Bar Council and consequently on the basis of observations made by the Supreme Court, license of petitioner was abrogated by the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Bar Council, through the impugned notification dated 05th April, 2017. Against the aforesaid impugned notification petitioner previously filed Writ Petition No.721/2017 and impleaded parties to Hon'ble Senior Judge of the Supreme Court, as well as Registrar of the Supreme Court, as respondents Nos.6 and 7, in the said writ petition. The single Bench of this Court solicited comments with show cause from all respondents through order dated 26th April, 2017, however later on, when the aforesaid fact came in the notice of the Bench seized with the matter that Hon'ble Judge of the Supreme Court was also impleaded party by name, the said writ petition was returned in original to petitioner vide order dated 27th April, 2017, hence, the instant subsequent writ petition.
3.
 The petitioner himself argued case and submitted that Azad Jammu and Kashmir Bar Council, issued the impugned notification dated 05th April, 2017, whereby his license of advocacy was unlawfully abrogated on the basis of order of the Supreme Court without providing him an opportunity of hearing. He contended that through order dated 21st March, 2017, the apex Court only referred the matter to Bar Council for detailed report, however, the Bar Council, cancelled his license in colorable exercise of powers in hasty manner, hence, submitted for admission of writ petition.
4.
 We have perused the contents of writ petition and examined the appended documents as well as service record of petitioner made available with utmost care.
5.
 A perusal of record reveals that Hon'ble Senior Puisne Judge, of the apex Court passed following stricture against petitioner through order dated 21st March, 2017:-
3. Mr. Mujahid Hussain Naqvi, advocate, petitioner, has moved an application for seeking adjournment on the ground of ailment. The relevant contents of the application read as under:-
""That the petitioner who is a known patient of 'reactive depression' owing to having remained constantly in stress-oriented atmosphere since 6th March, 2017 has undergone a recurrent attack of the ailment. And has been constrained to restart heavy intoxicating drugs, which keep his brain drowsy and half asleep. Resultantly his brain activity goes reduced to 75%. He is thus not in a befitting position to appear before the Hon'ble Court and participate in proceedings sharply and with full effectiveness.""
After going through the contents of the application, Mr. Raza Ali Khan, the learned Advocate-General, who is also the Chairman of AJ&K Bar Council, was called to the rostrum to apprise the Court, who stated that according to his information, Mr. Mujahid Hussain Naqvi is not holding valid license of the AJ&K Bar Council. After such statement by the Chairman Bar Council, the position has become more aggravate, which requires thorough probe in the light of the provisions of Legal Practitioners and Bar Council Act, 1995. I would also like to observe here that in a number of cases, Mr. Mujahid Hussain Naqvi, Advocate, has moved such like applications. Yesterday, in a case titled Mujahid Hussain Naqvi v. Ansr Mehmood Awan and others, he also moved an application wherein he mentioned that his brain activity has reduced to 75%. From the previous record/ pleadings of Mr. Mujahid Hussain Naqvi it depicts that he mostly used contemptuous/scandalizing language to undermine the authority of the Court, which is not expected from a lawyer. I am of the view that this may be due to his ailment, which is supported by different medical certificates/applications submitted by him in different cases. However, to his latest stance taken in the application alarming and serious which cannot be taken lightly. In this scenario, his further continuation in legal profession does not appear to be in the interest of legal profession.""
 'Underlining is ours for emphasizing.
6.
 It appears from the impugned notification dated 05th April, 2017, that license of petitioner was cancelled by the Bar Council, on the basis of the aforesaid stricture of the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The petitioner impliedly challenged the vires of the aforesaid observations through the instant constitution petition. We are afraid, the stricture supra, on the basis of which, the impugned notification was issued cannot be expunged by this Court, hence, writ petition is not maintainable. The petitioner could prefer a review petition before the apex Court against the aforesaid observations for expunging the remarks, within 30 days as per the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Supreme Court Rules, 1978.
7.
 A perusal of memorandum of writ petition reveals that petitioner impleaded Shoukat Ali Kiyani, Advocate/Vice Chairman Bar Council, Chaudhary Khalid Yousaf, Advocate, Chairman Executive Committee Bar Council, Registrar Supreme Court of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Chairman Disciplinary Committee, Azad Jammu and Kashmir Bar Council as respondents Nos. 3, 4, 6 and 7, respectively. No any reasons whatsoever, has been shown that why the aforesaid respondents have been impleaded in the line of respondents. The petitioner previously filed Writ Petition No.721/2017 and impleaded Hon'ble Senior Puisne Judge of the Supreme Court, as well as Registrar of the Supreme Court, as respondents Nos.6 and 7, which petition was returned in original to him vide order dated 27th April, 2017. The petitioner again impIeaded the same Hon'ble Senior Puisne Judge, who recorded judgment dated 09th October, 2012, through which Government notification dated 09th May, 1998, pertaining to dismissal from service of petitioner was restored, whose lordship is Chairman of Disciplinary Committee, in the line of respondents without any lawful justification. It is an admitted fact that no proceedings were ever initiated by Chairman Disciplinary Committee against petitioner, therefore, writ petition merits dismissal due to mis-joinder of parties, hence, we are not inclined to exercise our extraordinary constitutional jurisdiction in favour of petitioner.
8.
 As per service record of petitioner, he was Secretary to Government BPS-20, however, on the ground of committing forgery and tampering in orders of the Prime Minister, was reverted from BPS-20 to BPS-19,. and then in BPS-18 to BPS-17 and lastly he was reverted as Information Officer BPS-16, and ultimately was dismissed from service vide Government notification dated 09th May, 1998. Against the aforesaid Govt. notification, petitioner filed Writ Petition No.215/1998, titled ""Mujahid Husain Naqvi v. Azad Govt. and others"", before this Court, which was accepted vide order dated 05th October, 1999. Against the aforesaid order, Azad Government and others filed an appeal before the apex Court, in which difference of opinion arose between two Hon'ble Judges of the Supreme Court, resultantly, matter was placed before third Judge, who was at the then time, the Hon'ble Chief Justice (Mr. Justice Sardar Said Muhammad Khan). The appeal filed by Government and others was accepted vide judgment dated 09th October, 2012. He later on moved an application for recalling judgment dated 09th October, 2012, which was also turned down by the apex Court through order dated 05th December, 2015. Meanwhile petitioner succeeded to obtain an order dated 26th October, 2014, from the Prime Minister for reinstatement in Service, then promotion in BPS-21 since 02nd December, 1997 and then retirement on reaching superannuation w.e.f. 27th September, 2009. The order was not acted upon, hence, he filed Writ Petition No.2277/2014, titled ""Mujahid Hussain Naqvi v. Azad Govt. and others"" which was dismissed by Division Bench of this Court handed down by me (Justice M. Tabassum Aftab Alvi, C.J.) with the other member of Bench (Justice Muhammad Sheraz Kiani, J.) vide judgment dated 08th June, 2017. In this regard paragraphs 9, 10 and 11 of the said judgment are reproduced as follows:-
""9. A perusal of application of petitioner reveals that petitioner has deliberately concealed the judgment of the apex Court dated 09.10.2012, and by suppressing fact succeeded to obtain a void order of his reinstatement and promotion in BPS-21 since 02.12.1997, as well as retirement after attaining age of superannuation w.e.f 27.09.2009, who has not invoked jurisdiction of this Court with clean hands, therefore, is not entitled to equitable relief of writ jurisdiction.
10. The petitioner, therefore, filed the instant writ petition with unclean hands which is ex-facie frivolous, as well as, contemptuous to frustrate the judgment and order of the apex Court of the country.
11. The contention of petitioner that he remained almost unconscious from 2010 to 2015, seems to be falsified. A perusal of judgment of the apex Court dated 09.10.2012, makes it abundantly clear that he himself argued his case and pleaded each and every point pertaining to prove his dismissal order as unlawful and each point was authoritatively resolved by the apex Court of the country. He later on also moved an application for recalling judgment dated 09.10.2012, which too was argued by him. The application was turned down by the Hon'ble Court through order dated 05.12.2015, which proved that his assertion about unconsciousness since 2010 to 2015. is falsified. Even otherwise the aforesaid point has not been raised by petitioner in memorandum of his writ petition. It is well settled principle of law that a party cannot be allowed to argue its case vis-a-vis to pleadings ..""
9.
 The petitioner concealed the aforesaid fact of his dismissal from service from the Bar Council, who as per Section 24 subsection (2) of AJ&K Legal Practitioner and Bar Council Act, 1995, could not be allowed to practice as lawyer, for five years, which is reproduced as follow: -
 ""24. Persons qualified for admissions as Advocates
:- (1)
 (a) ..
 (b) .
 (c) .
 
 (i) 
 
 (ii) ..
 
 (iii) .
 (d) 
 (e) 
 (2) A person shall be disqualified from being admitted as an advocate if:-
(i) he was dismissed or removed from service of Government or of a public statutory corporation or a charge involving moral turpitude; unless a period of five years, or such less period as the Government may, by notification in the official Gazette, specify in this behalf, has elapsed since his dismissal or removal; or
 (ii) 
 (iii) ..
 (3) ..
10.
 The petitioner, therefore, remained in the legal profession till cancellation of his license vide notification (sic) dismissed Civil Servant, hence, is not entitled to equitable relief of writ jurisdiction even from this angle.
11.
 The petitioner obtained license to practice in the Judicature of High Court of Azad Jammu and Kashmir on 14th September, 1981, while obtained license of the Supreme Court on 23rd July, 1983. The Azad Jammu and Kashmir Bar Council Act, 1995, was promulgated on 31st December, 1995. At the time of promulgation of the Act, 1995, petitioner was a Civil Servant, hence, was not practicing Advocate. As per record, he was dismissed from service, vide Govt. notification dated 09th May, 1998. After dismissal from service and promulgation of Act, 1995, it appears that he never informed to the Bar Council about his dismissal from service. It reflects that name of petitioner was never inserted in the roll of Advocates maintained by the Bar Council, in accordance with provisions of Sections 21(a), 22(a) and 23(a) of the Act, 1995. Therefore, according to our considered view, petitioner is not entitled to practice in the legal profession till completion of statutory period as postulated under subsection (2) of Section 24 of Act, 1995.
12.
 The legal profession is known as a noble profession having high traditions and has been catering to the need of the society for a very long time past. Thus, the members of legal fraternity are expected to uphold those traditions and serve the society with utmost respect to Courts, sincerely and honestly. If such are the expectations from a noble profession, its members must conduct themselves which may be worthy of emulation. By doing any act which is contrary to the accepted norms and standards of the aforesaid professions, a member of the legal fraternity not only discredits himself but also brings disrepute to the profession to which he belongs. By such acts the credibility and reputation of the profession as a whole comes under cloud. If any member of the profession falls from such standards, he deserves punishment commensurate with the gravity of misconduct. The conduct of petitioner even before this Court in numberless cases also displayed that his further continuation in legal profession does not appear to be in the interest of legal profession.

 SYED MANSOOR ALI SHAH, C.J.---
This judgment will decide the maintainability of the instant petition, as well as, connected Writ Petition No.23578/2016.
2.
 Petitioner has challenged the constitutionality of the geographical allocation of quotas amongst Provinces and other Areas in the national Competitive Examination of the Central Superior Services (CSS) 2015. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that allocation of quota to various Provinces and Areas is in violation of Article 27 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. It is submitted that the period envisaged in the proviso to Article 27(1) i.e., forty years from the commencing day, has long expired and, therefore, the geographical quotas allocated for CSS-2015 by the Federal Public Service Commission (FPSC) vide Press Note dated 13.04.2016 are unconstitutional and illegal.
3.
 At the very outset, M/s Nasar Ahmed, DAG, Anwaar Hussain, Additional Advocate General, Amanullah Kanrani, Advocate General, Balochistan, Syed Ali Raza, Advocate General, AJK and Malik Akhtar Hussain Awan, Assistant Advocate General, KPK raised a preliminary objection regarding the maintainability of the titled petition. They submitted that any interference by this Court would amount to issuing a writ outside the territorial limits of the Court, in as much as, it will affect the rights and privileges (quota) of people belonging to other Provinces and Areas, which is not permissible under Article 199 of the Constitution. They also oppose the main case on merits but that need not be gone into at this stage.
4.
 Messrs Kh. Isaam Bin Haris and Mushtaq Ahmad Mohal Advocates, appearing on behalf of the petitioners submitted that the impugned Press Note has been issued by the Federal Government and there are numerous instances when notifications issued by the Federation and even the federal laws are challenged before this Court and often struck down. Therefore, this Court can also examine the impugned Press Note, which is no different. They placed reliance on Ahmad Yar Chohan v. Federal Public Service Commission and 2 others (1998 MLD 1832) and Mushtaq Ahmad Mohal and others v. The Honourable Lahore High Court, Lahore and others (1997 SCMR 1043) in support of their contentions.
5.
 Considering the gravity of the constitutional question, notices were issued to the Advocates General of other provinces to solicit their viewpoint. Amanullah Kanrani, AG, Balochistan Syed Ali Raza, Advocate General, AJK and Malik Akhtar Hussain Awan, Assistant Advocate General, KPK have tendered appearance and submitted that it would be constitutionally appropriate if the matter is taken up by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan. They submitted that this Court cannot issue a writ affecting the rights or quotas of the people or residents of another Province.
 Mr. Rafey Altaf, Advocate/amicus curiae submits that this Court has jurisdiction to entertain the matter. He submits that in terms of Article 199(2) of the Constitution this Court cannot shy away from enforcing the Constitution. He placed reliance on Messrs Sethi and Sethi Sons through Humayun Khan v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Islamabad and others (2012 PTD 1869), K.B. Threads (Pvt.) Limited through Chief Executive and others v. Zila Nazim, Lahore (Amir Mehmood) and others (PLD 2004 Lahore 376) and High Court Bar Association and others v. Government of Balochistan through Secretary, Home and Tribal Affairs Department and 6 others (PLD 2013 Balochistan 75).
7.
 Mr. Saad Rasool, Advocate/amicus curiae submits that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain this matter as it amounts to transgressing its territorial jurisdiction. He submits that any interference by this Court would take away quota allocated to other Provinces, which is not within the jurisdiction of this Court and can best be dealt with by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan.
8.
 I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and the learned amici curiae. The case law cited at the bar and the relevant provisions of the Constitution have been examined. Preliminary objection regarding maintainability of this petition raises an important constitutional question i.e., Whether the High Court while granting relief to people within its own territorial jurisdiction can simultaneously affect the rights and privileges enjoyed by people in other Provinces? Whether, in such a unique situation, issuance of a writ by this Court is impermissible (hence not maintainable) or inappropriate?

 The above Press Note allocates quota to four Provinces, Gilgit Baltistan, FATA and AJK for the purposes of CSS Examination-2015. It is important to underline that the Press Note lays down a national quota allocation scheme. This allocation cannot be read in isolation for Punjab. 50% quota allocated to Punjab is not separable and cannot be sliced away without affecting the ratios allocated to other Provinces and Areas. The countrywide quota system envisaged in the Press Note is inter-linked and together constitutes a total of 100%. This is a unique case, where any intervention by this Court would upset the equilibrium of national quota system structured for CSS-Examination 2015 and affect the rights and privileges of the people of other Provinces, having smaller quotas.
10.
 What is the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 199? Article 175 states that there shall be a High Court for each Province and no court shall have any jurisdiction save as is or may be conferred on it by the Constitution or by or under any law. The jurisdiction conferred on the High Court under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 is as under:-
199. Jurisdiction of High Court
.---(1) Subject to the Constitution, a High Court may, if it is satisfied that no other adequate remedy is provided by law,--
(a)
 on the application of any aggrieved party, make an order---
(i)
 directing a person performing, within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court, functions in connection with the affairs of the Federation, a Province or a local authority, to refrain from doing anything he is not permitted by law to do, or to do anything he is required by law to do; or
(ii)
 declaring that any act done or proceeding taken within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court by a person performing functions in connection with the affairs of the Federation, a Province or a local authority has been done or taken without lawful authority and is of no legal effect; or
(b)
 on the application of any person, make an order 
(i)
 directing that a person in custody within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court be brought before it so that the Court may satisfy itself that he is not being held in custody without lawful authority or in an unlawful manner; or
(ii)
 requiring a person within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court holding or purporting to hold a public office to show under what authority of law he claims to hold that office; or
(c)
 on the application of any aggrieved person, make an order giving such directions to any person or authority, including any Government exercising any power or performing any function in, or in relation to, any territory within the jurisdiction of that Court as may be appropriate for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights conferred by Chapter 1 of Part II. (emphasis supplied)
Article 201 provides that any decision of a High Court to the extent it decides a question of law or is based upon or enunciates a principle of law shall be binding on all courts subordinate to it. Similarly, Article 202 provides that the High Court may make rules regulating the practice and procedure of any court subordinate to it. While Article 203 provides that High Court shall supervise and control all courts subordinate to it.
11.
 Constitutional terms like ""High Court for each Province"" ""within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court"" and ""all courts subordinate to it"" construct a High Court, which has a provincial character. The term ""within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court"" ubiquitously recurs throughout Article 199 emphasizing the territorial limitation on the jurisdiction of a High Court. The term ""All courts subordinate to it"" repeated in Articles 201, 202 and 203 place the Provincial High Court atop a provincial pyramidical hierarchy of courts. Constitutional architecture of a Provincial High Court provides that while it enjoys judicial power to examine all laws or actions of the federal, provincial and local governments or authorities, it can only do so if the cause of action arises or the respondent government or authority is located or if the impugned act or order affects a person within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court i.e., within the Province. As a corollary, the relief granted or the writ issued by the High Court also remains within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court and can only benefit or affect a person within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court. The relief cannot go beyond the Provincial boundary and affect any other Province or Area or its people. So for example, if a federal law or federal notification is struck down by Lahore High Court, it is struck down for the Province of Punjab or in other words the federal law or the federal notification is no more applicable to the Province of Punjab but otherwise remains valid for all the other Provinces or Areas. Unless of course the Federation or the federal authority complying with the judgment of the Lahore High Court, make necessary amends or withdraw the law or the notification. Which of course would then be open to challenge by the other Provinces or Areas or their people, if they so decide. The other eventuality is that the Federation or the federal authority may or may not enforce the said law or notification in other Provinces, as a matter of administrative decision and instead challenge the judgment of the Lahore High Court before the apex Court of the country. These are the operational repercussions and effects of a judgment, setting aside a federal law or federal notification or decision. However, on a purely constitutional and legal plane, the federal law or federal notification remains in existence for the rest of the country but for the Province of Punjab. This is further fortified by the fact that in case the same federal law or federal notification is challenged in any other Province or Area, the High Court concerned is not bound by the decision of the Lahore High Court and can declare the same federal law or federal notification to be valid law (Reference Article 201 of the Constitution). Therefore, under our Constitution, while our High Courts can judicially examine and strike down a federal law or federal notification, in fact, the said federal law or notification is made non-applicable to the extent of the Province unless the matter is finally decided by the Supreme Court of Pakistan or else if the Federation or the federal authority decide to withdraw or amend the law on their own, in compliance of the judgment.
12.
 What does ""Within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court"" mean? Relying on our constitutional jurisprudence developed over the years and the provincial constitutional architecture of a High Court, writ cannot be issued by High Court against any person which is located geographically outside the territorial limits of the Province, having no physical or legal presence within the Province. See: Sandalbar Enterprises (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Central Board of Revenue and others (PLD 1997 SC 334), Flying Kraft Paper Mills (Pvt.) Ltd., Charsadda v. Central Board of Revenue, Islamabad and 2 others (1997 SCMR 1874), Asghar Hussain v. The Election Commission Pakistan (PLD 1968 SC 387), Messrs Al-Iblagh Limited, Lahore v. The Copyright Board, Karachi and others (1985 SCMR 758) and Messrs Sethi and Sethi Sons through Humayun Khan v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Islamabad and others (2012 PTD 1869).
13.
 It is trite law that if the order or action of the Government or Authority (federal or provincial), present within the Province, affect the rights of a person within the Province, writ can be issued against the said Government or Authority (irrespective of its federal character) and relief given to the aggrieved person located within the Province.
14.
 The impugned Press Note dated 13.04.2016 does this and more, as it provides for quota for all the Provinces. Granting the prayer of the petitioner and striking down the Press Note would grant relief to the people of Punjab but simultaneously upset quotas belonging to the people of other Provinces and Areas. This would amount to issuing a writ beyond the territorial limits of the Court. A Provincial High Court can only grant relief to people of the Province and cannot meddle into the affairs of the other Provinces or affect the rights and privileges of the people of the other Provinces or Areas. 50% quota allocated to the Province of Punjab under the impugned Press Note is not inseparable from the quotas allocated to the other Provinces, hence striking down the Press Note will deprive the quota allocated to all the other Provinces and Areas. Any such writ issued by this Court would also amount to transgressing the territorial limits of the Province. So while technically, for the sake of argument, writ can be issued and relief can be granted to the people of Punjab by abolishing their quota, it would also, at the same time, have the effect of abolishing the quota of other Provinces and Areas. This unique situation begs the question; whether issuance of a writ as prayed for in this case, is constitutionally impermissible or inappropriate?
15.
 In order to answer the above question, let's revisit the federalist structure of our Constitution. ""The commonly accepted features of a federal constitution are: (i) existence of two levels of government; a general government for the whole country and two or more regional governments for different regions within that country; (ii) distribution of competence or power - legislature, executive, judicial, and financial between the general and the regional governments; (iii) supremacy of the constitution that is, the foregoing arrangements are not only incorporated in the constitution but they are also beyond the reach of either governments to the extent that neither of them can unilaterally change nor breach them; (iv) dispute resolution mechanism for determining the competence of the two governments for exercising any power or for performing any function. Federalism is in fact the basis of the division of powers...The principle of Federalism is a central organizational theme of the constitution and represents a political and legal response to underlying social and political realities... A federal system of government allows different provinces to pursue specific policies tailored to the particular concerns and interests of residents in that province. The Principle of Federalism also enables provinces to enact specific statues to pursue specific collective goals, and may promote different cultures and linguistic minorities within a specific province or areas. At the same time federalism allows citizens to construct and achieve goals on a national scale through a Federal Government acting within the limits of its jurisdiction. Consequently, federalism is key to enable citizens to participate in different collectivities and to pursue objectives at local, provincial and national levels.
16.
 Federalism or Federal Principle under our Constitution envisages independent federating units with autonomous legislature, executive and judiciary. Chapter 1 of Part V of the Constitution provides for distribution of legislative power between the Federation and the Provinces. Chapter 2 of the same Part deals with distribution of executive power between the Federation and the Provinces. Chapters 1 to 3 of Part-VII deal with Judicature and the vertical sharing of jurisdiction between the Supreme Court of Pakistan and the High Courts, as well as, the horizontal jurisdictional limits between the High Courts. The Constitution provides a separate High Court for each Province and a Supreme Court of Pakistan with an overarching jurisdiction with an overlapping power with the High Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution. The provincial jurisdictional limits, delineating judicial power between co-ordinate High Courts on the basis of territory and the vertical overlap of judicial power under Article 184(3) between the High Court and the Supreme Court of Pakistan is judicial federalism. Every Provincial High Court and the High Court of the Islamabad Capital Territory has its own jurisdictional space. Any order passed by a High Court is, therefore, effective in the Province and has merely a non-binding persuasive value in other Provinces. Province is a federating unit and has its own legislature, executive and judiciary. Similarly, within the Province, the provincial High Court also functions on the same Federal Principle and exercises judicial power within the limited provincial jurisdictional space or within the Islamabad Capital Territory.
17.
 This Court while it enjoys the power to sit in judgment over the quota allocated to Punjab, the power under Article 199 of the Constitution is ""subject to the Constitution"" and will remain subject to the federal principle discussed above. In the present case the quota in question is inter-linked and combined with the quotas of the other Provinces and any interference by this Court will affect national allocation of quota in other Provinces and Areas. As relief cannot be granted to a person in Punjab without depriving the allocation of quota of the people of other Provinces, such a relief or writ issued by this Court will amount to travelling beyond the territorial limits of the Province and offend the federal principle and the core value of the Constitution.
18.
 It is also important to bear in mind, that theoretically, any other Provincial High Court can easily protect its own provincial quota by protecting the impugned Press Note or declaring it to be intra vires the Constitution. As other High Courts are not bound by the decision of the Lahore High Court, the possibility of multiple decisions or interpretations of the same federal law or federal notification cannot be ruled out, leaving behind the FPSC in total chaos, which could only be settled by the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Therefore, in a matter, where enforcement of a decision of a High Court is not possible, is it proper to exercise jurisdiction?
19.
 Another dimension of the case is the principle of forum non conveniens which is a discretionary power that allows courts to dismiss a case where another court, or forum, is much better suited to hear the case. This dismissal does not prevent a plaintiff from refiling his or her case in the more appropriate forum: The doctrine allows a court with jurisdiction over a case to dismiss it because the convenience of the parties and the interest of justice would be better served if the case were brought in a court having proper jurisdiction in another venue. ""The doctrine of forum non conveniens, i.e., that some other forum is more ""appropriate"" in the sense of more suitable for the ends of justice, was developed by the Scottish courts in the nineteenth century, and was adopted (with some modifications) in the United States. The Scots rule is that the court may decline to exercise jurisdiction, after giving consideration to the interests of the parties and the requirements of justice, on the ground that the case cannot be suitably tried in the Scottish court nor full justice be done there, but only in another court. The basic principle is that.... the court is satisfied that there is some other available forum, having competent jurisdiction, which is the appropriate forum for the trial of the action, i.e. in which the case may be tried more suitably for the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice. Applying this principle to the facts of the present case, the matter in hand, can best be resolved at the Supreme Court of Pakistan.
20.
 Considering the principles discussed above, if impugned Press Note dated 13.04.2016, for the sake of argument, is struck down by this Court it will not only abolish the Punjab quota but also the quota of other Provinces for the purposes of CSS Examination. I am, therefore, of the considered view that interference by this Court would be constitutionally inappropriate and impermissible. Therefore, for the multiple reasons narrated above, I decline to exercise jurisdiction in this matter and leave the parties to approach the august Supreme Court of Pakistan for the redressal of their grievance, if so advised.
21.
 This petition is, therefore, dismissed.

 The above Press Note allocates quota to four Provinces, Gilgit Baltistan, FATA and AJK for the purposes of CSS Examination-2015. It is important to underline that the Press Note lays down a national quota allocation scheme. This allocation cannot be read in isolation for Punjab. 50% quota allocated to Punjab is not separable and cannot be sliced away without affecting the ratios allocated to other Provinces and Areas. The countrywide quota system envisaged in the Press Note is inter- linked and together constitutes a total of 100%. This is a unique case, where any intervention by this Court would upset the equilibrium of national quota system structured for CSS-Examination 2015 and affect the rights and privileges of the people of other Provinces, having smaller quotas.

 What is the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 199? Article 175 states that there shall be a High Court for each Province and no court shall have any jurisdiction save as is or may be conferred on it by the Constitution or by or under any law. The jurisdiction conferred on the High Court under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 is as under:-
199. Jurisdiction of High Court
.---(1) Subject to the Constitution, a High Court may, if it is satisfied that no other adequate remedy is provided by law,--
(a)
 on the application of any aggrieved party, make an order---
(i)
 directing a person performing, within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court, functions in connection with the affairs of the Federation, a Province or a local authority, to refrain from doing anything he is not permitted by law to do, or to do anything he is required by law to do; or
(ii)
 declaring that any act done or proceeding taken within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court by a person performing functions in connection with the affairs of the Federation, a Province or a local authority has been done or taken without lawful authority and is of no legal effect; or
(b)
 on the application of any person, make an order 
(i)
 directing that a person in custody within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court be brought before it so that the Court may satisfy itself that he is not being held in custody without lawful authority or in an unlawful manner; or
(ii)
 requiring a person within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court holding or purporting to hold a public office to show under what authority of law he claims to hold that office; or
(c)
 on the application of any aggrieved person, make an order giving such directions to any person or authority, including any Government exercising any power or performing any function in, or in relation to, any territory within the jurisdiction of that Court as may be appropriate for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights conferred by Chapter 1 of Part II. (emphasis supplied)
Article 201 provides that any decision of a High Court to the extent it decides a question of law or is based upon or enunciates a principle of law shall be binding on all courts subordinate to it. Similarly, Article 202 provides that the High Court may make rules regulating the practice and procedure of any court subordinate to it. While Article 203 provides that High Court shall supervise and control all courts subordinate to it.
11.
 Constitutional terms like ""High Court for each Province"" ""within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court"" and ""all courts subordinate to it"" construct a High Court, which has a provincial character. The term ""within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court"" ubiquitously recurs throughout Article 199 emphasizing the territorial limitation on the jurisdiction of a High Court. The term ""All courts subordinate to it"" repeated in Articles 201, 202 and 203 place the Provincial High Court atop a provincial pyramidical hierarchy of courts. Constitutional architecture of a Provincial High Court provides that while it enjoys judicial power to examine all laws or actions of the federal, provincial and local governments or authorities, it can only do so if the cause of action arises or the respondent government or authority is located or if the impugned act or order affects a person within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court i.e., within the Province. As a corollary, the relief granted or the writ issued by the High Court also remains within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court and can only benefit or affect a person within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court. The relief cannot go beyond the Provincial boundary and affect any other Province or Area or its people. So for example, if a federal law or federal notification is struck down by Lahore High Court, it is struck down for the Province of Punjab or in other words the federal law or the federal notification is no more applicable to the Province of Punjab but otherwise remains valid for all the other Provinces or Areas. Unless of course the Federation or the federal authority complying with the judgment of the Lahore High Court, make necessary amends or withdraw the law or the notification. Which of course would then be open to challenge by the other Provinces or Areas or their people, if they so decide. The other eventuality is that the Federation or the federal authority may or may not enforce the said law or notification in other Provinces, as a matter of administrative decision and instead challenge the judgment of the Lahore High Court before the apex Court of the country. These are the operational repercussions and effects of a judgment, setting aside a federal law or federal notification or decision. However, on a purely constitutional and legal plane, the federal law or federal notification remains in existence for the rest of the country but for the Province of Punjab. This is further fortified by the fact that in case the same federal law or federal notification is challenged in any other Province or Area, the High Court concerned is not bound by the decision of the Lahore High Court and can declare the same federal law or federal notification to be valid law (Reference Article 201 of the Constitution). Therefore, under our Constitution, while our High Courts can judicially examine and strike down a federal law or federal notification, in fact, the said federal law or notification is made non-applicable to the extent of the Province unless the matter is finally decided by the Supreme Court of Pakistan or else if the Federation or the federal authority decide to withdraw or amend the law on their own, in compliance of the judgment.
12.
 What does ""Within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court"" mean? Relying on our constitutional jurisprudence developed over the years and the provincial constitutional architecture of a High Court, writ cannot be issued by High Court against any person which is located geographically outside the territorial limits of the Province, having no physical or legal presence within the Province. See: Sandalbar Enterprises (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Central Board of Revenue and others (PLD 1997 SC 334), Flying Kraft Paper Mills (Pvt.) Ltd., Charsadda v. Central Board of Revenue, Islamabad and 2 others (1997 SCMR 1874), Asghar Hussain v. The Election Commission Pakistan (PLD 1968 SC 387), Messrs Al-Iblagh Limited, Lahore v. The Copyright Board, Karachi and others (1985 SCMR 758) and Messrs Sethi and Sethi Sons through Humayun Khan v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Islamabad and others (2012 PTD 1869).
13.
 It is trite law that if the order or action of the Government or Authority (federal or provincial), present within the Province, affect the rights of a person within the Province, writ can be issued against the said Government or Authority (irrespective of its federal character) and relief given to the aggrieved person located within the Province.
14.
 The impugned Press Note dated 13.04.2016 does this and more, as it provides for quota for all the Provinces. Granting the prayer of the petitioner and striking down the Press Note would grant relief to the people of Punjab but simultaneously upset quotas belonging to the people of other Provinces and Areas. This would amount to issuing a writ beyond the territorial limits of the Court. A Provincial High Court can only grant relief to people of the Province and cannot meddle into the affairs of the other Provinces or affect the rights and privileges of the people of the other Provinces or Areas. 50% quota allocated to the Province of Punjab under the impugned Press Note is not inseparable from the quotas allocated to the other Provinces, hence striking down the Press Note will deprive the quota allocated to all the other Provinces and Areas. Any such writ issued by this Court would also amount to transgressing the territorial limits of the Province. So while technically, for the sake of argument, writ can be issued and relief can be granted to the people of Punjab by abolishing their quota, it would also, at the same time, have the effect of abolishing the quota of other Provinces and Areas. This unique situation begs the question; whether issuance of a writ as prayed for in this case, is constitutionally impermissible or inappropriate?
15.
 In order to answer the above question, let's revisit the federalist structure of our Constitution. ""The commonly accepted features of a federal constitution are: (i) existence of two levels of government; a general government for the whole country and two or more regional governments for different regions within that country; (ii) distribution of competence or power - legislature, executive, judicial, and financial between the general and the regional governments; (iii) supremacy of the constitution that is, the foregoing arrangements are not only incorporated in the constitution but they are also beyond the reach of either governments to the extent that neither of them can unilaterally change nor breach them; (iv) dispute resolution mechanism for determining the competence of the two governments for exercising any power or for performing any function. Federalism is in fact the basis of the division of powers...The principle of Federalism is a central organizational theme of the constitution and represents a political and legal response to underlying social and political realities... A federal system of government allows different provinces to pursue specific policies tailored to the particular concerns and interests of residents in that province. The Principle of Federalism also enables provinces to enact specific statues to pursue specific collective goals, and may promote different cultures and linguistic minorities within a specific province or areas. At the same time federalism allows citizens to construct and achieve goals on a national scale through a Federal Government acting within the limits of its jurisdiction. Consequently, federalism is key to enable citizens to participate in different collectivities and to pursue objectives at local, provincial and national levels.
16.
 Federalism or Federal Principle under our Constitution envisages independent federating units with autonomous legislature, executive and judiciary. Chapter 1 of Part V of the Constitution provides for distribution of legislative power between the Federation and the Provinces. Chapter 2 of the same Part deals with distribution of executive power between the Federation and the Provinces. Chapters 1 to 3 of Part-VII deal with Judicature and the vertical sharing of jurisdiction between the Supreme Court of Pakistan and the High Courts, as well as, the horizontal jurisdictional limits between the High Courts. The Constitution provides a separate High Court for each Province and a Supreme Court of Pakistan with an overarching jurisdiction with an overlapping power with the High Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution. The provincial jurisdictional limits, delineating judicial power between co-ordinate High Courts on the basis of territory and the vertical overlap of judicial power under Article 184(3) between the High Court and the Supreme Court of Pakistan is judicial federalism. Every Provincial High Court and the High Court of the Islamabad Capital Territory has its own jurisdictional space. Any order passed by a High Court is, therefore, effective in the Province and has merely a non-binding persuasive value in other Provinces. Province is a federating unit and has its own legislature, executive and judiciary. Similarly, within the Province, the provincial High Court also functions on the same Federal Principle and exercises judicial power within the limited provincial jurisdictional space or within the Islamabad Capital Territory.
17.
 This Court while it enjoys the power to sit in judgment over the quota allocated to Punjab, the power under Article 199 of the Constitution is ""subject to the Constitution"" and will remain subject to the federal principle discussed above. In the present case the quota in question is inter-linked and combined with the quotas of the other Provinces and any interference by this Court will affect national allocation of quota in other Provinces and Areas. As relief cannot be granted to a person in Punjab without depriving the allocation of quota of the people of other Provinces, such a relief or writ issued by this Court will amount to travelling beyond the territorial limits of the Province and offend the federal principle and the core value of the Constitution.
18.
 It is also important to bear in mind, that theoretically, any other Provincial High Court can easily protect its own provincial quota by protecting the impugned Press Note or declaring it to be intra vires the Constitution. As other High Courts are not bound by the decision of the Lahore High Court, the possibility of multiple decisions or interpretations of the same federal law or federal notification cannot be ruled out, leaving behind the FPSC in total chaos, which could only be settled by the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Therefore, in a matter, where enforcement of a decision of a High Court is not possible, is it proper to exercise jurisdiction?
19.
 Another dimension of the case is the principle of forum non conveniens which is a discretionary power that allows courts to dismiss a case where another court, or forum, is much better suited to hear the case. This dismissal does not prevent a plaintiff from refiling his or her case in the more appropriate forum: The doctrine allows a court with jurisdiction over a case to dismiss it because the convenience of the parties and the interest of justice would be better served if the case were brought in a court having proper jurisdiction in another venue. ""The doctrine of forum non conveniens, i.e., that some other forum is more ""appropriate"" in the sense of more suitable for the ends of justice, was developed by the Scottish courts in the nineteenth century, and was adopted (with some modifications) in the United States. The Scots rule is that the court may decline to exercise jurisdiction, after giving consideration to the interests of the parties and the requirements of justice, on the ground that the case cannot be suitably tried in the Scottish court nor full justice be done there, but only in another court. The basic principle is that.... the court is satisfied that there is some other available forum, having competent jurisdiction, which is the appropriate forum for the trial of the action, i.e. in which the case may be tried more suitably for the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice. Applying this principle to the facts of the present case, the matter in hand, can best be resolved at the Supreme Court of Pakistan.
20.
 Considering the principles discussed above, if impugned Press Note dated 13.04.2016, for the sake of argument, is struck down by this Court it will not only abolish the Punjab quota but also the quota of other Provinces for the purposes of CSS Examination. I am, therefore, of the considered view that interference by this Court would be constitutionally inappropriate and impermissible. Therefore, for the multiple reasons narrated above, I decline to exercise jurisdiction in this matter and leave the parties to approach the august Supreme Court of Pakistan for the redressal of their grievance, if so advised.
21.
 This petition is, therefore, dismissed.

 ZAFAR AHMED RAJPUT, J.---
Through instant Criminal Bail Application, under section 497 of Cr.P.C., the applicant/accused, namely, Muhammad Laiq alias Suhno son of Dodo Khan seeks post-arrest bail in case FIR No.04 of 2017, registered under section 9(c) of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 (hereinafter ""the Act"") at Police Station Rehmatpur, Distt. Larkana. His earlier application for grant of bail being No. 290 of 2017 was rejected by the learned Special Judge C.N.S. Act, Larkana, vide order dated 18.03.2017.
2.
 Briefly stated facts of the case are that on 18.01.2017, upon receiving spy information during patrolling that the applicant/accused was going from Chandka Bridge to Bazigar Bridge hauling Charas, the complainant S.I.P. Ali Bashir Jagirani of C.I.A., Larkana, along with subordinate staff, reached the pointed place at 1700 hrs., and arrested the accused on being found in possession of three packets of Charas in black polythene bag, which was on being equalized came to three K.Gs., the same was sealed by him at the spot, thereafter, he brought the accused along with case property at police station Rehmatpur where aforesaid FIR was recorded.
3.
 Learned counsel for the applicant/accused has contended that the accused is innocent and has falsely been implicated in this case by the C.I.A. police, who arrested the accused from Nazar Muhallah two days before lodging of the FIR; that despite advance information, the complainant did not associate any private mashir, which has rendered the alleged recovery doubtful; that as per FIR, C.I.A. police recovered three packets of Charas, while the report of chemical analyzer shows that each packet contained two slabs, but the number of slabs have neither been mentioned in the FIR nor even in the memo of recovery, hence no credibility can be attached to alleged recovery; that there is delay of five days in sending the case property to chemical analyzer and no explanation for such delay has been furnished by the prosecution; that as per Ghulam Murtaza's case (PLD 2009 Lahore 362) the alleged offence is punishable for five years and six months, as such, the alleged offence does not fall within the prohibitory clause of section 497, Cr.P.C., hence, the accused is entitled to the concession of bail. In support of his contentions, the learned counsel for the accused has relied upon the case of Ikramullah and others v. The State (2015 SCMR 1002) Waheed Raza Pathan v. The State (2011 YLR 2760) Maqsood Zaman v. The State (2011 YLR 2335) Muhammad Mudasir v. The State (2010 YLR 2910).
4.
 Conversely, the learned A.P.G has vehemently opposed the grant of bail to accused on the grounds that a huge quantity of Charas has been recovered from the possession of accused; that the alleged recovery has been effected from the accused in presence of two official witnesses against whom no ill-will or enmity has been pleaded by the accused; that as per FIR due to non-availability of the private persons at the spot, the C.I.A officials acted as mashirs; that Ghulam Murtaza's case has no application at the bail stage and it is the trial Court that shall decide the quantum of punishment after trial of the accused.
5.
 Heard the learned counsel for the accused as well as A.P.G. for the State and perused the material available on record with their assistance so also the case-law cited by the learned counsel for the accused.
6.
 It appears prime facie that three K. Gs. Charas has been recovered from the accused, who is facing charge under section 9(c) of the Act. The punishment provided under clause (c) of section 9 of the Act for possessing, narcotic drug, psychotropic substance or controlled substance, exceeds from 1 kilogram, is either for death, imprisonment for life or for a term which may extend to fourteen years with fine, which may be up to one million rupees. The entire Charas was sent to chemical examiner for analysis and his report in this regard is positive.
7.
 While considering the submissions made by the learned counsel for the accused, I have tentatively found that the accused was arrested by C.I.A. police but the investigation was conducted by S.I.P Imdad Ali of P.S. Rehmatpur against whom no enmity has been alleged by the accused. It has been mentioned in the FIR, that due to non-availability of private person, the C.I.A. official were made mashirs of recovery. Even otherwise association of any private mashir is not the requirement of the Act in view of Section 25 of the Act, which has excluded the applicability of section 103, Cr.P.C. in narcotics cases. Reliance in this regard may be placed on the case of Zafar v. The State (2008 SCMR 1254). Non-mentioning of the number of slabs in the FIR and memo of recovery is also not fatal to the persecution case when the number of packets has been mentioned. I am also not convinced of the arguments of learned counsel for the accused with regard to delay in sending the case property to chemical analyzer, for the reasons that the alleged recovery was effected from the accused on 18.01.2017 and the case property was deposited with the office of chemical analyzer on 23.01.2017, which was day of Monday and since the office of chemical analyzer's remained closed on Sunday, it was deposited on fifth day. Even otherwise, delay of few days in sending the case property to chemical analyzer is of no consequence for the reasons that Rule 4 of Control of Narcotic Substances (Government Analysts) Rules, 2001, which prescribes 72 hours for sending the contraband articles to Chemical Analyzer, is directory and not mandatory.
8.
 As regard the sentencing policy, formulated by the full bench of honourable Lahore High Court in the case of Ghulam Murtaza (supra), I am in agreement with the learned APG that the same has no application on the case of the accused at the bail stage, as held by the honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Socha Gul v. The State (2015 SCMR 1077).
9.
 So far the case-law cited by the learned counsel for the accused is concerned; I am of the humble view that the same are not applicable in the case of present accused being on distinguishable facts. I am; therefore, of the view that, prima facie, sufficient material is available on record to connect the accused with the commission of alleged offence and no case for granting bail to accused has been made out. Hence, instant bail application is dismissed, accordingly.
10.
 Needless to mention here that the observations made hereinabove are tentative in nature and would not influence the trial Court while deciding the case of the applicant/accused on merits.

 AAMER FAROOQ, J.---
The instant Criminal Revision is directed against orders dated 18.05.2017 as well as 23.05.2017 passed by Judicial Magistrate (1st) Class (West), Islamabad and Sessions Judge (West), Islamabad respectively.
2.
 The facts, leading to the filing of instant petition, are that a FIR (FIR No.52-2017) dated 01.03.2017 was lodged at P.S. Margalla, Islamabad under sections 394/511, P.P.C. In the referred FIR, certain persons were nominated as accused. The police investigated the matter and after that, filed report under section 173, Cr.P.C. before respondent No.4 i.e. Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class (West), Islamabad/Area Magistrate, P.S. Margalla, Islamabad. Supplementary police report was submitted in the FIR adding offence under section 337-A(iii), P.P.C. before learned Judicial Magistrate. The referred court, on 18.05.2017, observed that since the offences are not triable by Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, therefore the matter be placed before the Sessions Judge (West), Islamabad for appropriate orders. On 23.05.2017, the learned Sessions Judge, Islamabad entrusted the matter to the learned Magistrate, Section 30, P.S. Margalla, Islamabad.
3.
 Learned counsel for the petitioner, inter alia, submitted that the procedure adopted by the learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Islamabad-West/respondent No.4 as well as the Sessions Judge/respondent No.2 is not in accordance with law and is contrary to the provisions of section 190(2) as well as 193, Cr.P.C. In this behalf, it was contended that reference could only be made to the Sessions Judge concerned, if the offence is exclusively triable by the Sessions Court whereas in the instant case, the offences are triable by the Sessions Court or Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class; that if at the time of passing sentence, if the Magistrate concerned is of the opinion that the sentence, he wishes to award to the accused, is beyond jurisdiction only then, the matter shall be referred to the Sessions Court for the said purpose. In the alternative, it was argued that even if, the Magistrate at the inception is of the opinion that the matter is beyond jurisdiction, then he may return the report under section 173, Cr.P.C. for filing of the same before the court of competent jurisdiction, but cannot send reference as was done in the instant case. In support of their contentions, learned counsel placed reliance on cases reported as 'Wasaya and others v. Sikandar Hayat and others' (2012 SCMR 193), 'Mohsin Ali v. Additional Sessions Judge, Faisalabad and another' (PLD 2013 Lahore 12) and 'Rao Fahd Ali Khan v. The State and another' (2014 PCr.LJ 1071).
4.
 Learned counsel for the accused entered appearance and submitted that offence is to be tried by Judicial Magistrate, Section 30 and Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, is not competent. It was further contended that the instant petition is just a dilating tactic on behalf of petitioner to delay the adjudication of the trial and hearing of the bail petition filed by the accused. In support of their contentions, learned counsel placed reliance on cases reported as PLD 2017 Lahore 106 and PLD 2013 Lahore 12.
5.
 Schedule-II to the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 provides the table of offences provided in Pakistan Penal Code and inter alia the Court by which the same are to be tried. In this behalf, offences under sections 337-A(iii) and 394, P.P.C. are to be tried by Court of Session or Magistrate, 1st Class and section 511, P.P.C. by the court which the offence attempted is triabe. Hence, in the instant case, the offences are triable by the court of session or the Magistrate, 1st Class. Under section 190(1) of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Cr.P.C.), all Magistrates of the 1st Class or any other Magistrate specially empowered by the Provincial Government on the recommendation of the High Court, may take cognizance of an offence, upon receiving a complaint of facts, which constitute such offence; upon a report in writing of such facts made by any police officer; upon recommendation received from any person other than police officer or upon his knowledge of suspicion with such offence has been committed, which he may try or send to the Court of Session for trial. Under subsection (2) of section 190, Cr.P.C. the Magistrate, taking cognizance under subsection (1) of an offence triable exclusively by a Court of Session, shall without recording any evidence, send the case to the court of session for trial. Under section 190, Cr.P.C., the report under section 173, Cr.P.C. is to be filed by the police before the concerned Magistrate and if he is of the opinion that such offence is committed, he may try the offence or send to the court of Session for trial. Where a Magistrate takes cognizance of a case exclusively triable by a Court of Session, he shall without recording any evidence, send the case to the Court of Session for trial.
6.
 In the instant case, the offences in question are triable either by Court of Session or Magistrate of 1st Class. Since the offences are not exclusively triable by the Court of Session therefore the matter should not have been referred under section 190(2), Cr.P.C. Similarly, under section 193, Cr.P.C., the Court of Session is not to take cognizance of any offence as the court of original jurisdiction unless the case has been sent to it under section 190(2), Cr.P.C. by a Magistrate duly empowered in this behalf. The power/jurisdiction of the court of Magistrate to pass sentence is provided in section 32, Cr.P.C. and in this behalf, the court of Magistrate 1st Class may pass sentence of imprisonment for a trial not exceeding three years, however, under section 30 ibid, the Provincial Government may confer upon any Magistrate of the 1st Class with power to try as a Magistrate of offences not punishable with death. The maximum sentence attracted, in the instant case, is 10-years which is beyond the jurisdiction/competence of the Judicial Magistrate of 1st Class in light of section 32, Cr.P.C.
7.
 The procedure, which is adopted in such like cases, came under consideration before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in case reported as 'Wasaya and others v. Sikandar Hayat and others' (2012 SCMR 193) and it was observed that in terms of section 30, Cr.P.C., a Magistrate 1st Class is empowered to try all offences except those punishable with death. The matter was further lucidly discussed in case reported as 'Mohsin Ali v. Additional Sessions Judge, Faisalabad and another' (PLD 2013 Lahore 12) and it was observed as follows:-
""8. Now the question left for determination is whether offence under section 367, P.P.C. is triable by the Court of Session or by a Magistrate 1st Class having the powers under section 30 of Cr.P.C. The answer to this question is contained in the cases of Allah Wasaya and Noor Hussain (supra). It was observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in both precedent cases that the quantum of punishment does not itself take away the powers of taking cognizance or trying a case which should have been done under section 187 of the Sea Customs Act itself. It is further observed that the limit on the power of awarding punishment does not affect the competence of a Court to try a case. The Magistrate is duly competent to try the case but all that he cannot do is to impose a sentence which is in excess of his powers. In the case of Allah Wasaya (supra), it was observed by the apex Court that in terms of section 30 of Cr.P.C. a Magistrate of 1st Class could try all offences except those punishable with death. In this case the offence charged against the culprits was under section 336, P.P.C., which was triable by Court of Session as per 2nd Schedule of Code (supra). These judgments make one thing clear that mere quantum of punishment is not enough to take away the jurisdiction of the Court to try the offence. In this connection section 30 of the Code (supra) clearly manifests that the Magistrate of 1st Class may try all the offences the punishment of which does not involve sentence of death. In this respect it is further observed that 2nd Schedule of the Code, according to section 28(3) governs the cases triable by the Courts of different kind. This section cannot be read in isolation to section 30, which contains non obstante clause making an exception that a Magistrate can try all offences not punishable with death. This provision of the section 30, Cr.P.C. excludes applicability of section 28 in clear terms by making an exception to it in respect of Courts mentioned in the column 8 of 2nd Schedule. Accordingly, a Magistrate 1st Class with powers under section 30. Cr.P.C. has the jurisdiction to try all those offences, which are not punishable with death. In view of this legal position, one can say safely that the order passed by the Judicial Magistrate on 4-11-2010 by sending Reference to learned Sessions Judge for entrusting the case to the Court of Session as offence under section 367, P.P.C. not triable by it, is an illegal exercise of jurisdiction by the Court concerned. Further the learned Sessions Judge had exercised its jurisdiction mechanically by entrusting the trial of the case to the Court of Addl. Sessions Judge without examining the fact that a Magistrate section 30 may try all the offences except those involving death sentence.""
Similarly, in case reported as 'Noor Hussain v. The State' (PLD 1996 Supreme Court 68), it was observed as follows:-
""Section 187 of the Sea Customs Act provides that all offences under the Sea Customs Act, except those cognizable under section 182, may be tried summarily by a Magistrate, provides that the Schedule thereto, so far as they concern special goods, they shall be tried by a Court having powers not inferior to those of a Magistrate of the First Class. It will be observed from this that the quantum of the punishment does not by itself take away the power of taking cognizance of or trying a case, which could have been done under section 187 of the Sea Customs Act itself. The limit on the powers of awarding punishment does not affect the competent of a Court to try the case. The Magistrate is duly competent to try the case but all that he cannot do is to impose a sentence which is in excess of his powers. In the present case, the sentence imposed, as already stated, was of the duration of two years which was well within the powers of a Magistrate of the First Class in accordance with the Third Schedule to the Criminal Procedure Code.""
In view of the above judgments mere fact that quantum of punishment is beyond the powers of a Magistrate is not enough to take away the jurisdiction of the court to try the offence. In the second Schedule to Cr.P.C, the offences in question are triable by Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class or Court of Session therefore the Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class does have the jurisdiction in the matter. The fact that the sentence prescribed for the offences in question is beyond the competence of the Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class would not take away his jurisdiction. Even otherwise, if a court is of the opinion that the matter is beyond jurisdiction/competence, reference cannot be send to the Session Court under section 190, Cr.P.C. rather report under section 173, Cr.P.C. is to be returned for filing of the same before the court of competent jurisdiction. Reference in this regard is placed on case reported as 'Rao Fahd Ali Khan v. The State and another' (2014 PCr.LJ 1071). In case reported as Hassan v. The State and another (PLD 2017 Lahore 106) the Honourable Lahore High Court observed as follows:-
10. Undoubtedly, an Assistant Sessions Judge is a judicial officer, who for all purposes, exercises powers whish vest in Magistrate Section-30 of the Code. Meaning thereby that a Magistrate Section-30 can rightly be termed as an Assistant Sessions Judge. In this way, a Magistrate Section-30 is not competent to impose sentence to an accused beyond 07 years' imprisonment.
11. From the above mentioned discussion, it is evident that competency of the learned Trial Court, being Magistrate Section 30 was to award maximum sentence of 07 years' R.I. In this way, as provided under Section 439(3) of the Code, the learned revisional court was not competent to enhance the sentence, beyond jurisdiction of the learned Trial Court.
8.
 In view of above, instant Criminal Revision is allowed. The impugned orders dated 18.05.2017 as well as 23.05.2017 are set aside. Consequently, the report under section 173, Cr.P.C. shall be deemed to be pending before Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, P.S. Margalla Islamabad, who shall act in accordance with law and observations made hereinabove.

 ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, J.---
Petitioner Iftikhar Ahmad, seeks bail in case FIR No.23 dated 10.03.2017, registered under section 9(c), Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997, in Police Station ANF RD, KP, Peshawar.
2.
 As per contents of FIR, on 10.03.2017 at 17.00 hours, on receipt of spy information qua trafficking of Acetic Anhydride (a chemical used in preparation of heroin), by Iftikhar Ahmad (present petitioner), in his Suzuki motorcar bearing registration No.BC.8491, Peshawar from Peshawar to Karkhano, Hafiz Sohail Umar Gondal, Inspector ANF along with other ANF personnel, conducted a barricade near Speen Jumat University Town Peshawar and at 17.00 hours, intercepted the aforesaid vehicle, being driven by the petitioner. On search, of the car, a cane having 4.500 Kgs Acetic Anhydride were recovered, out of which 10 Milliliter were separated for the purpose of chemical analysis by the FSL. The petitioner was arrested, hence, this case.
3.
 Learned counsel for the petitioner vehemently argued that the alleged recovered Acetic Anhydride is an acid used for multiple purposes i.e. drying clothes etc and can also be used for surfacing/polishing of heroin, hence cannot be held as narcotics drug defined under section 2(s) of the Act of 1997.
4.
 I am not impressed by the arguments of learned counsel for the petitioner for the reason that section 6 of the Act of 1997, says that no one shall produce, manufacture, extract, prepare, possess, offer for sale, sell, purchase, distribute, deliver on any terms whatsoever, transport, dispatch, any narcotic drug, psychotropic substance or controlled substance except for medical, scientific or industrial purposes in the manner and subject to such conditions as may be specified by or under this Act or any other law for the time being in force. Narcotic drug has been defined under section 2(s) of the Act of 1997 in the following manner:-
""Narcotic drug"" means coca leaf, cannabis, heroin, opium, poppy straw and all manufactured drugs.""
Similarly, 
""psychotropic substance""
 is defined under section 2(za) of the Act of 1997, as under:-
""Psychotropic substance""
 means the substances, specified in the Schedule to this Act and such substances as the Federal Government may, by notification in the official Gazette, declare to be a psychotropic substance"".
According to definition of ""psychotropic substance"", psychotropic substance means the substances specified in the Schedule to this Act and such substances as the Federal Government may, by notification in the official Gazette, declare to be a psychotropic substance.
 Section 2-K of the Act of 1997 defines 
""Controlled substances"" 
means any substance, which may be used for the production or manufacture of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substance. The recovered contraband under the name of Acetic Anhydride falls within the ambit of ""manufacture drug"" as defined under section 2(q) of the Act, 1997 as well as notified in the official gazette made in pursuance of the recommendations of an International Drugs Control Convention and incorporated in Schedule-V (Controlled Chemicals), Division-II of Drugs of Abuse Controlled Chemicals, Equipment and Materials) Rules, 2001.
 As per scientific research the Acetic Anhydride is the primary substance for making heroin from opium and morphine. In view of the above, the possession of recovered chemical i.e. Acetic anhydride being a primary substance used for production of heroin is manifest contravention of the provisions of section 6, punishment for which has been provided under section 9 of the Act of 1997.
5.
 Reverting to the merit of the case, it appears from the record that petitioner has been arrested red handed on the spot and huge quantity of Acetic Anhydride, used in preparation of heroin, has been recovered from the diggi of the car which was in his explosive possession and control. The positive FSL report and statements of the recovery witnesses under section 161, Cr.P.C. substantiate the version of the Seizing Officer. Nothing is on the record to show any ill will or enmity of the of the PWs against the petitioner. On tentative assessment of the material discussed above, reasonable grounds exist which prima facie connect the petitioner with the commission of offence, hence, he is not entitled to the concession of bail.
6.
 Accordingly, this petition being meritless is hereby dismissed.

 ZAHEER-UD-DIN KAKAR, J.---
This criminal revision petition has been filed against the order dated 02.6.2016 ""the impugned order"", passed by the Special Judge, Anti-terrorism Court-I, Quetta ""the trial Court"" where the application under Section 23 of Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 (A.T.A., 1997) for transfer of the case to an ordinary court of criminal jurisdiction from Special Court was rejected.
2.
 Precisely stated, the facts of the case are that on.18.10.2011, the complainant lodged a case vide FIR No.205 of 2011, under sections 302, 147, 148, 149, P.P.C. at Shalkot Police Station, Quetta alleging therein that on the fateful day he was present on his duty. At about 11:50 a.m. he received information from his home that accused persons Mohabbat Khan, Salimullah, Kalimullah, Khalilullah, Khalil-ur-Rehman and Najibullah, who are his relatives came to his house and made firing as a result of which, his daughter namely Abrira aged about 16 years was seriously injured, later in time succumbed to injuries. The motive behind the act was abduction of Abrira in 2010 by the accused and her return by their (accused) mother. The persons nominated in the FIR were not arrested, thus, incomplete challan was submitted before the Court of Sessions Judge, Quetta. The proceedings of this case was stayed by this Court vide order dated 24.10.2014 till decision of the private complaint filed by the complainant.
3.
 Thereafter, Mst. Shani Qayum, the wife of (Abdul Qayum the complainant of FIR No.205 of 2011) filed an application under section 22-A, Cr.P.C. before the Court of Additional Sessions Judge-IV, Quetta for lodging of second FIR against the petitioners, but the trial Court rejected the application. The order upheld up to the Hon'ble Supreme Court. Thereafter, Mst. Shani Qayum filed a private complaint against the petitioners with the allegation of committing murder of deceased Abrira on account of honour killing.
4.
 On the complaint, the trial commenced and on 19.12.2013, the charge was framed by the Additional Sessions Judge-IV, Quetta to which the petitioner pleaded not guilty. Thereafter, the trial Court recorded statement of Mst. Shani and Dr. Ali Mardan, Medico-legal Officer. Thereafter, the complaint was transferred to the Anti-Terrorism Court-I, Quetta by the order of this Court. On 16.6.2015, Judge, Anti-Terrorism Court-I, Quetta framed charge under sections 302, 34, P.P.C. read with section 7 of ATA to which the petitioners pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The trial Court recorded statements of complainant Mst. Shani and Medico Legal Officer.
5.
 During pendency of the case, an application under section 23 of A.T.A., 1997 was moved on behalf of accused (petitioners). The trial Court through order dated 02.6.2016 rejected the application, hence this petition.
6.
 Learned counsel for the petitioners contended that the impugned order passed by the trial Court is against law and facts; that the trial Court has mis-appreciated the facts of the case; that the provisions of section 6, A.T.A., 1997 not attracted in this case, thus, the same is liable to be set aside and the case be transferred to an ordinary Court of criminal jurisdiction. In support of his contention, the learned counsel for the petitioner has placed reliance upon PLD 2016 SC 195.
7.
 On the other hand, the learned State counsel assisted by the learned counsel for respondent No. 1 opposed the petition and supported the impugned order.
8.
 We have heard, the learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the available record. In order to determine, as to whether an offence would fall within the ambit of section 6 the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, it is essential to have a glance over the allegations made in the private complaint, filed by Mst. Shani Qayum, in which she specifically stated that her daughter was murdered in the name of honour killing by the petitioners, material collected during the investigation and surrounding circumstances. It is also necessary to examine whether the ingredients of alleged offence have any nexus with the object of the case as contemplated under sections 6, 7 and 8 thereof. Whether a particular act is an act of terrorism or not, the motivation, object, design and purpose behind the said act is to be seen. It is also to be seen as to whether the said act has created a sense of fear and insecurity in the public or in a section of the public or community or in any sect, there is no cavil to the proposition that where action results in striking terror or creating fear, panic, sensation, helplessness and sense of insecurity among the people in the particular area it amounts to terror and such an action squarely falls within the ambit of section 6 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 and shall be triable by a Special Court, constituted for such purpose. On the above touchstone, if one goes through the record of the case, one could reach to an irresistible conclusion that the case of the petitioners does not fall within the ambit of Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. It is settled law that while deciding the question of jurisdiction, it would be necessary to examine that the ingredients of alleged offence has any nexus with the object of Anti Terrorism Act, 1997. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, in its landmark judgment titled as Khuda-e-Noor v. The State reported in PLD 2016 SC 195 defined section 6 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 and declared that the honour killing does not fall within the ambit of section 6 of ATA and transferred the case from the Anti-Terrorism Court to a Court of Ordinary jurisdiction. The relevant para 4 of the said judgment is reproduced herein below:
""The case in hand was a case of a private motive set up in the FIR and during the trial the motive setup in the FIR was changed by the prosecution and an element of honour killing was introduced but even that did not change the character of the offence which was nothing but a private offence committed in the privacy of a home with no design or purpose contemplated by section 6(1)(b) or (c) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. We have, thus, entertained no manner of doubt that the allegations leveled against the appellant and his co-accused in the present criminal case did not attract the jurisdiction of an Anti-Terrorism Court, the learned Sessions Judge. Mastung was not justified in transferring the case to an Anti-Terrorism Court and the High Court was also not legally correct to dismissing the appellants' revision petition. This appeal is, therefore, allowed, the impugned order passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Mastung as well as the High Court of Balochistan, Quetta set aside and it is declared that the appellants' case is to be tried by a Court of ordinary jurisdiction.""
9.
 Keeping in view, the dicta as laid down in the aforementioned judgment, we have no hesitation to reach at the irresistible conclusion that ingredients of section 6, ATA are not attracted in this case. Thus, the criminal revision petition is allowed and the impugned order dated 02.6.2016, passed by the trial Court is set aside. The Special Case No.102 of 2015 pending adjudication before the Anti-Terrorism Court-I, Quetta is transferred to the Court of Additional Sessions Judge-IV, Quetta, with direction to decide the case according to law, preferably within a period of three months.

 ABDULLAH BALOCH, J.---
This common judgment disposes of Constitutional Petition No.(T)103 of 2016 and Constitutional Petition No.(T) 80 of 2016 filed by the petitioner Muhammad alias Khuda Bakhsh son of Jalal resident of Baloch Abad Mand under Article 199 of Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan read with section 561-A, Cr.P.C. against the respondent with the following prayer.
""It is therefore, accordingly respectfully prayed that on the above explained circumstances the respondent No. 2 be directed to grant the benefit of section 382- B, Cr.P.C. and include the under trial period of the conviction in his sentence he further be directed to allow the special remission to the petitioner granted by the central as well as provincial Governments during his period of the convictions, in the interest of justice, equity and fairplay"".
2.
 Brief facts of the case are that the petitioner was booked in FIR No. 28 of 2006 under sections 365-A, 324, 353, 186 and 34, P.P.C. registered with Police Station Turbat on 3rd March, 2006.
3.
 After proper investigation, Challan was submitted before the learned Court of ATC Mekran at Turbat who after completion of trial convicted the petitioner under section 365-A read with section 7(e) of the Anti-Terrorism, Act, 1997 and also ordered that all the movable and immovable property of the accused be forfeited in favour of the state, vide judgment dated 27th May, 2006.
4.
 The said judgment was assailed before this Court vide Criminal Appeal No. 118 of 2006 and the same was dismissed vide judgment dated 27th November, 2006.
5.
 Thereafter the petitioner filed appeal before the honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan, which was dismissed, however, the benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C. was granted in favour of the petitioner.
6.
 The learned counsel for the petitioner contended that as principle of law, the rights of every prisoner are governed under the Jail Manual and Rules every prisoner is entitled for special remissions granted by the Federal and Provincial Government from time to time; that such remissions were refused by the jail authorities to the petitioner; that Article 25 of Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan protects the rights of each citizen of Pakistan to be treated equally, but the appellant was not treated at par rather was discriminated to be extended the benefit of special remissions, that the jail authorities mis-interpreted the law and mis-exercised their authority for not granting the benefit of such remission to the petitioner.
7.
 On the other hand, the learned DPG appearing on behalf of State has strongly opposed the arguments so advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioner and contended that the offence committed by the petitioner under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 whereby such remissions are not extended to such convicts. As envisaged under section 21-F of the Act 1997 wherein the concession of special remissions were not extended to the accused involved in cases of terrorism, as such, the petitioner is not entitled to claim for such remissions under the Act. He further contended that the conviction of the petitioner was upheld up to the honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan and nowhere the petitioner agitated for concession of such remissions to be extended to him, as such, at this belated stage, he could not claim for such remissions.
8.
 We have carefully considered the contentions raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as, the learned DPG and the case law cited by the learned counsel for petitioner.
9.
 It is settled principle of law that the provisions of Article 25(1) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan provides equal protection to the rights of all citizens of Pakistan. For convenience, Article 25 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan is reproduced herein below:-
Article 25. Equality of Citizens
.---(1) All the citizens are equal before law and are entitled to equal protection of law.
 (2) There shall be no discrimination on the basis of sex.
(3) Nothing in this Article shall prevent the State from making any special provision for the protection of women and children.
10.
 Bare perusal of Article 25 of Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan shows that all the citizens living in this country are equal before law and are entitled to equal protection of law i.e. all citizens subjected to law should be treated of similar nature and alike under all circumstances. The equality has to be between the persons and are placed in the same set of circumstances. Similarly, there should be one set of rules for every convict under any law and that the forum of trial and the procedure may be different and the punishment under same laws may be more stringent as compared to the other enactments, but after conviction should be governed under prison rules not under the law operating conviction.
11.
 The petitioner who has been sentenced and convicted by the ATA Court is not being granted special and ordinary remissions under the prison rules. The purpose of remission is to reform the prisoner that it may be incentive to reform towards prisoners and society.
12.
 Though under the provisions of section 21-F of ATA wherein no remission in any sentence was allowed to a person other than a child who is convicted and sentenced for any offence under the said Act only granted by the Government otherwise, section 10(d) of NAB Ordinance similarly has been inserted in the NAB Ordinance, which also shall not entitle any remissions to the convicted prisoner who is convicted and sentenced for any offence under such Ordinance.
13.
 Be that as it may, but keeping in view the provisions of Article 8(1)(2) of Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan wherein, the law inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights declared to be void, moreover, Article 25 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan provided that all the citizens living in this country are equally entitled for protection of law. Reliance is placed on the case of Saleem Raza and 31 others v. The State PLD 2007 Karachi 139 wherein the honourable full bench of Sindh High Court held that no reasonable classification could be attributed as per section 10(d), which singles out a particular class of convicts which are denied remissions, whereas other convicts similarly placed, the provision of section 10(d) of NAB Ordinance was declared as ultra vires of Constitution and liable to be struck down and all prisoners convicted under NAB Ordinance were entitled to such remissions as person convicted under ordinary law.
14.
 Accordingly, the provisions of section 21-F of Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 are declared as ultra vires of the Constitution in the case of Hammad Abbasi v. Superintendent Central Adiala Jail Rawalpindi reported in PLD 2010 Lahore 428 relevant portion whereof reproduced as under:-
12. ""In the light of what has been discussed above, and on the same principle, it is held that the denial of remission to ATA convicts and allowing the same qua those who were convicted under the Anti Corruption laws by the Provincial Government would again be discriminatory, besides, once the benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C. is granted to a convict, then how the benefit of remission can be withheld to that convict, thus the refusal of remission to such convict would tantamount to deprive the liberty of that convict within the contemplation of Article 9 of the Constitution, which provides that"" No person shall be deprived of life or liberty save in accordance with law.
13. For the foregoing reasons this petition is allowed with the result that section 21-F of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 is declared as ultra vires of the Constitution and is liable to be struck down and the Jail Authorities are directed to include all the remissions, which have been denied to petitioner per section 21-F of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997"".
15.
 In view of the aforesaid judgments, we are of the considered opinion that the denial of remissions to the petitioner/convict are discriminatory, besides, once the benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C. is granted to the convict then how the benefit of special or ordinary remissions could be withheld to the convict thus the refusal of such concession tantamounts to deprive the liberty to the convict within the contemplation of Article 9 of Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, which provides that "" No person shall be deprived of life and liberty save in accordance with law"".
16.
 For the forgoing reasons, we are inclined to accept this petition and direct respondent No. 2 Superintendent Central Jail Gadani, to extend all the benefit of special as well as ordinary remissions to the petitioner including with the benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C. from date of his trial till completion of his sentence.

 MUHAMMAD EJAZ SWATI, J.---
The appellant has challenged the validity of the judgment dated 13th June 2009 (hereinafter the ""impugned judgment"") passed by Special Judge Anti-Terrorism Court-I, Quetta (hereinafter the ""trial Court""), whereby the appellant Muhammad Hussain son of Akhtar Ali was convicted under sections 302(b), 109/34, P.P.C. read with sections 7(a) and 21-I of Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 (hereinafter the ""Act, 1997"") and sentenced to death as Tazir with fine of Rs.200,000/- as compensation to be paid to the legal heirs of each deceased i.e. Syed Arif Hussain and Asadullah and in default thereof to further suffer R.I. for two years with benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C. The appellant was further convicted under sections 324, 109, 34, P.P.C. read with sections 7(b) and 21-I of the Act, 1997 for causing grievous injuries to the injured Amjad Ali and sentenced to suffer R.I for 14 years with fine of Rs. 100,000/- as compensation to be paid to the legal heirs of injured Amjad Ali and in case of default thereof to further suffer R.I. for one year with benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C.
 Whereas the trial Court has also sent Murder Reference No. 16 of 2009 for confirmation of death or otherwise.
2.
 The brief facts of the instant case are that on the complaint of Syed Shah Hussain an FIR No. 07 of 2002 dated 27th January, 2002 under sections 302, 324, 109/34, P.P.C. read with sections 7-A and 21-I of the Act, 1997 was registered with Police Station Quaid Abad, Quetta, wherein it was alleged that the deceased Syed Arif was his nephew and on the fateful day, he was present at his house and received an information by phone that Syed Arif was injured, who had been taken to the hospital. He reached to the hospital at about 5:40 p.m., where he came to know that the said Syed Arif succumbed to the injuries. The complainant alleged that he came to know in the hospital that the friends of deceased Syed Arif namely Asadullah and Amjad Ali had also sustained injuries and further he was told that firing was made from a Gray Colour Pajero and in the said incident, Zia son of Ali Murad, Muhammad Hussain son of Akhtar Ali (appellant), Ali Ahmed son of Sabz Ali and Qurban son of Haji Ahmed Ali were involved. All the victims including the deceased had sustained injuries by means of Makarov Pistol. The motive behind the incident was that Qurban son of Haji Ahmed Ali and Syed Muhammad Ali, who is father of deceased, had a business relationship, which turned hostile. Haji Ahmad Ali advanced threats to the complainant that to tell his brother and Muhammad Arif to settle the account with him or in consequence the result would be dangerous. After registration of the FIR, the appellant remained fugitive and the case was tried against him in absentia, as such vide judgment dated 16th August 2003, he was awarded capital punishment. The appellant was arrested from Iran and brought to Quetta on 19th February 2007. Thereafter, he filed an appeal before this Court, which was accepted vide judgment dated 15th September 2008 and the case was remanded to the trial Court for commencing de novo trial of the appellant after providing him full opportunity of hearing in accordance with law. On 9th February 2009, the challan against the appellant was submitted and the charge was framed on 20th February 2009, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
3.
 The prosecution examined six witnesses. It is relevant to mention here that in the earlier round when the case was proceeded in absentia, the statement of one injured namely Amjad Ali (an eye-witness) was recorded by the trial Court, however, after arrest of the appellant, the said witness, according to the prosecution, had died. Whereon, the counsel for the complainant submitted an application along with death certificate of Amjad Ali issued by Nazim of the area, which was obtained by the third Investigating Officer of the case and the same was produced as Ex.P/6-A with the submission that the statement of PW Amjad be placed on record. The defence counsel opposed the contention of the complainant's counsel and prayed for rejection of the application. However, the trial Court allowed the application, as such statement of the aforesaid witness was placed on record.
4.
 When examined under section 342, Cr.P.C. the appellant denied the allegations of the prosecution. He neither examined himself on oath as envisaged under section 340(2), Cr.P.C. nor produced any witness in defence.
5.
 The trial Court vide impugned judgment convicted and sentenced the appellant as mentioned hereinabove.
6.
 Learned counsel for the appellant contended that the complainant Syed Shah Hussain was not an eye-witness of the incident; that PW-1 Shafiqa Bibi was also not an eye-witness of the incident and she had received information from her son Amjad, but he had not been produced; that statement of PW-1 Shafiqa Bibi was taken during investigation on an affidavit dated 24th April 2002, that too after three months of the incident and she could not justify her presence at the place of incident; that the whole case of the prosecution was based upon the statement of injured Amjad recorded in the first round of trial in absence of the appellant on 10th December 2002, regarding which, the conviction of the appellant was set aside being tried in absentia, therefore, the statement of Amjad cannot be used against the appellant for the reason that his death had been disputed by the defence; that the prosecution has failed to establish the death of PW-5 Amjad and in absence of any death certificate of PW-5 Amjad, his statement cannot be used against the appellant; that according to law, the previous statement can only be used, if fair and full opportunity of cross-examination had been provided to the accused, but in this case, no opportunity of cross-examination was provided to the appellant in the previous round, even otherwise punishment awarded to the appellant in absentia was set aside and the said previous trial was held contrary to section 10-a of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973; that while announcing the judgment in absentia, the Hon'ble High Court had declared the proceedings illegal and unconstitutional, as such any statement recorded during illegal proceedings cannot be used against the appellant; that capital punishment has been awarded to the appellant merely on the basis of previous statement of the injured, but the same had not been put to him at the time of his statement recorded under section 342, Cr.P.C; that the trial Court without examining the Nazim, who allegedly issued the death certificate of PW Amjad, no opportunity of cross-examination was provided to the defence, has passed the impugned judgment, which is contrary to law; that the appellant contested the death of PW-5 Amjad, therefore, in such circumstances, it was for the prosecution to have independently proved the criteria laid down under Article 47 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 (hereinafter the ""Order, 1984""), but the trial Court conducted the trial in a haphazard manner without providing proper opportunity to the appellant. He, at the end of his arguments, submitted that in alternate, the capital punishment could not be awarded to the appellant on mere previous statement of an injured, regarding which criteria laid down under Article 47 of the Order, 1984 had not been fulfilled. He placed reliance on the judgments reported in AIR 1945 Kolkata 139, PLD 1958 SC (Pak) 290 and AIR 1944 Lahore 206.
On the other hand, learned Deputy Prosecutor General assisted by the learned counsel for the complainant while controverting the contentions of the learned counsel for the appellant contended that the prosecution besides producing eye-witness i.e. PW-1 Shafiqa Bibi mother of deceased, also produced the statement of injured Amjad PW-5, which was recorded on 10th December 2002 in the previous trial and in the said statement, opportunity of cross-examination was also provided to the learned counsel for the appellant; that recording of statements of prosecution witnesses in absentia was mandate of the Act, 1997, therefore, the said statements cannot be regarded against the law; that previous conviction of the appellant, recorded in absentia, though was set aside by this Court, but the said aspect of the matter would not debar the prosecution to rely upon the statement of PW-5 and in this respect, the third Investigating Officer produced his certificate with regard to death of PW Amjad and the said certificate in respect of death of Amjad was put to the appellant while recording his statement under section 342, Cr.P.C; that, though the statement was submitted by the counsel for the complainant through an application and the said application was accepted by the trial Court vide order dated 5th June 2009 and the said order was not assailed by the appellant further, which had attained finality; that besides statements of PW-1 and PW Amjad, which could be treated under Article 47 of the Order 1984 coupled with recovery of crime empty, recovery of vehicle and medical certificate, are sufficient to prove that the appellant has committed murder of Syed Arif Hussain and Asadullah and caused injuries to Amjad; that there was no mitigating circumstance and the normal sentence was justified; that the appellant was also convicted for making murderous assault upon PW-5 Amjad and awarded him sentence for 14 years with fine of Rs. 100,000/-. He placed reliance on the judgments reported in 2007 YLR 1046, 2013 PCr.LJ 282, PLD 2010 SC 642, PLD 2014 Peshawar 189, 2012 PCr.LJ 768 and PLD 1978 SC 102.
7.
 We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record of case. In the instant case, the appellant after the incident went to hiding. thus after completing the codal formalities, the trial Court proceeded the previous trial in absentia after completing the procedure as provided under section 19(10) of the Act, 1997 and as per provision an Advocate was also appointed and in the previous trial, the statement of prosecution witness PW Amjad Ali was recorded as PW-5 and he was cross-examined by the counsel, appointed by the trial Court. In the previous trial, the trial Court after recording statements of prosecution witnesses including PW-5 Amjad, convicted the appellant and awarded him death sentence, which findings were challenged by the appellant after his arrest. This Court set aside the previous judgment being passed in absentia and the case was remanded for de novo trial.
8.
 After remand, the prosecution examined six PWs. The trial Court relied upon the ocular account by PW-1 Shafiqa and statement of PW Amjad Ali under Article 47 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. PW-1 Shafiqa though narrated the incident and implicated the appellant in the commission of offence, but her testimony required reconsideration on the point of delay. The incident had taken place on 27 January 2002. PW-1 stated to be present at the place of incident, but neither at the time of incident she recorded her statement, nor explained the sufficient reasons for such delay. She appeared after about three months of the incident sworn an affidavit Ex.P/1-A, but no plausible explanation for such inordinate delay had been put forth, therefore, her statement is not safe to be relied upon. In Muhammad Khan v. Muhammad Bakhsh 1998 SCMR 570, it was observed that ""credibility of a witness is looked with serious suspicion, if his statement under section 161, Cr.P.C. recorded with delay without offering plausible explanation. In case of Muhammad Asif v. The State, 2017 SCMR 486, the honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan observed as under:
""There is a long line of authorities/precedents of this court and the High Courts that even one or two days unexplained delay in recording the statement of eye-witnesses would be fatal and testimony of such witnesses cannot be safely relied upon.""
 In the instant case, the only ocular evidence i.e. PW Amjad Ali, whose statement had been taken into consideration under Article 47 of Order, 1984 by the trial Court, in the subsequent proceedings (instant trial) for awarding capital punishment, therefore, this aspect of the matter requires reconsideration/reappraisal by this Court.
 Article 47 of the Order, 1984 is reproduced herein below:
""Relevancy of certain evidence for proving, in subsequent proceeding, the truth of facts therein stated.
 Evidence given by a witness in a judicial proceeding, or before any person authorized by law to take it is relevant for the purpose of proving, in a subsequent judicial proceeding, or in a later stage of the same judicial proceeding, the truth of the facts which it states, when the witness is dead or cannot be found, or is incapable of giving evidence, or is kept out of the way by the adverse party, or if his presence cannot be obtained without an amount of delay or expense which, under the circumstances of the case, the Court considers unreasonable;
 Provided that;
 the proceeding was between the same parties or their representatives-in-interest;
the adverse party in the first proceeding had the right and opportunity to cross-examine;
the question in issue were substantially the same in the first as in the second proceeding.""
 Article 47 of the Order, 1984 deals relevancy of certain evidence for proving, in subsequent proceeding, the truth of facts therein. Evidence given by a witness in a judicial proceeding, or before any person authorized by law to take it is relevant for the purpose of proving, in a subsequent judicial proceeding, or in a later stage of the same judicial proceeding, the truth of the facts which it states, when the witness is dead or cannot be found, or is incapable of giving evidence, or is kept out of the way by the adverse party, or if his presence cannot be obtained without an amount of delay or expense which, under the circumstances of the case, the Court considers unreasonable. The provision of the Order ibid further states that ""provided that the proceeding was between the same party or their representatives-in-interest; that the adverse party in the first proceeding had the right and opportunity to cross-examine. The provision of Article 47 of the Order, 1984 further lays down the condition under which secondary evidence of the testimony of a witness given in former proceeding civil or criminal is rendered admissible in subsequent proceeding, or in a later stage of the same proceeding. It is based on the rule that the best evidence available must always be produced, therefore, previous deposition of the witness and thereafter admissible in subsequent proceeding subject to the requirement/condition of the Order, 1984 
 The statement of Amjad Ali PW-5 (recorded in the previous trial) was transferred in this case under Article 47 of the Order, 1984, due to death of the said witness. The learned counsel for the appellant criticized the statement on the ground that death of PW Amjad Ali was not proved and secondly that previous trial/proceeding, wherein the statement of PW-5 was recorded, was set aside by this Court being nullity in the eyes of law, therefore, previous trial was neither judicial proceeding nor the appellant had been provided opportunity of cross-examination. He placed reliance on the judgments reported in AIR 1944 Lahore 206 and AIR 1945 Calcutta 137. The case laws referred to and relied upon by the learned counsel are distinguished, as in the first case, the witness given up by the prosecution due to illness of that witness, was transferred on record by the Sessions Judge on the request of defence counsel and held that ""there are two criticism to be made on this procedure. In the first place, the learned Sessions Judge should not have admitted in evidence on the sessions record by transferring the statement of Hassan Khan whether at the request of the public prosecutor or of the defence counsel without proof that Hassan Khan was in fact ill and that his presence could not be obtained without necessary inconvenience, expense and delay as laid down in Section 33, Evidence Act"".
 In the second case, it was observed that ""further Section 33, (Section to Article 47) Evidence Act sanctioned the admission of the evidence of an absent witness only on certain specified grounds, which includes inquiry and evidence to establish the inability of the witness of his appearance"".
09.
 In the instant case, the appellant was arrested from Iran, brought to Quetta on 19.02.2007 and thereafter challan to his extent Ex.P/5-B dated 18th November 2008 was submitted after conducting investigation by PW-6 Maqsood Ahmed Inspector (IP) maintain that during, investigation, he came to know that PW Amjad Ali son of Nadir Ali had been died on 24th March 2008 and his death was certified by the Nazim of the area (Ahmed Ali) through B.P/6-A. It appears that challan to the extent of appellant Ex.P/6-B was submitted after conducting investigation by PW-6. This witness was cross-examined to that effect and he replied as under:
10.
 From the above, it appears that certificate Ex.P/6-A, with regard to the death of PW Amjad Ali had not been challenged by the defence nor rebutted through any cogent evidence, therefore, when application for transfer of statement of PW Amjad Ali was allowed by the trial Court on 05th June, 2009, the above evidence regarding death of Amjad Ali was already on record, thus the requirement of Article 47 of the Order, 1984 was proved with regard to death of prosecution witness and the said evidence was also put to the appellant under section 342, Cr.P.C. Whereas the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that previous conviction awarded to the appellant was recorded by the trial Court in his absentia, and this Court in appeal set aside the same, therefore, as per Article 47 of the Order, 1984, the previous trial was not judicial proceeding, is also not tenable. Since section 19(10) of the Act, 1997 empowers the Anti-Terrorism Court to record statement of a person in the absence of the accused, if it is proved, that an accused has absconded and there is no immediate prospect of arresting him, the Court may record deposition of prosecution witness after appointing an Advocate as provided under section 19(11) of the Act, 1997. The statement of PW Amjad Ali was recorded in the previous trial in a judicial proceeding and counsel for pauper accused also cross-examined the said witness, therefore, statement of PW Amjad Ali qualifying the stander embodied in Article 47 of the Order, 1984. In the case of Arbab Tasleem v. The State PLD 2010 SC 642 the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan observed as under:
""As a general rule of evidence only such statement is legal and admissible which is given during the course of judicial proceedings and is on oath and is taken by a person authorized under the law to take down the evidence and that it is made in the presence of the adverse party, giving the right to the adverse party to cross-examine the statement of such deponent.""
11.
 The provisions of Act, 1997 read with Article 47 of the Order, 1984 are an exception and testimony of a witness becomes a legal piece of evidence, therefore, much care and caution be exercised by the Court before placing reliance on it, particularly in case of capital charge. In the instant case, PW Amjad Ali in his testimony recorded on 10th December 2002 before the trial Court stated that on the fateful day, he along with deceased Arif Hussain and Asadullah were in the vehicle of deceased Arif Hussain and when going towards bazar, the appellant along with his co-accused in a Pajero for second time overtook them and stopped in front of them. The appellant and his co-accused got down and while coming towards them started firing upon them. As a result of their firing, he, Asadullah and Arif (deceased) sustained injuries. They were taken to hospital, where he was informed that his cousin Asadullah and friend Arif have succumbed to the injuries. The statement of PW Amjad had further been supported by PW-3 Dr. Muhammad Anwar, who produced death certificate of Muhammad Arif Ex.P/3-A and death certificate of deceased Asadullah Ex.P/3-B, which indicates fire-arm injuries. PW-4 Khaliq Dad further corroborated the testimony of PW Amjad and stated that after receiving information about the incident, he along with SHO and other officials reached at the place of incident. The dead body of Syed Arif and injured Amjad and Asadullah (who later on succumbed to the injuries) were found in a Yellow Taxi bearing registration No.PT-0092. Besides recovery of vehicle, empties, bloodstained pieces of seat cover, the Pajero vehicle bearing registration No. BC-3535 was also taken into possession vide recovery memo. Ex.P/4-H. The inured witness of prosecution i.e. PW Amjad had given a detail account of the incident by attributing role of firing to the appellant and co-accused in respect of fire-arm injuries sustained by him and deceased Syed Arif and Asadullah. Evidence of witnesses were duly supported by medical evidence, recovery of empties, blood-stained clothes of deceased and injured, The injured witness PW Amjad Ali) was worthy of credence, independent natural and trustworthy and there was no lawful reason to discard his testimony, therefore, the testimony of single witness is found entirely reliable. Reference in this respect is placed to the case of Muhammad Mansha v. The State 2001 SCMR 199, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as under:
""A bare perusal would reveal that the language as employed in the said Article 17(1)(b) is free from any ambiguity and no scholarly interpretation is required. The provisions as reproduced hereinabove of the said Article would make it abundant clear that particular number of witnesses shall not be required for the proof of any fact meaning thereby that a fact can be proved only by a single witness ""it is not seldom that a crime has been committed in the presence of only one witness, leaving aside those cases which are not of uncommon occurrence, where determination of guilt depends entirely on circumstantial evidence. If the Legislature were to insist upon plurality witnesses, case where the testimony of a single witness only could be available in proof of the crime, would go unpunished. It is here that the discretion of the Presiding Judge comes into play. The matter thus must depend upon the circumstances of each case and the quality of the evidence of the single witness whose testimony has to be either accepted or rejected. If such a testimony is found by the Court to be entirely reliable, there is no legal impediment to the conviction of the accused person on such proof. Even as the guilt of an accused person may be proved by the testimony of a single witness, the innocence of an accused person may be established on the testimony of a single witness, even though considerable number of witnesses may be forth coming to testify to the truth of the case for the prosecution. The Court is concerned with the quality and not with the quantity of the evidence necessary for proving or disproving a facts. ""
12.
 Whereas the question of quantum of sentence is concerned, the complainant in the FIR has alleged the motive of the incident as a business dispute and threat of dire consequence on the part of accused persons, but PW Amjad Ali during cross-examination admitted that the appellant had no enmity with him or deceased persons. The prosecution has set up a motive, but failed to prove the same. There is no cavil to the proposition that a motive is not a condition precedent to warrant a finding of guilt, however, it has been found by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan to be relevant while considering the question of sentence. In Iftikhar Mehmood v. Qaiser Iftikhar 2011 SCMR 1165, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan did not interfere with the judgment of High Court on the question of sentence and observed as under:
""We agree with the proposition that motive is not sine qua non for the proof of commission of the crime and at the time the motive is not known to any other person other than deceased or accused which never surfaced on record. However, it cannot be denied that motive is always very relevant to determine the quantum of sentence.""
 In Muhammad Yaseen v. The State 2011 SCMR 905, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan partly allowed the appeal and converted the sentence of death into life imprisonment inter alia on the ground that prosecution has failed to prove motive and observed as under:
""The occurrence took place in a broad-daylight on a thoroughfare when Pervaiz lqbal was on his way back to his house after purchasing ice, therefore, the story of substitution propounded by learned counsel for the appellant cannot be accepted. In the absence of any corroboration, the Courts are expected to follow the rule of abundant care and caution in the matter of sentence. It is not denied that no resident of the lane in which the occurrence took place appeared and supported the prosecution story. The prosecution has failed to prove the motive for the offence. The appellant allegedly fired only one shot and decamped from the place of occurrence. The P.Ws. were at a considerable distance from the place where Pervaiz Iqbal was done to death. Therefore, in the above circumstances, we consider it just and proper to convert the sentence of death into imprisonment for life.""
 In view of the above, while maintaining the conviction of the appellant, we partly allow Criminal (A.T.A.) Appeal No. 187 of 2009 and convert the sentence of death into life imprisonment. However, the remaining sentences with regard to the compensation and in default thereof shall remain intact. Benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C. already extended by the trial Court shall remain intact. Consequently, the Murder Reference No. 16 of 2009 is answered in

 JAWAD HASSAN, J.---
 Through the instant Intra Court Appeal the Appellant has challenged the validity of impugned order dated 17.05.2017 passed in Writ Petition No.4634/2016 by the learned Single Judge whereby he dismissed the petition filed by the Appellant.
2.
 Brief facts tersely revealed from this Appeal are that the Appellant filed W.P. No.4634/2016 and made multiple prays to the effect that a writ of certiorari may be issued by declaring that Notification SRO No.1687FT(F&A) dated April, 1956 is ineffective and has expired since 1986 and the lien of the suspension over the land of the Appellant is no more operative and the Respondents may be directed to remove the name of the forest department from the revenue record and further the Respondents may be directed not to interfere in the peaceful ownership and possession of the Appellant over the land, which was dismissed by the learned Single Judge vide the impugned order. Hence, the instant Appeal.
3.
 Learned counsel for the Appellant submitted that the impugned order is liable to be set aside on the grounds that the same is against law and facts; that the learned Single Judge has erred while passing the impugned order that factual controversy is involved in the matter rather the Appellant had raised question of law by submitting that the above referred notification/SRO is ineffective upon the ownership of the Appellant.
4.
 We have heard the arguments of the learned counsel for the Appellant and examined the record available with this Appeal.
5.
 The examination of the impugned order depicts that the same has been passed on the basis of following three grounds:
i.
 Prior to establishing the afore-noted questions no effective relief can be granted to the Petitioner, as the jurisdiction of this Court is meant to enforce the clear legal rights, but not to establish the same from him.
ii.
 The prayers quoted as well as contention raised by the learned counsel for the Petitioner brings the case within the realm of disputed/factual questions, resolution of which require a thorough inquiry, which this Court in exercise of its constitutional jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution cannot undertake.
iii.
 The Petitioner has alternate efficacious remedy available to him by approaching the Civil Court, therefore, jurisdiction of this Court is, even otherwise barred.
6.
 The jurisdiction of this Court has been defined in Article 199 of the Constitution. As per Article 199(1)(c) and (2) of the Constitution, it has been stated that on the application of any aggrieved person, make an order giving such directions to any person or authority, including any Government exercising any power or performing any function in, or in relation to, any territory within the jurisdiction of that Court as may be appropriate for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights conferred by Chapter 1 of Part II.
(2)
 Subject to the Constitution, the right to move a High Court for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights conferred by Chapter 1 of Part II shall not be abridged.
Reliance in this regard is placed on the case titled Asdullah Manzi and others v. Pakistan International Airlines Corporation and others (2005 SCMR 445) wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan held as under:
""The right which is the foundation of an application under Article 199 of the Constitution is a personal and individual right. The legal right may be a statutory right or a right recognized by the law. A person can be said to be aggrieved only when a person is denied a legal right by someone who has a legal duty to perform relating to the right. There must not only be a right but a justifiable right in existence, to give jurisdiction to the High Court in the matter. Unless whatever right, no order can be issued under Art.199.""
It has been further held in the judgment supra that Object of proceedings initiated under Article 199 of the Constitution is the enforcement of a right and not the establishment of legal right and therefore, the right of the incumbent concerned which he seeks to enforce, must not only be clear and complete but simplicitor and there must be an actual infringement of the right.
7.
 Furthermore, the multiple prayers made by the Appellant in the petition, itself shows that certain disputed question of facts are involved in the matter which, under the jurisdiction of this Court, cannot be resolved and the Appellant may adopt appropriate forum/alternate remedy for the determination of the same, as such the learned Single Judge has rightly dismissed the petition of the Appellant on the above referred three grounds and all these grounds have been strengthen by relying upon the judgments of the apex Court. Learned counsel for the Appellant has failed to show any illegality or perversity in the impugned order which has been passed in consonance with the spirit of law and judgment of the apex Court.
8.
 We fully agree with the finding of the learned Single Judge who while relying upon the judgments of the apex Court dismissed the petition being not maintainable. In view of above circumstances, we see no illegality or jurisdictional error in the impugned order which has been passed in line with the dictates of law and does not warrant any interference by this Division Bench.
9.
 Resultantly, the instant Appeal, being bereft of any force, is accordingly dismissed in limine.

 YOUSUF ALI SAYEED, J.---
The instant First Rent Appeal under S.24 of the Cantonments Rent Restriction Act, 1963 (the ""Act"") pertains to the left front portion of Plot No. D-128 Depot Lines, Saghir Hussain Shaheed Road, Karachi, (the ""Subject Premises""), and calls into question the propriety of the Order dated 25.10.2016 (the ""Impugned Order"") made by the learned Additional Controller of Rent, Karachi Cantonment, in Rent Case Number 10 of 2014 (the ""Rent Case""), whereby the defence of the Appellants was struck-off and they were directed to vacate the Subject Premises and hand over peaceful possession thereof to the Respondent within 40 days.
2.
 Briefly, the salient facts leading up to and culminating in the Impugned Order, are as follows:--
(a)
 The Appellants entered into a Tenancy Agreement with the Respondent on 16.11.2012, whereby the Subject Premises, as delineated therein, was taken by them on rent from the Respondent on a monthly rent of Rs.300,000/-.
(b)
 In respect of their obligation to pay rent under the Tenancy Agreement, the Appellants issued 24 postdated cheques to the Respondent, covering the period January 2013 to December 2014.
(c)
 The Respondent instituted the Rent Case, alleging that the Appellants had violated the Tenancy Agreement by raising illegal construction over the Subject Premises and committed default in payment of rent in respect of the months of February and March 2013 and the period May 2013 and beyond and that the post-dated cheques issued in that regard had been dishonoured on presentment.
(d)
 An Application under S.17(8) of the Act was filed by the Respondent seeking a direction as against the Appellants as to payment of the aforementioned arrears of rent as well as payment of future rent. 
(e)
 On 23.12.2014, the learned Rent Controller was pleased to make a tentative rent Order in respect of the Respondent's Application, whereby the Appellants were directed to deposit the arrears of rent amounting to Rs.6,900,000/- on or before 31.12.2014 and to deposit future monthly rent at the rate of Rs.300,000/- before the 5th day of each month.
(f)
 The Appellants failed to comply with the tentative rent Order, and no amount whatsoever was deposited, whether in respect of the arrears or the future period, prompting the filing of an Application under S.17(9) of the Act, and after affording ample opportunity of hearing to the Appellants, the Rent Case eventually came to be disposed of in terms of the Impugned Order, on the terms aforementioned.
3.
 With reference to the Written Statement and the Counter-Affidavit to the Application under S.17(8) filed in the Rent Case, learned counsel for the Appellants contended that Impugned Order was bad in law as the learned Rent Controller had failed to taken into account that there was a dispute pending inter se the Appellants and the Respondent in relation to the Subject Premises in as much as the Appellants had been induced to enter into the Tenancy Agreement on the basis of a representation that the Subject Premises could be put to commercial use, whereas it subsequently transpired that the same was residential in nature. He contended that such misrepresentation constituted a fundamental breach of the Tenancy Agreement on the part of the Respondent, and the Appellant was therefore under no obligation to pay rent thereunder. He further submitted that the Respondent had thus issued instruction to the bank to stop payment of the Cheques. Whilst admitting that no payment had been made towards compliance of the tentative rent Order, learned counsel contended that the said Order ought not to have been passed in view of this dispute, which was the subject of Suit Number 1709 of 2014, for declaration, mandatory and permanent injunction, and compensation of Rs.10 crore, pending before this Court. He prayed that the Impugned Order thus be set aside.
4.
 Learned counsel for the Respondent controverted the aforementioned submissions and contended that the course of action followed by the learned Rent Controller was just and proper, keeping in view the admitted default on the part of the Appellants. He submitted that the Appellants had fabricated a dispute in an endeavour to explain away such default and had thus sought to superimpose the same on the proceedings in the Rent Case albeit the same having no nexus with such proceedings. He pointed out that, even otherwise, the Application filed by the Appellants under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. in Suit Number 1709 of 2014 seeking a restraining order against the Respondent from claiming rent had been dismissed by a learned single Judge of this 
Court vide Order dated 09.01.2015, and submitted that the instant proceedings similarly merited dismissal.
5.
 Having considered the arguments advanced at the bar and examined the record, I am of the view that the failure on the part of the Appellants to comply with the tentative rent Order cannot be condoned on the basis of a dispute as alleged by the Appellants. The Appellant, whilst alleging misrepresentation and unfitness of the Subject Premises for its intended purpose, has nonetheless paradoxically remained in possession thereof, whereas, if they were indeed unable to put the Subject Premises to use, they ought to then have forthwith vacated the same. In my opinion, as long as the Appellants remain liable to pay rent in respect of the Subject Premises to the Respondent for such time as they remain in occupation thereof, and the existence of a dispute, as raised by the Appellant in the aforementioned Suit, would be determined on its own merits in that proceeding, but does not serve to absolve the Appellants of their payment obligation in respect of their continued occupation of the Subject Premises, and the default on their part in perpetuation of such a stance is clearly wilful and contumacious.
6.
 As such, I find no irregularity or illegality in the Impugned Order, and no case for interference stands made out. Accordingly, this Appeal is dismissed.

 IJAZ ANWAR, J.---
Through this petition, the petitioner has called in question his repatriation order dated 9.5.2017 and claimed the following prayer:-
 ""It is therefore humbly prayed that this Hon'ble Court may decide as under:-
A. The Chairman, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is entitled to complete three years of his tenure as provided in section 3(b) in KPK Service Tribunal (Amendment Act, 2013 and in view of Articles 4, 5 of the Constitution and decision of Supreme Court reported as PLD 2013 SC 501 whereby the question of law as involved in the case under consideration has been decided requiring obedience in terms of Article 189 and Article 190 in the Constitution of Pakistan.
B. The impugned order of repatriation dated May 9, 2017 issued by provincial government is unlawful being in conflict with section 3(b) of the above mentioned KPK Service Tribunal (Amendment) Act, 2013.
C. The decision of the Administration Committee of Peshawar High Court referred to the letter issued by the Registrar of Peshawar High Court dated 03.06.2017, being a executive, consultative and administrative authority is subject to judicial review, requiring the findings of the Administration Committee to be brought in consonance with the constitutional provisions laid down in Articles 189 and 190 of Constitution of Pakistan to be read with the judgment of Supreme Court reported as PLD 2013 SC 501.
D. Consequently, the impugned notification of repatriation of petitioner issued by provincial government may be declared as unlawful and ineffective against petitioner and the petitioner may therefore be allowed to complete his tenure of three years since his appointment as the Chairman of the Tribunal, in pursuance of the notification of the appointment issued by the Provincial Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as Annexed A.
2.
 The facts as narrated in this petition are that vide Notification No. SO (E.I) E&AD/9-126/2015 dated January 5, 2015, Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Establishment and Administration Department has appointed the petitioner as Chairman, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Service Tribunal for a period of three years or till attaining the age of Sixty years with effect from 05/01/2015. Through the impugned notification dated 9.5.2017, the Provincial Government has with the consultation of the Hon'ble Chief Justice of Peshawar High Court, repatriated the services of the petitioner. The petitioner claimed to have submitted a letter No.1310-1315/ST, dated 12/05/2017 for the withdrawal of the notification in respect of his repatriation, that was followed by a reminder dated 19.5.2017. The petitioner then submitted a Reference to the Administration Committee of this Court against the same repatriation order, which was regretted by the Administration Committee of this Court, the order was conveyed to him vide letter No.10039/Admn, dated 03/06/2017 communicating the following reasons:-
""While considering the representation against repatriation of Mr. Muhammad Azeem Khan Afridi, Chairman, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Service Tribunal to High Court, the Administration Committee held that the repatriation of judicial officers is the prerogative of Hon'ble the Chief Justice which he has exercised in the case of Mr. Muhammad Azeem Khan Afridi. The Committee endorsed the same and directed that he should report immediately to High Court"".
3.
 The learned counsel for the petitioner was heard in motion. He contended that the appointment of the petitioner as Chairman, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Service Tribunal is a tenure posting and governed under section 3 (b) of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Service Tribunal Act, 1974, where under the petitioner has to complete a period of three years and before completion of the tenure period; the order of repatriation is legally not tenable. The learned counsel for the petitioner argued that by virtue of the reported judgments of the Apex Court PLD 2013 SC 501, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Service Tribunal was given independent status to uphold the separation of judiciary from the executive, thus the laws relating to the establishment of Services Tribunal was amended pursuant to the above judgment of the Apex Court. Learned counsel for the petitioner has also questioned the decision of the Administration Committee of this Court whereby the reason of repatriation has not been disclosed but considered it to be the prerogative of the Hon'ble Chief Justice. He argued that where the law provides posting/appointment for a specific tenure period, the Hon'ble Chief Justice was left with no prerogative. The learned counsel for the petitioner further argued that in view of the latest pronouncement of the Apex Court reported in PLD 2016 SC 961, every such administrative order of the High Court that violate any of the provision of law is questionable before this Court in constitutional jurisdiction.
4.
 To appreciate and consider the arguments of the learned counsel for the petitioner, we may refer to the amended provision of Service Tribunal Act, 1974, whereby appointments of the Chairman are made in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Service Tribunal. This amendment was inserted vide Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Act No.X of 2013. Section 3 is reproduced for convenience:-
3.Tribunal
:--(1) The Governor may, by notification in the official gazette, establish one or more Service Tribunals and, where there are established more than one Tribunal, the Governor shall specify in the notification the class or classes of civil servants in respect of whom or the territorial limits within which, each such Tribunal shall exercise jurisdiction under this Act.
 (2)----
 (3)- A Tribunal shall consist of---
(a)- a Chairman, being a person who [is], has been, or is qualified to be, Judge of High Court; and
(b)- four members, two of whom shall be from amongst District and Sessions Judges and two from amongst the civil servants in BPS-20 and above]
(4)-The Chairman and members of a Tribunal shall be appointed by the Governor in consultation with the Chief Justice of the Peshawar High Court.]
 (5)---
 (6)---
 3A.----
Section 3-B is also reproduced, which relates to tenure and other terms and conditions.
3-B. Tenure, terms and conditions of service of Chairman and members
.---(1) 
The Chairman and a member shall hold office for a period of three years or until he attains the age of sixty years, whichever is earlier, and shall not be eligible for reappointment:
Provided that if a judge of the High Court is appointed as Chairman, he shall hold office for a period of three years or until he attains the age of superannuation as judge of the High Court whichever is earlier.
(2)-In case, a retired judge of the High Court is appointed as Chairman under clause (a) of subsection (3) of section 3, he shall hold office for a period of three years and shall not be eligible for re-appointment.
(3)-The other terms and conditions of service of the Chairman and members shall be such as may be determined by the Governor.
5.
 Admittedly, the petitioner is an officer of the status of District and Sessions Judge (BS-21) and has his seniority amongst other Judicial Officers of the Subordinate Judiciary. It is pertinent to mention here that in the appointment of the Members and Chairman of the Tribunal, the Chief Justice Peshawar High Court has been given the meaningful consultative powers because undue the unamended subsection (4) of section 3 of the Service Tribunal Act, 1974 no such authority was expressly given. The unamended provision was:-
""The Chairman and Members of a Tribunal shall be appointed by the Governor on such terms and conditions as he may determine"".
6.
 It is a matter of record that every appointment on these Ex-cadre posts are considered to be on deputation, because for every such posting, period is required to be specified. Similar is the case of Chairman of the Service Tribunal, who is in fact nominated by the Hon'ble Chief Justice for his appointment for specific period of three years or until he attains the age of Sixty years whichever is earlier. Moreover, the officer while posted under the Provincial Government remained under the administrative powers of the Hon'ble Chief Justice, because for his work and conduct, he remained answerable to the High Court. Though, it has not been specified in the amended section 3B of the Service Tribunal Act, 1974, how to repatriate or cut short the tenure of the Chairman of the Service Tribunal. But the fact remains that the authority, to appoint and to hold the post of Chairman Service Tribunal remains with the Hon'ble Chief Justice, suppose the officer is to be proceeded departmentally for any of his misconduct; the High Court would still wait for the completion of his tenure or to allow him to retire on superannuation. Section 21 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 will come into play, where an authority has the power to appoint an individual he has the power to remove also.
7.
 Apart from this fact, all these Ex-cadre posts are considered as on deputation to the Provincial Government, the main scheme of the concept of deputation is that it is at the consent of lending and borrowing departments and the incumbent of the post have no right, whatsoever, to ask for completion of the tenure or have any right to remain as such. At any time, the lending department can require the services of its officer by repatriating him and similar is the case with borrowing department; they can relieve or spare him as no longer required. 
8.
 The Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has in a number of judgments considered the posting of officers on deputation. In an identical case reported in 2011 SCMR 1688, the Apex Court dismissed the petition filed under Article 184 (3) by a Special Judge whose services were repatriated and who claimed that his tenure posting as Special Judge for three years could not be curtailed by Hon'ble Chief Justice Lahore High Court. The Apex Court refused to interfere in the repatriation of the Special Judge and held as:-
""On the touchstone of the criterion as mentioned herein above, we have examined the question as to whether in this case the provisions as enumerated in Article 184 (3) of the Constitution can be invoked?. The answer would be in negative for the simple reason that for all practical purposes the petitioner is under the administrative control of Lahore High Court Lahore and besides that now he has got no lien against the post of Special Judge Central, Rawalpindi being deputationist and his services have already been repatriated. By no stretch of imagination the learned Lahore High Court Lahore can be directed to refrain from initiation of any disciplinary action as this aspect of the matter exclusively falls within its domain of jurisdiction"".
9.
 In order to appreciate the amended provision of section 3B, it will be necessary to go into the background of the amendment. What we gathered from the relevant paras of the reported judgment PLD 2013 SC 501. The intension of specifying 3 years was because of the fact that previously contract appointments of the Retd. Judges were extended repeatedly from time to time. Thus the Hon'ble Supreme Court restricted that tenure to only 03 years and that too was subjected to the consultation of the respective Chief justice of the Province.
10.
 Mere posting under section 3B of a Chairman for 03-years cannot be considered sacrosanct, and that is subject to modification/curtailment at the exigencies of service.
11.
 The consistent view of the Superior Court on the tenure of the deputationist are that deputationist did not have any vested right to remain on the post for ever or for a stipulated period. The deputationist could be ordered to be repatriated to the parent department at any time without assigning any reason. Similarly, the parent department is not obliged under the law, to assign any reasons for his repatriation. Thus, the Hon'ble Administrative Committee of this Court has rightly regretted the reference of the petition, by holding the repatriation as prerogative of the Hon'ble Chief Justice.
12.
 In expressing the above view, we are fortified by the judgments of the Apex Court reported in 2014 SCMR 799, 822, 2011 SCMR 1688, 2010 SCMR 378 = 618. 
13.
 For the above stated reasons, this petition being misconceived and have no merit, is 
dismissed
 accordingly.

19,"CHINA INTERNATIONAL WATER AND ELECTRIC CORPORATION Versus PAKISTAN WATER AND POWER DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY (WAPDA)","June 12, 2017","KARACHI HIGH COURT SINDH"," Honorable Justice Muhammad Junaid Ghaffar ","2018 CLC 188","JUDGMENT
 MUHAMMAD JUNAID GHAFFAR, J.---
 This is a Suit in respect of an Award passed by the learned Sole Arbitrator dated 23.07.1999 and through this Judgment the objections raised on behalf of Defendant under Sections 30 and 33 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 against the validity of the said Award are being decided.
2.
 Precisely, the facts as stated appear to be that a Tender was floated by Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (Defendant) for the construction of Rato Dero Pump Station (Project), wherein, the bid of China International Water and Electric Corporation (Plaintiff) was accepted. The contract price was Rs.108,668,800/- and the period of contract was 15 months from 28.06.1996 to 28.09.1997. After the Award of the Contract, some dispute arose between the Plaintiff and Defendant and for the present purposes it is only the dispute regarding running Bill No.5 dated 31.01.1997, and therefore, the facts are confined to that extent only. The said running bill was verified by the Engineer on 08.03.1997 but payment was not made within the required period, therefore, the dispute arose. Thereafter the Plaintiff on 04.07.1997 filed an Application under Section 20 of the Arbitration Act, 1940, which was registered as Suit No.875/1997 and the same was decided vide order dated 21.10.1997 and the matter was referred to the learned Sole Arbitrator. Subsequently the Award was passed against which objections were filed by the Plaintiff as well as the Defendant. The said objections were decided by the learned Single Judge of this Court in this Suit vide Judgment dated 01.06.2005 and though the validity of the Award in favour of the Plaintiff was accepted but it was held that the Award was passed on an invalid Reference dated 21.10.1997, therefore, the Arbitrator had no jurisdiction to decide the dispute and pass the Award. The said order was challenged by the Plaintiff through High Court Appeal No.173/2005 and vide Order dated 26.03.2009, the Judgment of the learned Single judge was set-side and the matter was remanded for decision afresh after taking into consideration the objections raised by the Defendant in its Application under Section 30 of the Arbitration Act, 1940. The Defendant being aggrieved preferred a Civil Appeal No.133-K/2009 before the Honourable Supreme Court, which was dismissed vide Order dated 03.09.2012 and the order of Appellate Court was upheld. Under these circumstances, the matter is now before this Court for deciding the objections of the Defendant against the said Award only.
3.
 The learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the Defendant has contended that the Interim Payment Certificate (""IPC"") regarding running Bill No.5 was certified by the Consultant on 08.03.1997 and was delivered on the same date, whereas, the payment was required to be made within 45 days as provided in Conditions of Contract (""COC"") Part-II, Clause 60(5)(a). He has further submitted that such period stood extended for further 60 days in terms of Clause-69(1)(d) of the COC and the consequence thereof is that if the payment is not made within 45+60 days then the Plaintiff was entitled to terminate the contract; but only after giving 14 days prior notice, which per learned Counsel was never issued and considered. He has further contended that for calculation of the period of 45 days and thereafter 60 days, the date of the IPC is to be excluded, however, the learned Sole Arbitrator has not taken into consideration such factual position. According to the Defendant, 45 days expired on 22.04.1997 and thereafter the 60 days' period was to end on 21.06.1997 and 21.06.1997 was a declared local holiday in view of Urs of Hazrat Shah Abdul Lateef Bhitai being 14th Safar and the next date, which is 22.06.1997, was Sunday. Whereas, the cheque dispatched on 20.06.1997 was received by the Plaintiff on 23.06.1997, which was encashed on 24.06.1997, therefore, there was no default on the part of the Defendant. He has further contended that without prejudice to this, the Plaintiff never complied with the terms of COC by issuing a proper legal notice for the alleged termination of the Contract and giving a 14 days' time to the Defendant, and therefore, all such acts done by the Plaintiff including stoppage of work etc. was in violation of the Contract for which the Plaintiff is not entitled for any of the relief(s) so granted in the Award. According to the learned Counsel even if the matter was referred for Arbitration as per the Contract, the work should not have been stopped; rather should have been continued, however the Plaintiff had no intention to carry out the second part of the Contract, which apparently was of less profit percentage, and therefore, they made out this unjustified reason for the alleged termination. Learned Counsel has further contended that the learned Arbitrator has not appreciated the material placed before him including the WAPDA Manual, which provides for the terms of payment and its procedure, whereas, the established practice, whereby, the Plaintiff used to collect their cheques on the due date, has not been considered and rather ignored without any plausible justification. Per learned Counsel it is a settled proposition that while calculating the limitation period first day is to be excluded and for that learned Counsel has also referred to Section 9 of the General Clauses Act, 1897. Learned Counsel has also raised an objection that various payments including damages have been awarded to the Plaintiff by the learned Sole Arbitrator, however, there is no certification to all these payments as required under the Contract, and therefore, non-certification by the Engineer, is in violation of Clause 65(8) of the COC, hence invalid. Per learned Counsel learned Sole Arbitrator while granting various payments, including damages has also failed to consider the material facts as well as the evidence on record and has in fact passed his Award on presumption, which is impermissible in law. In the circumstances, learned Counsel has prayed to set-aside the Award in favour of the Defendant. In support of his contention he has relied upon the cases reported as PLD 1959 Daaca 551 (Dhirendra Nath Datta Roy and others v. Sundhindra Chandra Chakraborti), 2002 CLD 1071 (Shaukat Ali Mian v. Trust Leasing Corporation Ltd. through Chief Executive and 4 others), AIR 1952 Travancore-Cochin 181 (Krishnan Neelakandhan v.

4.
 On the other, learned Counsel for the Plaintiff at the very outset has raised an objection to the effect that this Court is not sitting in Appeal against the Award and is not required to fish latent errors. Per learned Counsel it is only the misconduct of the learned Sole Arbitrator, which can be looked into but even if a different conclusion is to be arrived at, even then, the reasoning of the learned Sole Arbitrator cannot be interfered with. Learned Counsel has contended that in the first round vide Judgment dated 01.06.2005 all the points on merits were upheld in favour of the Plaintiff and there can be no exception to such finding. He has further contended that the first day could not have been excluded as it remained practice between the parties to include the first day while calculating the limitation, and therefore, the last date according to the Plaintiff was 20.06.1997. Whereas, 21.06.1997 was not a Federal Government holiday, therefore, no benefit can be taken by the Defendant, being a Federal Government Entity. Learned Counsel has further contended that since the cheque was not received by 20.06.1997, therefore, in terms of Clause 69(1)(d) of the COC, the Plaintiff was within its rights to terminate the Contract and for such purposes the intimation given to the Defendant was a valid Legal Notice as the same also stands approved by the findings of the learned Sole Arbitrator. Per learned Counsel the Award of the learned Sole Arbitrator has given all the reasoning, and therefore, it is unexceptionable and must not be interfered with. In support of his contention he has relied upon the cases reported as PLD 2011 Supreme Court 506 (Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Food, Islamabad and others v. Messrs Joint Venture Kocks K.G./Rist), PLD 2006 Supreme Court 169 (Mian Corporation through Managing Partner v. Messrs Lever Brothers of Pakistan Ltd. through General Sales Manager, Karachi), PLD 1996 Supreme Court 108 (M/s. Joint Venture KG/Rist through D.P. Giesler G.M.

5.
 I have heard both the learned Counsel and perused the record. First I would like to deal with the objection raised by the learned Counsel for the Plaintiff that this Court cannot set-aside an Award on the ground that a different conclusion can be drawn. To this, I am of the view that there is no cavil and it is settled law that while hearing objections to the Award under Sections 30 and 33 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 this Court does not sit as a Court of appeal nor it is required to undertake reappraisal of evidence recorded by the Arbitrator in order to discover the error or infirmity in the award. However, there is an exception to this rule as well. If the error or infirmity in the award rendering it invalid is appearing on the face of the award and is discoverable by reading the award itself, then the same can be looked into for either setting aside or modifying it. It can also be interfered with in certain exceptional circumstances when the finding of the Arbitrator is not based on the evidence on record Reference may be made to the case reported as Joint Venture KG/Rist v. Federation of Pakistan-PLD 1996 SC 108, Ghee Corporation of Pakistan (Pvt.) Limited v. Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (PLD 1999 Karachi 112) and J.F.C. Gollaher v. Samad Khan (1993 MLD 726).
6.
 In the case of Allah Din & Company v. Trading Corporation of Pakistan (2006 SCMR 614) the Hon'ble Supreme Court has been pleased to observe as under;
.... The learned Division Bench in the impugned judgment had aptly rejected the above claim on the ground that compensation for loss of goodwill or reputation is generally not awarded, particularly in the absence of tangible evidence showing additional loss and further that since the purchaser was already awarded Rs.1 million by the arbitrator as compensation for the anticipated loss of profit further compensation on account of loss of goodwill and reputation was not justified. We find ourselves in agreement with the reasoning of the learned Division Bench. The learned counsel appearing for the purchaser was unable to show any discussion by the arbitrator in the award regarding the loss suffered by the purchaser on account of reputation or goodwill. Apart from a bare claim of the purchaser, the learned counsel could not even refer to any evidence produced by the purchaser before the arbitrator on this issue. The finding of the arbitrator on the issue reproduced above indicates the absence of such evidence as he had awarded compensation on the item simply on the ground that the purchaser was not questioned on behalf of the Food Department on the issue. Such failure by the department does not go to prove the loss caused to the purchaser. It was the burden to the purchaser to have produced independent evidence of the damage caused to his reputation and goodwill on account of non-performance of the contract by the Food Department. Bald statement of the petitioner, without more, that he had suffered loss on this account was not sufficient to establish the claim. In this view of the matter the purchaser was rightly denied damages for loss of goodwill and reputation.
6. 
 The contention of the learned counsel for the purchaser that the Court is not entitled to disagree with the findings of the arbitrator is without force. It is true that the trial Court does not sit in appeal from the finding of the arbitrator but at the same time the Court is empowered to reverse the finding of the arbitrator on any issue if it does not find support from the evidence. The very incorporation of section 26-A of the Arbitration Act requiring the arbitrator to furnish reasons for his finding was to enable the Court to examine the soundness of the reasons. As already held the arbitrator in the case before us had granted damages for loss of reputation and goodwill without there being any evidence to that effect. The Court were, therefore, justified in denying this claim to the purchaser.
7.
 Similarly in the case of IBAD & Co v. Government of Pakistan (PLD 1981 Karachi 236) a learned Single Judge of this Court has been pleased to hold as under;
9.
 The third challenge of learned counsel for the defendant was that it was a case of no evidence. As observed earlier, the contention was that admittedly this was a case of damages but no evidence was adduced by the plaintiffs for proving any damage suffered by them. Counsel, in the circumstances, urged that the record be perused by the Court to determine whether there was evidence before the arbitrator that the plaintiff had suffered the damages which had been awarded by the Arbitrator. To the extent that where there is an allegation that the award is based on no evidence, the Court can, even in a case of non-speaking award, peruse the record including the evidence while considering the objections/application under sections 30 and 33 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 the contention of learned counsel is correct. And if the Court on such perusal finds the award is based on no evidence, will be lawfully exercising jurisdiction in setting aside the award . However, it is also settled law that insufficiency of evidence or that on the evidence adduced before the arbitration the Court would have reached a different conclusion is not a ground for setting aside or interfering with the award. Keeping these principles of mind, I have perused the record of the arbitration proceedings in this case.
8.
 Even otherwise, in this matter the crux of the dispute is regarding interpretation of contract document and the period of limitation as to whether the cheque was issued within time and further that whether issuance of a cheque would amount to making of payment within the period of limitation or not. It further requires to be interpreted that whether the cheque, which was issued within the period of limitation but was encashed thereafter, would amount to discharge of liability within time or not. This is a pure legal question, which has been decided by learned Sole Arbitrator and merely for the fact and reasoning so advanced on behalf of the Plaintiff that ordinarily the Court must not interfere in the Award, which is given on the basis of appraisal of evidence, I am not inclined to agree with it as in my view this case is an exception inasmuch as it is to be looked into that whether inference drawn by the learned Sole Arbitrator is legal or otherwise. In fact this is not a case wherein only on appraisal of evidence some finding of fact is given, which ordinarily is not to be disturbed by the Court while hearing objections to the award; but a case wherein primarily a legal view has been taken by the learned Sole Arbitrator for passing of award in favor of the plaintiff. In such view of the matter, this Court needs to appraise the findings of learned Sole Arbitrator in this regard. Reliance in this regard may be placed on the case of Province of Sindh Waseem Construction Co. (1991 CLC 66) wherein a learned Division Bench of this Court has been pleased to hold that when the provisions of a contract document have not been properly appreciated by the Arbitrator, then it is a case of an error apparent on the face of the award, and therefore, can be interfered with.
9.
 Though the facts have already been stated hereinabove; but for recapitulating, the dispute appears to be in respect IPC No.5, which was certified by the Engineer on 08.03.1997. The period of 45 days after excluding 08.03.1997 would have ended on 22.04.1997 and further grace period of 60 days again excluding 22.04.1997 would have ended on 21.06.1997. Whereas, if 08.03.1997 is included then the period of 45 days would have ended on 21.04.1997 and similarly the period of 60 days if 22.04.1997 is included would have ended on 20.06.1997. The learned Sole Arbitrator had framed the following consent Issues available at Page-7:-
(I)
 Whether the statement of claim was filed in these proceedings is covered by the reference made to the Sole Arbitrator and if so to what extent?
(II)
 Whether the statement of claim as filed is maintainable particularly in view of clause 67 of the COC and if so to what extent?
(III)
 Whether the claimants were justified in invoking clause 69 of the COC and if so to what extent and effect?
(IV)
 Whether the claimants notice dated 21st June 1997 terminating the contract R.T.D-1 is contractually valid under the provision of clause 69(1) of COC?
(IV)-(V) Whether the claimants are entitled to the sum of Rs.8,48,79,270/- as damages or any other amount due under the contract?
(V)
 What the Award should be?
10.
 Insofar as Issues Nos. I and II are concerned no further deliberation is required inasmuch on the basis of Order dated 26.3.2009 passed in HCA No.173/2005 in the first round of litigation, it is only the objections of the Defendant, which are to be dealt with and decided; and therefore, both these Issues need not be discussed and decided.
11.
 Insofar as Issues Nos. III and IV are concerned these Issues are crucial Issues and if the answer to these Issues is given in favour of the Defendant then there would be no need to give any finding on Issues Nos.V and VI. As discussed hereinabove, the opinion through this Judgment revolves around above Issues Nos.III and IV and precisely it is to the effect that whether the first day is to be included or not; and secondly whether the Plaintiff was justified in terminating the Contract. Insofar as Issues Nos.III and IV are concerned the relevant finding of the learned Sole Arbitrator is as under:-
""20.
 On the interpretation of clauses 60 and 69 COC, both the parties seem to be of the same view. The only difference is about the method of computation of the period. Clause 60(l)(a) provides that the Engineer can approve or amend the AIP and when the Engineer has determined the amount due to the contractor he shall issue to the employer and the contractor a certificate called Interim Payment Certificate certifying amount due to the contractor therefore on certification the amount becomes due to the contractor. Such interim payment certificates are proof of the amount due as certified by the Engineer. In sub-clause 5(a) payment is to be made within 45 days of such certificate being delivered to the employer. Under clause 69 as amended by Part II if the employer fails to pay the amount due under any certificate of the Engineer within 60 days after the same shall have become due under the terms of the contract the contractor shall be entitled to terminate his employment under the contract after giving 14 days prior notice to the employer.
21.
 The next question is whether the payment through cheque was made within the situated time. Admittedly the payment has been made through cheque dated 20th June, 1997. The Learned Counsel for the claimants has referred to the meaning of the word payment as defined in (I). the Lexicon by P. Ramanath Aiyar 1997 edition as discharge of an obligation by delivery of money or its equivalent and is generally made with the assent of both parties to the contract (2). In Black Law dictionary, it has been defined as ""In a more restricted legal sense, payment is the performance of the duty, promise or obligation or discharge of a debtor liability by the delivery of money."" (3) In Ballantine's Law Dictionary ""payment of cheque has been defined as: 
""The act of the drawee bank in handing over money the amount in which the cheque is drawn, to a payee or endorse .... accepted unconditionally by the payee or endorsee.""
Reference has also been made to Negotiable Instrument Act by Bhashayam and Adiga (1997 Ed) Pagits Law of Banking (10th Ed) and AIR 1994 Cal. 459 (Borojender Coomar Banerji v. Shrish Chandra Chterjee).
Relying on these definitions the Learned Counsel for the claimants has contended that as the cheque deposited in the account of the claimants which was credited on 24th June 1997 this should be treated as the date of payment. The Learned Counsel for the respondents contended that the date when the cheque was issued should be the date of payment. Reliance has been made on M/s. Mahmood Ahmed v. M. A. Marker, PLD 1983 Quetta 36. In this judgment reliance has been placed on Sarfraz Khan's case PLD 1969 Karachi 176 and Peoples Sheet Mills, PLD 1991 Karachi 379. All the referred judgments are under the provisions of West Pakistan Urban Rent Restriction Ordinance. It was observed that cheque received by landlord on dates mentioned on cheque the date of payment of rent shall be deemed to be made on such date (as mentioned on the cheque). In Sarfraz Khan's case it was observed that if the deposit is made in the Controller office by cheque and payment on the cheque is received by the Controller then the tenant cannot be deemed to be in default unless the deposit of cheque itself was made after expiry of the date prescribed in the Controller's orders. Therefore it is the date of deposit of cheque which is relevant for determining the date of payment. In the present case the date on which cheque was received by the claimants should be the date for payment provided it has been deposited and encashed the next day. The date of cheque itself may not be treated as date for payment of the cheque. In this regard I would refer to a very exhaustive judgment of the Supreme Court of India -- Renu Sagar Power Company v. General Electric Company and another AIR 1985 SC 1156. It was observed that the bill or promissory note can never go in the discharge of debts unless it is a part of the contract that it should be so. In this regard reference was made to Negotiable Instruments Act, by Beshayam and Adiga 14th Edition where principle has been summarized that:-
""It is always a question of intention of parties whether a bill or promissory note or cheque taken on account of a debt, operates as an absolute discharge of the debts, or only as conditional payment of it. Generally speaking a bill or note can never go in discharge of a debt un less it is a part of the contract that it should be so, for, a mere promise to pay, cannot be regarded as an effective payment. This rule may also be based on a general principle of law that one simply executor contract does not ordinarily extinguish another, the presumption in such cases is that the bill or promissory note is taken only as a conditional payment.""
Reference can also be made to Commissioner of Income Tax v. Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga AIR 1933 PC 108 where it was observed that, ""a debtor who gives his creditor a promissory note for the sum he owes can in no sense be said to pay his creditor, he merely gives him a document of voucher of debt possessing certain legal attributes. In Keshar Mill Co. Limited v. Commissioner of Income Tax AIR 1950 Bombay 166 where cheques and Hundis were issued in payment of price for goods sold and delivered, the question arose whether such cheques amounted to payment resulting unconditional discharge of liability to pay the price. Chagla Chief Justice observed, ""now I should have thought that ordinarily the payment of debt by cheque never results in the discharge of the debtor. A cheque merely represents an order by the drawer of the cheque to his banker to pay the amount to the person named in the cheque and till that payment is made, the debt is not discharged. Therefore, the sending of the cheque as it said before ordinarily is not unconditional discharge of the liability."" It was further observed that there may be arrangement between a creditor and a debtor that the receipt of a cheque or hundi not being honoured the creditor would have no right to sue on the original cause of action but only on the cheque or hundi."" Apply these principles to the facts of the case, I find that there was no such arrangement between parties that issuance, dispatch or receipt of cheque would amount to payment. Since cheque was received on 23rd June 1977 which was honoured on 24th June 1997 payment shall be deemed to have been made on 24th June 1997. In view of the above discussion the respondent have failed to pay AIP 5 within the time stipulated by the contract. The claimants were entitled to invoke clause 69 and seek remedies provided therein. The notice dated 21.6.1997 was valid.""
12.
 The learned Sole Arbitrator has come to the conclusion that the first date was to be included, and therefore, the last date of payment of IPC No.5 was 20.06.1997, whereas, though the cheque was issued on 20.06.1997 but the same was received on 23.06.1997 and was encashed on the next date i.e. 24.06.1997, and therefore, admittedly there was a default on the part of the Defendant. After coming to this conclusion, the learned Sole Arbitrator has further held that the Notice dated 21.06.1997 was a valid Legal Notice in terms of COC. In coming to this conclusion i.e. to include the first day as well as to hold that the payment made through a cheque is only valid when the cheque is encashed and not from the date of issuance of cheque, reliance has been placed on three Judgments from the Indian jurisdiction i.e. AIR 1985 Supreme Court 1156 (Renusagar Power Co. Ltd., v. General Electric Company and another) AIR 1933 PC 108 (Commissioner of Income-tax Behar and Orissa v. Kameshwar Singh of Darblianga) and AIR 1950 Bombay 166 (Keshav Mills Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay Mofussil). With respect I may observe that none of these three Judgments have any relevant facts as compared to instant matter. The Judgment in the case of Reno Power Sagar Power Cornty (supra) has perhaps been wrongly cited in this matter as it relates to the Foreign Arbitration Award and perhaps to my understanding has not dealt with the controversy regarding validity of the payment from the date of cheque or its encashment. The other two judgments have also dealt with altogether different set of facts regarding the levy of Income Tax and the inclusion of the payment or Promissory Note received in lieu of a debt. I may observe that the accounting systems vary from an Assessee to Assessee, whereas, even otherwise they are of no relevance inasmuch as Income Tax Law at the relevant time has not been discussed by the learned Sole Arbitrator viz-a-viz the terms of Contract between the parties. The relevant portion in the Conditions of the Contract was stipulated in Clause-60(5) of Conditions of Contract Part-II, which reads as under:-
 
""Interim Payment Certificates
60. (1) (a) The Contractor Shall submit .
(b)
(c)
 .
 
""Materials for the Permanent Works

(5) (a) Payment to the Contractor of the amount due under each of Interim Payment Certificate issued by Engineer shall be made by the Employer within 45 days of such certificate being delivered to the Employer.
(b)
 In the event of nonpayment within the said period, interest shall accrue to the Contractor at a rate of ten percent per annum upon all sums unpaid from the date upon which the same should have been paid.""
""69. (1) In the event of the Employer:
(a)
 failing to pay to the Contractor the amount due under any certificate of the Engineer within thirty days after the same shall have become due under the terms of the Contract, subject to any deduction that the Employer is entitled to make under the Contract, or
(b)
 Interfering with or obstructing or refusing any required approval to the issue of any such certificate, or
(c)
 becoming bankrupt or, being a company, going into liquidation, other than for the purpose of a scheme of reconstruction or amalgamation, or
(d)
 giving formal notice to the Contractor that for unforeseen reasons, due to economic dislocation, it is impossible for him to continue to meet his contractual obligations the Contractor shall be entitled to terminate his employment under the Contract after giving fourteen days prior written notice to the Employer, with a copy to the Engineer.""
13.
 Clause-60(5)(a) provides that payment to the Contractor of the amount under each of the IPC's duly issued by the Engineer shall be made by the Employer (Defendant) within 45 days of such Certificate being delivered to the Employer, whereas sub-clause (b) provides for accrual of interest to the Contractor, at the rate of 10%. Similarly Clause-69 of COC deals with default of Employer (Defendant) and it provides that in the event of the Employer failing to pay to the Contractor the amount due under any Certificate of the Engineer within 30 days (admittedly extended to 60 days), after the same shall have become due under the terms of the Contract subject to any deduction that the Employer is entitled to make under the Contract; and Clause (d) thereof provides that the Contractor shall be entitled to terminate his employment under the Contract after giving 14 days prior notice to the Employer with a copy to the Engineer. In nutshell, the first part i.e. Clause-60 provides a period of 45 days after issuance of IPC, and the same stands extended to a further 60 days and there appears to be no dispute that the total number of days is 105 in the aggregate. The only question is that how the word ""within"" is to be interpreted i.e. whether the date on which IPC was delivered is to be included or excluded. In the case of M/s. Shahi Textile (supra) a learned Division Bench of this Court had the occasion to interpret more or less similar and analogous provision as contained in Section 10(2) of the Financial Institutions (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance, 2001, which reads as under:-
""The defendant shall file the application for leave to defend within thirty days of the date of first service by any one of the modes laid down in subsection (5) of section 9....""
14.
 The aforesaid provision provides that the Defendant shall file the application for leave to defend within 30 days of the date of first service by any one of the modes laid down in Subsection (5) of Section 9 of FIO, 2001. The case before the learned Division Bench was to the effect that how this 30 days period is to be calculated or counted and whether or not the date of service would be included or excluded in counting the limitation. The terms of the contract in this matter between the parties is more or less on the same footing, and therefore, I am of the considered view that the interpretation arrived at by the learned Division Bench in the aforesaid case squarely applies to this case as well. The learned Division Bench also had the occasion of taking assistance from Section 9 of the General Clauses Act 1897. The relevant finding of the learned Division Bench is as under:-
As is clear from the foregoing, whenever the word ""from"" is used, the first day has to be excluded. This does not however mean that if the word ""from"" is not used; the first day has to be included. It is to be noted that there is no requirement under the General Clauses Act that the use of the word ""of"" would cause the first day to be included. Whether or not the first day is to be included or excluded would therefore depend on the statutory provisions and the context in which they appear. On a consideration of the 2001 Ordinance, we are of the view that the correct interpretation of section 10(2) is that the day on which the summons is served is to be excluded. As correctly pointed out by learned counsel for the appellants, the summons must be in a specific form, and that form uses the word ""from"". The requirement that the summons be in the form specified is expressly stated in section 9(5). Thus, section 10(2) becomes applicable if and only if, service is affected by a summons in the form prescribed by section 9(5), and in one of the modes specified in that provision. It would in our view, be most inequitable to serve a summons on the defendant which informs him that he may file his leave to defend application within 30 days ""from"" service, and then compute the period of limitation on a basis that includes the day of service. A conjoint reading of these provisions therefore leads to the conclusion that the day of service of summons should be excluded from consideration. Secondly, and more generally, ""a court ought not to put such an interpretation upon a statute of limitation by implication and inference as may have a penalizing effect unless the court is forced to do so by irresistible force of the language used""; Makhanlal Roy Pramanick and others v. Pramathanath Basu and others AIR 1953 Cal. 50, 52. In our view, this principle can be usefully applied to the present situation. There is nothing expressly stated in section 10(2) that would require the inclusion of the day of service while computing the period of limitation, and inasmuch as such inclusion can have a penalizing effect by debarring the defendant from appearing in the suit, the preferable interpretation would be that the day of service should be excluded. Unless the relevant statutory language is clear, and admits to only one meaning, provisions relating to limitation should be construed in favour of preserving the rights of parties, whether that be the right of a plaintiff to sue or the right of a defendant to appear in the suit and defend himself. There is nothing in section 10(2) that points in one direction alone. Accordingly, the proper interpretation of this provision is as noted above.
7.
 We therefore conclude, with respect, that even under the 2001 Ordinance, the day of service of summons (through whichever mode is first effective) is to be excluded from consideration. On that basis, since summons in the present case was served through publication on 27-1-2010, the last day of limitation was 26-2-2010. That day was admittedly a holiday, and the first working day thereafter was 1-3-2010 on which date the leave to defend application was, filed. Accordingly, it was within time, and the learned single Judge, with respect, erred materially in coming to the contrary conclusion. The leave to defend application ought therefore to have been heard and decided on its merits. Since this had not been done, the appeal had to be allowed and the matter remanded to the learned single Judge in terms as stated in our short order.
15.
 There is another provision, which is more or less similar in nature as provided in the Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979 i.e. Section 10 under the head ""Payment of Rent"". This provision has been interpreted by various decisions of this Court as well as by the Honourable Supreme Court. In my view the same is also relevant to adjudicate the controversy in hand. Section 10 of SRPO, 1979 reads as under:-
""S.10 
Payment of rent
.--- (1) The rent shall, in the absence of any date fixed in this behalf by mutual agreement between the landlord and tenant, be paid not later than the tenth of the month next following the month for which it is due.
(2)
 The rent shall, as far as may be, be paid to the landlord, who shall acknowledge receipt thereof in writing.
(3)
 Where the landlord has refused or avoided to accept the rent, it may be sent to him by postal money order, be deposited with the Controller within whose jurisdiction the premises is situate.
(4)
 The written acknowledgement, postal money order receipt or receipt of the Controller, as the case may be shall be produced and accepted in proof of the payment of the rent:
Provided that nothing contained in this section shall apply in the case pending before the Controllers on the commencement of this Ordinance.""
16.
 Though apparently one could say that there is no exact similarity of words in the aforesaid provisions under the SRPO, 1979 viz-a-viz the provisions of the Contract in dispute. However, since in this matter there is also one issue that as to whether a payment would be deemed to be made within time, if a cheque is issued within the limitation period or on the date on which the limitation expires and whether such tender of payment through a cheque would result in default or not. There is a series of judgments that in the context of Section 10 of SRPO, 1979, the tender of payment through a cheque on the last date as provided therein would amount to a payment within due date irrespective of the fact that it was encashed subsequently after such date had expired. If any authority is needed, one may refer to the cases of (Messrs Mahmood Ahmad & sons v. M.A. Marker) reported in PLD 1983 Quetta 36, (Sarfaraz Khan v. Muhammad Abdul Rauf) reported in PLD 1969 Karachi 176 and (Messrs Peoples Steel Mills Ltd., Karachi v. Hafizuddin and 7 others) reported in PLD 1981 Karachi 739.
17.
 In the case of Muhammad Aslam and another v. Muhammad Amin (1996 SCMR 1646), the Honourable Supreme Court had the occasion to compute the period of 60 days and while doing so the date from which it was to be computed was excluded. The relevant finding reads as under:-
""4.
 We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and have also gone through the cases cited in the impugned judgment of the High Court which fully support the view taken by the learned Single Judge. In all these cases, it has been held that the principle embodied in section 9 of General Clauses Act and section 12(1) of Limitation Act namely, the date from which the period prescribed is reckoned is to be excluded, is a principle of equity which should generally be applied for interpreting/ construing the decrees and orders of the Courts. Section 9 of General Clauses Act in its relevant aspect provides ""In any Central Act -----, it shall be sufficient, for the purpose of excluding the first in a series of days or any other period of time, to use the word 'from' ------"". This provision came up for consideration in Puran Chand v. Muhammad Din and others (AIR 1935 Lahore 291) wherein it was held by a Division Bench of Lahore High Court that General Clauses Act embodies a principle of equity which should be applied to decrees apart from Statutes and that the date from which the period specified in the decree was to be reckoned should be excluded. Again in Ramchandra Govind Unavne v. Laxman Savleram Ronghe (AIR 1938 Bombay 447), the Bombay High Court while construing a decree, dated 23rd January, 1936 directing the defendant to pay Rs.200 ""within fifteen days frog, this day"" held that if these words occurred in a statute, the first day would be excluded by virtue of section 9 of General Clauses Act and the fifteenth day would expire on 7th February. It was further observed that section 9 would not apply in terms as the words did not occur in a statute ""but it is desirable for the sake of uniformity that the same interpretation should be given to an expression occurring in a judicial order as would be given to it in a statute, and I think, therefore, the expression 'fifteen days' would mean fifteen clear days; and that the date of making the order should be excluded"". Similar view was taken by Dacca High Court in the case of Abdus Sattar and others v. Abdul Khaliq and others (1971 DLC 239) wherein it was held that from a bare reading of the provisions of section 9 of the General Clauses Act and section 12(1) of the Limitation Act; it appeared that in computing the period prescribed in any order passed by' the Court, ""the date on which the order was passed shall have to be excluded. It was also observed that there have been a series of decisions for the view that the equitable principle contained in section 9 of General Clauses Act should ordinarily be applied to the construction of decrees and orders passed by the Courts unless there is something repugnant in the subject or context. Support for the view that in computing the period mentioned in the order, the date of. The order should be excluded was also drawn from Halsbury's Law of England 2nd Edition, Volume 32, p.138 which is reproduced hereunder:-
""When a period of time running from a given day or event to another day or event is prescribed by law or, fixed by contract and the question arises whether their computation is to be made inclusively or exclusively of the first mentioned or of the last mentioned day, regard must be had to the context and the purpose for which the computation has to be made. Where there is room for doubt, the enactment or instrument ought to be so construed as to effectuate and not to defeat the intention of Parliament or of the parties, as the case may be, expression such as ' from such a day' or 'until such a day' are equivocal since they do not make it clear whether the inclusion or the exclusion of the day named may be intended. As a general rule however, the effect of defining a period in such a manner is to exclude the first day and to include in the last day. Both days must be included if the word 'inclusive' is added.""
Peshawar High Court in the case of Sher Muhammad and 6 others v. Gulfraz (1989 CLC 1344) also affirmed the aforenoted view. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioners was unable to cite any decision to the contrary nor did he dispute the factual position that if 8th of March, 1993 was excluded from computation of sixty days period, the deposit made on 8th May would be within time as 7th May happened to be Friday. He, however, sought to contend that the equatable principle relied upon by the learned Judge in the High Court could not justifiably be invoked in the instant case so as to exclude 8th of March because it was decided with the agreement of the parties that the period of sixty days would commence from the said date. This contention is not borne out from the proceedings recorded and the order passed by the Court on 7-3-1993 which shows that it was directed/clarified by the Court that the period of sixty days would commence from 8-3-1993. In any case, it was a part of the Court's order/decree. The learned Judge in the High Court was, therefore, right in holding that while computing the period of sixty days, 8th of March must be excluded in view of the settled legal position aforenoted.
5.
 Upshot of the above discussion is that there is no merit in these petitions, which are accordingly dismissed and the leave sought is refused.""
19.(sic) In the case of (Messrs Mahmood Ahmad & Sons v. M.A. Marker) reported as PLD 1983 Quetta 36, the relevant finding reads as under:-
""6.
 The next question which falls for determination is whether the rent had been paid on the specified date as mentioned in the order of Controller? The learned counsel for the respondent has stated that the payment would be considered from the date of receipts. It has not been disputed by the respondent that the cheques were delivered to the respondent on the dates mentioned in the cheques. If we accept the dates of the cheques, then the rent for the months of June, 1977 was paid in time. Similarly the rent for the month of April and May, 1980 had been paid in time. The payments would be considered from the date of cheque as held in Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay v. Messrs Ogal Glass Works Ltd. (AIR 1954 SC 429) it has been observed:-
""The position, therefore, is that in view of the matter there was, in the circumstances of this case, an implied agreement under which the cheques were accepted unconditionally as payment and on another view, even if the cheques were taken conditionally, the cheques not having been dishonoured but having been cashed the payment related back to the dates of receipt of the cheques and in law the dates of payments were the dates of the delivery of the cheques.""
20.
 In the case of (Messrs Peoples Steel Mills Ltd., Karachi v. Hafizuddin and 7 others) reported as PLD 1981 Karachi 739, the relevant finding reads as under:-
""This Ordinance does allow payment of rent by cheque as between landlord and tenant as stated above but does not Disallow such mode of payment under section 13(6). In these, circumstances it can be said that in compliance of the tentative rent order if the payment of rent is made by the tenant by way of cheque and that is accepted and the cheque is honoured and no objection is raised then it is valid tender otherwise if the cheque is dishonoured or objection is raised to such mode of payment then the tender will not be considered as valid and the tenant will be liable for default. Presentation of cheque may be considered a valid payment in contractual liability but not in statutory liability as contemplated under section 13(6) of the Ordinance.""
21.
 In the case of (Sarfaraz Khan v. Muhammad Abdul Rauf) reported as PLD 1969 Karachi 176, the relevant finding reads as under:-
""The rule that tender should be in current coins or in currency notes rests on the old English decisions which were given at the time when tender of cheques was not the popular or universally recognised mode for discharge of liabilities. It will be noted, however, that with the passage of time, the Courts, both in England as well as in this sub-continent, evolved important exceptions to this rule. The question is, whether there is no scope to evolve any further exception to the rule now when it has become an established and universally recognised practice to discharge liabilities by tender of cheques. In my opinion, in the context of the modern conditions, it will be reasonable to hold that tender of cheque is a valid tender, unless the creditor expressly objects to such tender, or unless there is an express provision in the arrangement between the creditor and the debtor that the latter should discharge his liability only by tender of money in current coins or currency notes issued under the authority of some statute. In adopting this rule, I would venture to say that I am not departing from the rules which have been laid down from time to time by the Courts in England and in this sub-continent on the point under consideration. I feel that I am only extending the scope of the exceptions, which have been established by judicial consensus, to the present day conditions. If this view is taken of the question, then tender by the appellant of the arrears of rent and of the rent for August 1964, by cheque cannot be rejected as invalid tender, because it has not been shown that the landlord, in his dealings with the appellant, ever raised any express objection to payment of rent by cheque, nor has it been shown that the agreement between the parties required that tender of rent should be only in current coins or currency notes.
7.
 In the instant case, the question which really arises for decision is not whether the appellant made a legal tender of the arrears of rent due from, but whether the appellant made default in complying with the order of the Controller made under section 13(6) of the West Pakistan Urban Rent Restriction Ordinance, 1959. In my view, if deposit is made in the Controller's office by cheque and payment on this cheque is received by the Controller, then the tenant cannot be deemed to be in default, unless the deposit of the cheque itself was made B after the expiry of the date prescribed in the Controller's order. This, I would venture to say, would be a correct and sensible approach to the question of valid or invalid payments of rent and arrears to the landlord or to the Controller under section 13(6) of the aforesaid Ordinance.""
22. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Ibrahim Trust. Karachi v. Shaheen Freight Services (PLD 2011 SC 331), had the occasion to examine a somewhat similar provision under the SRPO, 1979 and so also the orders of the learned Rent Controller who had directed the tenant to deposit further monthly rent of every month on or before 10th of each calendar month. The precise question was to the effect that whether the order would stand complied with if Pay Order of the rent is furnished to the Court on 10th or on the date when such Pay Order is actually released and credited in the account of the landlord. The relevant observations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court are as under:-
""10.
 We may also observe here that although there is no ambiguity to this legal position, but even if for argument sake, we examine the question of default qua striking off the defence of a tenant on the premises as claimed by the appellant, firstly, when two equally logical interpretations of a rent order, entailing penal consequences were possible, as may be in the instant case, then the one favourable to the subject was to be given preference i.e. no contemplation for payment of any advance rent was to be deduced from the language of such rent order to the prejudice of tenants, secondly, as rightly held by learned Single Judge in Chambers of the High Court of Sindh in his impugned judgment dated 19-2-2010, deposit of pay orders in the Bank on the 10th of each month, under valid challans issued by the Nazarat office was due compliance of the rent orders by the tenants, irrespective of the fact when payment of such pay orders was collected or realized from the concerned Bank by its encashment.""
23. Similarly in the case reported as Khursheed Begum and others v. Inam-ur-Rehman Khan and others (PLD 2009 Lahore 552), a learned Division Bench of Lahore High Court had the occasion to examine a situation that as to whether a payment made through a cheque could be treated as a valid payment on issuance of such cheque within the contemplation of Order XXI, Rule 84, C.P.C. The relevant observations are as under:-
19.
 About the question raised by the Court auctioneer that the payment of 1/4 amount on the date of the auction could be received by him through cheque, though this has not been controverted by Mr. Kazmi, however, it may be held according to Order XXI, Rule 84, C.P.C. ""On every sale of immovable property the person declared to be the purchaser shall pay immediately after such declaration a deposit of twenty-five per cent, on the amount of his purchase-money to the officer or other person conducting the sale and in default of such deposit, the property shall forthwith be re-sold."" Thus it is mandatory provision that 1/4th should be deposited with the Court auctioneer and if not he is bound to re-sell the property forthwith; this conforms to the spirit of the law that quite steps and legal formalities are undertaken before the auction is conducted and if the successful bidder runs away and the auction remains unsuccessful on that count, again all the legal niceties have to be followed, which shall be an abuse of the process of law and the chance of re-sale there and then shall be gone and frustrated; it is in the above context that the law envisages a cash payment and even m otherwise when the law (the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908) was enforced, the banking system as it is today, was not in place, therefore, the payment through cheque could not be conceived, however, because of the change circumstances, now a days it is a real risk and peril to carry huge money, thus the payment through cheques can be read into the provision as this shall not militate against the spirit of Order XXI, Rule 84, C.P.C, but the successful bidder along with the cheque should also establish by providing the latest Bank statement to the Court auctioneer that he has the requisite funds in the account from where the cheque is issued and if it is otherwise, the Court auctioneer in the light of the command of law should re-sell the property forthwith, otherwise the law for the resale shall be infringed; besides the consequences of Order XXI, Rule 71, C.P.C. shall get waste and frustrated.
24.
 In the case reported as K. Saraswathy alias K. Kalpana v. P.S.S. Somasundaram Chettiar (1990 MLD 413), the Honorable Supreme Court of India had the occasion to examine the deposit of amount in Court on certain directions, through cheque, and it was held that tender of cheque on the last day stipulated in the order of the Court, realized subsequently, would be a valid payment within time. The relevant observation reads as under;
5.
 It is contended before us on behalf of the appellant that the cheque for Rs.6,02,000 was tendered in Court on 29th May, 1980 and that it was duly honoured by the Bank and money was realised under the cheque, and therefore it must be taken that payment had been effected by the appellant on 29th May, 1980 within the time stipulated by this Court in its order dated 29th November, 1979. In Commr. of Income-tax, Bombay South, Bombay v. Ogale Glass Works Ltd. Ogale Wadi, AIR 1954 SC 429 it was laid down by this Court that payment by cheque realised subsequently on the cheque being honoured and encashed relates back to the date of the receipt of the cheque, and in law the date of payment is the date of delivery of the cheque. Payment by cheque is an ordinary incident of present day life, whether commercial or private, and unless it is specifically mentioned that payment must be in cash there is no reason why payment by cheque should not be taken to be due payment if the cheque is subsequently encashed in the ordinary course. There is nothing in the order of this Court providing that the deposit by the appellant was to be in cash. The terms of the order dated 29th November, 1979 are conclusive in this respect and it is the intent of that order which will determine whether payment by cheque within the period stipulated in that order was excluded as a mode in satisfaction of the terms of that order. The time for payment is governed by the order of this Court.
6.
 It is alleged on behalf of the respondent that there was no money on the date of delivery of the cheque to support payment of it and that it was subsequently when arrangements were made that the cheque was realised. Now, the High Court has not found that if the cheque was presented for encashment on the date it was delivered the cheque would not have been encashed. There is nothing to suggest also that the cheque was not honoured in due course and that the Bank had at any time declined to honour it for want of funds in the ordinary course. In any event, there is nothing to suggest that, under the arrangements made for payment of the cheque, even if it had been encashed on the date it was delivered the cheque would not have been encashed. There is no finding by the High Court that on 29th May, 1980 the cheque would not have been realised. That being so, the question whether the appellant had wrongly stated that her counsel had offered to pay cash to the High Court office on 29th May, 1980 ceases to be relevant. We also see no substance in the objection taken before the High Court that in the letter dated 29th May, 1980 addressed by counsel for the appellant forwarding the cheque for Rs.6,02,000 there was a request for the return of the cheque in case it was found that the appellant was entitled to the set-off claimed by her. The application of the appellant claiming adjustment was pending in Court, and no conclusion can be drawn against her on the ground that she had requested a return of the cheque in the event of the adjustment being allowed by the Court.
7.
 We are of the view that the conditions set forth in the order of this Court dated 29th November, 1979 in the facts and the circumstances of the case have been complied with by the appellant substantially and she is entitled to the benefit of that order.
25.
 The upshot of the above discussion is that the last date for payment of IPC No.5 duly certified by the Engineer on 8.3.1997 was 21.6.1997 and not 20.6.1997 as concluded by the learned Arbitrator. The 1st day i.e. 8.3.1997 is not to be included but is to be excluded for calculation of the total period of payment (45+60=105 days), and therefore, the payment could have been made by 21.6.1997, whereas, admittedly the cheque was duly issued on 20.6.1997 (the question of its delivery now being academic in view of the above discussion). The said cheque was accepted and encashed by the Plaintiff on 24.6.1997 without any obstacle and or delay by the Bank, therefore in view of the above discussion and precedents of various Courts, the date of payment will be deemed to be 20.6.1997 on which date the cheque was issued and was subsequently encashed. Therefore, there was no default on the part of Defendant in payment of IPC-5, and plaintiff had no cause of action to invoke or exercise the option of termination of Contract in terms of clauses 60 and 69 of COC. Since I have come to a definite conclusion that payment made was within the period specified in the contract, therefore, there is no need to give any finding with regard to the issue that whether the notice issued by the plaintiff duly fulfilled the conditions of the contract or not. Accordingly the entire claim lodged on the basis of such alleged default falls on ground as the contract could not have been terminated for such alleged default; consequently no damages as claimed could have been granted or even considered. This conclusion responds to Issue Nos. III and IV, whereas, in view of this conclusion no further discussion is required in respect of remaining Issues. Accordingly the objection raised by the defendant under sections 30 and 33 of the Arbitration Act, 1940, are sustained and the impugned Award dated 23.07.199 is hereby set aside.
26.
 Award is hereby set aside.

 JAWAD HASSAN, J.---
Through the instant Intra Court Appeal the Appellants have called in question the legality of impugned order dated 12.03.2015 passed in Writ Petition No.22736/2012 by the learned Single Judge whereby he allowed the writ petition filed by the Respondent No.1 directing the Appellants to pay to the Respondent No.1 a sum of Rs.600,000/- representing the second installment of the project.
2.
 Brief facts revealing from this Appeal are that the Respondent No.1 filed W.P. No.22736/2012 seeking a direction to the Appellant No.1 to release the second installment and to pay the enhanced cost of the project of construction of soling, drains, culverts, earth filling, park, sewerage Mufatpura Tara Ghar UC No.14 Ghohar Hithar @ 30 to 40% as per existing schedule of rates of Punjab Local Government (the ""PLG""), which was allowed by the learned Single Judge vide the impugned order. Hence, the instant Appeal.
3.
 Learned counsel for the Appellants submitted that the impugned order is against law and facts as the Respondent No.1 had not made party to TMA Kasur in the writ petition; that the payment to the Respondent No.1 was made for the work done but for the work which has not been done cannot be paid which fact has been ignored by the learned Single Judge; that the learned Single Judge has not taken into consideration the fact that the Respondent No.1 was seeking advance payment for the work which was to be done as yet; that the project was cancelled on 08.01.2015 and the same has not been challenged by anyone, as such the petition had become infructuous; that it was a matter of contractual obligation which cannot be resolved in writ jurisdiction. In support of his contentions learned counsel has placed reliance on the case titled Nagina Bakery v. Sui Southern Gas Limited and 3 others (2001 CLC 1559), Amir Nawaz Khan and 2 others v. Government of Pakistan through Secretary, Finance, Islamabad and 5 others (2001 CLC 185) and Lahore Cantonment Cooperative Housing Society Limited, Lahore Cantt., through Secretary v. Dr. Nusrat Ullah Chaudhry and others (PLD 2002 Supreme Court 1068).
4.
 We have heard the arguments of the learned counsel for the Appellants and examined the record available with this Appeal.
5.
 The main grievance of the Respondent No.1 in the writ petition was that a direction be issued to the Appellants to release second installment and to pay the enhanced cost of the project @ 30% to 40% as per existed scheduled rates of the PLG. The Appellants submitted report and parawise comments to contest the writ petition filed by the Respondent No.1. The thorough examination of the whole report and parawise comments reflects that nowhere in the same the payment of second installments has been denied by the Appellants rather it has been specifically mentioned in it that keeping in view the sensitively of the matter, Administrator Kasur has constituted a committee vide order No.78 ADM TMA KASUR dated 15.09.2012 for scrutiny/visit of old CCB's file/project who have applied for the next installment, to avoid any irregularity and erroneous payment (copy attached). The subject CCB matter shall also be reviewed by the committee and proceeded in the light of recommendation of the committee.
6.
 From the above, it is crystal clear that the Appellants have never denied the claim of the Respondent No.1 rather the same has been made conditional attaching with the recommendation of the committee constituted for scrutiny to avoid any irregularity and erroneous payment as allegedly multiple projects of the same nature were under pipeline in the jurisdiction of the Appellants. As such, the learned Single Judge has rightly held that the report was filed way back on 21.11.2012 but till date (12.03.2015) no decision was made on the payment of the bill for second installment amounting to Rs.600,000/- and the Appellants have failed to give any reasons for such a considerable delay in payment of the said installment despite the fact that the bill was submitted on 10.05.2011. Reliance in this regard can be placed on the case titled Messrs Usmani Associates v. Pakistan Housing Authority through Managing Director and 2 others (2005 MLD 233) wherein this Court held as under:
""Contents of the petition about non-payment of verified amount was not denied rather non-availability of funds was pleaded. On such admission in the pleadings or otherwise any party could apply for judgment or order to be made by the Court.""
7.
 Furthermore, the grounds taken by the Appellants in reply to the writ petition were duly dealt with by the learned Single Judge but the rest of the grounds raised before this Division Bench through filing the instant Appeal were not taken by the Appellants before the learned Single Judge, as such cannot be allowed to be agitated before this Division Bench as the same were available to them before passing the impugned order. The learned counsel for the Appellants has failed to point out any illegality or perversity in the impugned order which has been passed in consonance with the spirit of law. The case law relied upon by the learned counsel for the Appellants are distinguishable from the case in hand as each and every case has its own facts and circumstances, therefore, cannot be relied upon.
8.
 We agree with the finding of the learned Single Judge and see no illegality or jurisdictional error in the impugned order which has been passed in line with the dictates of law and does not warrant any interference by this Division Bench.
9.
 Resultantly, the instant Appeal is devoid of any merit and is accordingly dismissed.

 MUZAMIL AKHTAR SHABIR, J.---
This constitutional petition is directed against the order dated 22.11.2016 passed by the Election Tribunal, Sahiwal Division, Sahiwal, ('Election Tribunal') whereby the application filed by the respondents Nos.2 and 3 for amendment of the election petition by impleading two new sets of respondents, namely, Anees-ul-Mehdi along with Javaid Iqbal and Rustam Qurban along with Muhammad Amin, who were contesting candidates for the post of Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Union Council was allowed and the application filed by the petitioners for dismissal of the election petition for the reason of non-impleading necessary parties was dismissed.
2.
 The brief facts of the case are that the petitioners, respondent Nos.2 to 9 and four other persons contested election held on 31.10.2015, for the office of Chairman and Vice-Chairman of Union Council-122, District Okara. The petitioners were declared as returned candidates through result notified in the official gazette on 21.12.2015. On 18.01.2016, the Respondents Nos. 2 and 3 challenged the afore mentioned notification by filing election petition before the Election Tribunal. The petitioners contested the said petition by filing written reply on 11.04.2016. On 07.05.2016 respondents Nos.2 and 3 filed an application before Election Tribunal to seek amendment of pleadings by impleading the afore-referred four persons (two sets of contesting candidates) as respondents in the petition. On 19.05.2016, the petitioners filed an application for dismissal of the election petition and on 27.05.2016 filed reply to the application for amendment filed by respondents Nos.2 and 3. The Election Tribunal vide order dated 22.11.2016 dismissed the application filed by the petitioners for dismissal of the election petition and allowed the application filed by respondents Nos.2 and 3 for impleading additional respondents. The petitioners have called in question the order dated 22.11.2016 through this constitutional petition.
3.
 This Court issued notices to the respondents for 18.01.2017 on which date despite service respondents Nos.2 to 9 did not appear in the Court, therefore, this Court on the said date proceeded ex parte against the said respondents. However, subsequently counsel for the respondents Nos.2 and 3 appeared in the Court, who has been heard. With the consent of learned counsel for both the parties, the petition is admitted to regular hearing and is being decided as an admitted case.
4.
 The learned counsel for the petitioners has argued that according to Section 38 of the Punjab Local Government Act, 2013 and Rule 63 of the Punjab Local Government (Conduct of Elections) Rules, 2013 (""Rules, 2013"") all the contesting candidates were required to be impleaded as parties to contest the election petition and as the respondents did not implead the afore referred four candidates in the array of the parties, therefore, election petition was liable to be rejected / dismissed on this ground. He further contended that Election Tribunal was not justified to allow the respondents Nos.2 and 3 to implead the afore-referred four persons as respondents in this petition. Relies upon the judgment reported as Haji Khawand Bux Ghulam Muhammad Jahejo v. Sharjeel Inam Memon and 23 others (PLD 2016 Sindh 92) and Jaleel Ahmed v. Election Commission of Pakistan through Chief Election Commissioner and 8 others (2017 YLR 557) to argue that failure to implead necessary parties to the election petition (i.e. contesting candidates) is fatal to the election petition and the application for amendment has been filed as an afterthought and warranted to be declined.
5.
 The learned counsel for the respondents Nos.2 and 3 has supported the decision of the case and argued that the relevant law does not provide that the election petition is mandatorily to be dismissed during trial for the defect of non-impleading of contesting candidates and the judgments relied upon by the petitioners are not applicable to the present case.
6.
 The question for determination before this Court is whether the election petition is liable to be dismissed during trial for non-impleading of contesting candidates.
7.
 The case of Haji Khawand Bux Ghulam Muhammad Jahejo v. Sharjeel Inam Memon and 23 others (PLD 2016 Sindh 92) relates to the General Elections of 2013, wherein Representation of People Act, 1976 (`ROPA') was under consideration and the court held that non-joining of a contesting candidate was fatal to the election petition. In the said case the controversy revolved around sections 54(a) and 63 of the Representation of Peoples Act, 1976. The relevant sections are reproduced below:
""54. Parties to the petition.---The petitioner shall join as respondents to his election petition
 (a) all contesting candidates; and
(b) any other candidate against whom any allegation of any corrupt or illegal practice is made and shall serve personally or by registered post on each such respondent a copy of the petition.
Explanation.- In this section and in the following provisions of this chapter, ""corrupt or illegal practice"" means a ""corrupt practice"" or an ""illegal practice"" within the meaning of Chapter VIII.
63. Dismissal of petition during trial.---The Tribunal shall dismiss an election petition, if
 (a) the provisions of section 54 or section 55 have not been complied with; or
(b) if the petitioner fails to make the further deposit required under subsection (4) of section 62.""
In the afore-referred case as per section 54(a), the election petitioners was required to implead all the contesting candidates as parties to the petition and section 63 provided that the Tribunal shall dismiss the election petition for non-compliance of provision of section 54. The court held the said provision to be mandatory and dismissed the election petition for its non-compliance.
8.
 The case of Jaleel Ahmed (supra) relates to Local Government Elections held in the province of Sindh under the Sindh Local Councils (Election) Rules, 2015 and deals with rules 61 and 64, thereof, which are reproduced below:
 ""61. The Petitioner shall join as respondents to his election petition--
 (a) all contesting candidates; and
(b) any other person against whom any allegation, if any, of corrupt or illegal practice is made and shall serve personally or by courier service or registered post on each such respondent a copy of his petition.
64. If the Tribunal is satisfied that all or any of the preceding provisions have not been complied with, the petition shall be dismissed forthwith and submit its report to the Election Commission.""
In the said case the relevant portion of the judgment is reproduced below:
""In the case reported as Zia Ur Rehman v. Syed Ahmed Hussain (2014 SCMR 1015), wherein the Hon'ble apex Court has held that when the law prescribes a certain format of an Election Petition and its verification on oath and entails a penal consequences of its non-compliance. It is a mandatory provision. If an objection is raised with regard to maintainability of such a petition for non-compliance of a mandatory provision, the Court/Tribunal should decide that preliminary objection. Because if that objection is sustained then the Court is left with no option but to dismiss the petition.""
In the said case the election petition was dismissed because of non-compliance of mandatory provision of verification of the petition as required by rule 62(3) of the Sindh Local Councils (Election) Rules, 2015. In the said case the relevant law provided that non-impleading of necessary parties and failure of verification of election petition would result in its dismissal.
9.
 Although both the afore-referred cases relate to Election laws but the same do not relate to the dispute under consideration in the present election petition under the Punjab Local Government Act, 2013 and rules framed thereunder, rather the afore referred Act of 1976 refers to the election for the Provincial and National Assemblies and Sindh Local Councils (Election) Rules relates to local Government Elections in province of Sindh.
The present dispute relates to the Punjab Local Government Act, 2013 and Rules framed thereunder. Section 38 of Punjab Local Government Act, 2013 is reproduced below:
""38. Election petition.---(1) Subject to this Act, an election to an office of a Local Government shall not be called in question except by an election petition.
(2) A candidate may, in the prescribed manner, file an election petition before the Election Tribunal challenging an election under this Act.""
Rule 63(1) of the Rules, 2013 is reproduced below:---
""63(1). Parties to the petition.---(1) The petitioner shall join all contesting candidates as respondents to his election petition and shall serve personally or by registered post (acknowledgment due) on each respondent a copy of his petition.
 ..........""
10.
 As per section 38 an election can only be called in question by filing an election petition by a candidate in the prescribed manner before the Election Tribunal. Rule 63 provides that the petitioner is required to join all contesting candidates to the election petition and serve personally or by registered post on each respondent a copy of his petition. However, no consequence has been provided for the noncompliance of the afore-referred provision and the same does not make the election petition as liable to be dismissed as is provided in ROPA, 1976 or the Sindh Local Government (Conduct of Elections) Rules, 2015. The rule 70 of the Rules, 2013 applicable in Punjab provides for dismissal of the petition during trial which is re-produced below:
""70. Dismissal of petition during trial.---
The Tribunal may dismiss an election petition if---
(a)
 The provisions of rules 67 and 68 have not been complied with; or
(b)
 The allegation contained therein are vague or do not disclose the commission of any corrupt practice, material irregularity or any other illegal act""
11.
 In the afore referred rules, the grounds for dismissal of election petition are that provisions of Rules 67 and 68 are not complied with or the allegations contained in the petition are vague or do not disclose the commission of any corrupt practice, material irregularity or any other illegality. Rule 67 provides for appearance of parties before the Tribunal including appearance as a consequence of order passed by the Tribunal and rule 68 provides for procedure before Tribunal. Both the afore-referred rules do not relate to the parties to be impleaded in the election petition. No other ground has been mentioned in the rule 70 providing for dismissal of the petition during trial. Usually a provision prescribing some legal consequences for non-compliance of a provision is treated as mandatory as mentioned in the case reported as Zia ur Rehman v. Syed Ahmed Hussain (2014 SCMR 2015). However, in the present case no consequence is provided for not impleading contesting candidates as parties to the petition, therefore, the same can be treated as a directory provision.
12.
 The learned counsel for the petitioners has argued that as the provision of the ROPA and Local Government laws applicable in Sindh are similar to the Rules, 2013 therefore, on the basis of the said laws and interpretation given in the judgments cited above, the provision of section 63 is to be treated as mandatory. What is not given in this rule cannot be read into the said rule by this Court by referring to the provisions of ROPA, 1976, and laws applicable in Province of Sindh as it would amount to doing violence to the provisions of law as provided in the Local Government Act, 2013 as well as Rules, 2013. Reliance in this regard may be placed on Zahid Iqbal v. Hafiz Muhammad Adnan and others (2016 SCMR 430) wherein it has been laid down as under:
""It is, not the function of the Court to read into any provision and or words that are not part of the statute, unless imported or made applicable specifically as has been done under the Sindh Local Government Act, 2013, wherein section 36(j) clearly imports disqualification ""under any law"" it reads ""he is for the time being disqualified or chosen as a member of the Provincial Assembly under any law for the time being in force."" It is neither the duty nor the function of the Court to read into or delete any word and or provisions in an enactment, unless specifically adopted or imported by reference. Courts do not legislate but interpret statute according to their ordinary and plain meaning and do not import and or supply word or provisions from ""any other law"", no matter how laudable and desirable it may appear to be. In this view of the matter, disqualification prescribed under ""any law"" or even in ""The Constitution"" unless as noted above are specifically made applicable or adopted by reference, specially penal and or castigatory provisions contained in ""any law"" cannot be imported, read into or inflicted on a person who put forth his candidature to be elected as a Member or to hold an elected office of Punjab Local Government but his qualification and or disqualification for any office of the Punjab Local Government is to be adjudged strictly under the provisions of ""the Act, 2013"" only.""
In view of the principle laid down in the afore referred judgments of the Supreme Court, it is held that the provisions of rule 63 are not mandatory but directory.
13.
 Keeping in view what has been discussed above, ground to dismiss the election petition during trial on the basis of not impleading contesting candidates is not made out. Consequently it is observed that the Election Tribunal has rightly dismissed the application filed by the petitioners for dismissal of the afore-referred petition. However, it is observed that the learned Election Tribunal is not precluded from determining on merits of the case, the effect of not impleading parties to the Election petition at the time of final disposal of the election petition by keeping in view the contents of the Election petition and the evidence and material available on the record, which shall be decided without being influenced by any of the observations made in this decision.
14.
 As regard to the amendment of the election petition by adding additional parties allowed by the Election Tribunal, reference may be made to Rule 68(5) which provides as under:
""68. Procedure before Tribunal.--
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
 The Tribunal may, at any time, on such terms and on payment of such costs as it may direct, allow a petition to be amended in such a manner as may, in its opinion, be necessary for ensuring a fair and effective trial and for determining the real questions in controversy, provided that no new ground of challenge to the election is permitted to be raised.""
15.
 According to the afore referred rule, the Election Tribunal is competent to allow amendment of the petition subject to the terms and conditions it thinks fit provided no new ground of challenge to the election is sought to be added by the petitioner. The Election Tribunal has imposed cost of Rs.10,000/- upon respondents Nos. 2 and 3 for allowing them to make the afore-referred contesting candidates as respondents in this petition. The permission to amend the petition was discretionary with the Election Tribunal which discretion has been exercised by it on the basis of material available before it. This Court in constitutional petition does not ordinarily interfere in the discretionary orders passed by the Court/Tribunal of competent jurisdiction unless the same suffer from illegality, perversity or erroneous exercise of jurisdiction.
16.
 No illegality, infirmity, perversity or erroneous exercise of jurisdiction has been pointed out in the orders passed by Election Tribunal therefore, no ground for interference is made out.
17.
 For what has been discussed above, this petition being devoid of any merit is dismissed.

22,"AQEEL AHMED alias TILOO Versus State","June 9, 2017","KARACHI HIGH COURT SINDH"," Honorable Justice Abdul Maalik Gaddi ","2018 PCrLJN 12","JUDGMENT
 ABDUL MAALIK GADDI, J.---
Through instant appeal, the appellant has challenged the Judgment dated 23.12.2015 passed by the learned Judge, Anti-Terrorism Court No.1, Karachi in Special Case No.A-304 of 2014 (Re: The State v. Aqeel Ahmed alias Tiloo) arising out of Crime No.425 of 2014 registered under Section 4/5 Explosive Substance Act, read with Section 7 ATA, 1997 of police station Zaman Town, Karachi, whereby the learned trial Court after full dressed trial convicted and sentenced the appellant in point No.02 of the impugned judgment. For the sake of convenience, it would be appropriate to reproduce Point No.2 of the said judgment, which reads as under:-
""In view of my findings on point No. I, the prosecution has proved its charge against the accused Aqeel Ahmed alias Tiloo son of Din Muhammad beyond any shadow of doubt, I, therefore, convict him under section 265-H(2) and sentence him R.I. for 14 years, for the offence punishable under section 70 of Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. The benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C. is also extended to him. Accused Aqeel Ahmed alias Tiloo son of Din Muhammad present on bail is taken into custody and remanded to jail to serve out the sentence.""
2.
 The brief facts of the prosecution case as per FIR lodged on 05.11.2014 at 1450 hours by the complainant SIP Manoomal to the effect that on the said date, he along with ASI Akhtar Hussain and HC Muhammad Asghar during patrolling and prevention of crimes, as per information by the informer, when reached near Noorani Graveyard Sector-48/H, Korangi No.1, Karachi at about 2.00 p.m., they saw one person coming from graveyard in suspicious condition, on the signal by the informer he apprehended him. On inquiry, he disclosed his name as Aqeel Ahmed alias Tiloo son of Din Muhammad, due to non-availability of private person he took his personal search in the presence of Mashirs and recovered one hand grenade wrapped in plastic bag from the pocket of shalwar of accused. He arrested him and prepared memo of arrest and recovery. Brought the accused and case property to the police stdtion and register the FIR.
3.
 It appears from the record that after registration of FIR, the investigation was carried by Inspector Aftab Ali Rind, who after recording the statements of PWs under section 161, Cr.P.C. and after receiving clearance certificate of Rifle Grenade from ASI Mazhar Shah as well as final report from the Bomb Disposal Unit, submitted the charge sheet against the appellant in the Court of law.
4.
 It also appears from the record that in order to establish accusation against the appellant/accused, prosecution had examined in all four witnesses namely SIP Manoomal as PW-1 at Ex.04, he produced copy of roznamcha entry No. 13, memo of arrest and recovery, FIR, being Crime No.425/2014, under Section 4/5 Explosive Substance Act, read with Section 7 ATA, 1997, roznamcha entry regarding his arrival being entry No.15 and memo of inspection place of incident at Ex.04/A to Ex.04/E, respectively, SIP Syed Akhtar Hussain as PW-2 at Ex.05, SIP Muhammad Ayoob as PW-3 at Ex.06, he produced clearance certificate at Ex.06/A, final report and entry No.14 and entry No.16 about his arrival from police station Zaman Town at Ex.06/A to Ex.06/C respectively. Finally the prosecution examined Inspector Aftab Ali Rind as Ex.PW-04 at Ex.07, he produced order of SSP, roznamcha entry Nos.22 and 33, two letters addressed to Bomb Disposal Unit as well as sanction of Home Department at Ex.07/A to Ex.07/F respectively. Counsel for the appellant cross-examined the prosecution witnesses. Thereafter, vide statement as Ex.08, learned Deputy District Public Prosecutor for the State closed the side of prosecution.
5.
 It reveals from the record that the appellant in his statement under section 342, Cr.P.C. at Ex.09 of the R&Ps has denied the case and claim of the prosecution by stating that he is innocent and has been falsely implicated by the police in this case with mala fide intention as nothing was recovered from his possession. He further stated that he was apprehended by the Rangers officials from his house and after filing Constitution Petition No.5621 of 2014 on 05.11.2014 in this Court by his father, he was handed over to police, as such, he was involved in the present case.
6.
 It is argued by the learned counsel for the appellant that appellant is innocent and has falsely been implicated in the present case. There are major contradictions in the evidence of the witnesses examined by the prosecution. Per learned counsel, from the bare reading of the FIR, it reflects that one hand grenade was recovered from the possession of appellant, whereas, in the charge sheet submitted by the I.G. and report of Bomb Disposal Unit reflects that one rifle grenade was recovered from the possession of appellant. Per learned counsel, the Bomb Disposal Unit has issued clearance certificate on 05.11.2014 and final report on 26.11.2014 in respect of the grenade allegedly recovered from the possession of appellant, whereas, alleged incident had taken place on 05.11.2014, which clearly reflects that the clearance certificate and report of Bomb Disposal Unit have been manipulated by the prosecution. Per learned counsel, the appellant was taken away by the Rangers Personnel on 29.10.2014 from his house at about 6.00 a.m., later on after filing constitution petition by the father of appellant, he was handed over to the police, and subsequently, he was booked in the present false case. Per learned counsel, there is violation of section 103, Cr.P.C., as no any independent witness from the locality has been cited as witness of the incident. The entire investigation has been conducted dishonestly, therefore, appellant may be acquitted by giving him benefit of doubt.
7.
 Conversely, learned Assistant Prosecutor General, Sindh has supported the impugned judgment by, stating that the impugned judgment has been passed by the trial Court after considering all the documents and evidence on record. Per learned APO, one hand grenade has been recovered from the possession of accused in presence of Mashirs, who have no enmity with the appellant, therefore, according to him this appeal is liable to be dismissed.
8.
 We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant, learned APG and scanned the available record. Perusal of FIR dated 05.11.2014 and Challan dated 12.11.2014 as well as recovery memo clearly show that one hand grenade was recovered from the appellant. However, the inspection report of Bomb Disposal Unit dated 26.11.2014 shows that SI Ayub Baloch of Bomb Disposal Unit along with his team reached at police station Zaman Town, Karachi and during inspection found one rifle grenade in live condition, which if used with proper technique (fire by rifle) has caused loss of lives and damage to properties. There is big difference between ""hand grenade"" and ""rifle grenade"" and perusal of FIR, challan and inspection report of Bomb Disposal Unit create doubt and suspicion as to nature and description of the alleged recovery from the appellant. There is big contradiction with regard to nature of recovery from the appellant. Therefore, on this ground, false implication of the appellant in this case cannot be ruled out. During the course of arguments, we have specifically asked the question from learned APG to explain the nature of recovery from the appellant with regard to rifle grenade and hand grenade, but he did not reply satisfactory. We noticed that learned trial Court framed the Charge against the appellant for alleged recovery of rifle grenade, which was not the basis of FIR as well as recovery memo and challan sheet. Column No.5 of Challan sheet further shows overwriting in the said column. Therefore, on this ground, the judgment of the trial Court is not sustainable in the eye of law.
9.
 We -have gone through the case of Tariq Pervez v. The State reported as 1995 SCMR 1345, wherein it has been held that if a single circumstance creates reasonable doubt in the prudent mind about the guilt of the accused then he will be entitled to such benefit not as a matter of grace, but as a matter of right. Similar view has also been taken in the case of Muhammad Akram v. The State reported as 2009 SCMR 230.
10.
 It is also the case of the appellant that he was picked up by the Rangers Personnel on 29.10.2014 at about 6.00 a.m. as such, his father and other family members approached to the concerned police station and submitted application, but they refused to receive the same, as such, on 05.11.2014, his father sent application through TCS at police station Zaman Town, Karachi, which was received by him on 05.11.2014 at about 10:56:04 a.m. and also filed Constitution Petition No.5621 of 2014 before this Court. These facts are found supported with the documents available at pages 75, 77 and 77 of the appeal file, but the FIR in the present case has been registered on 05.11.2014 at about 1450 hours much after the receipt of application of appellant's father through TCS to SHO Zaman Town, Karachi. buring the course of arguments, when we confronted with the above factual position to the learned APO, no plausible answer with him.
11.
 We have also perused the evidence and documents on record and have also considered the version of both the parties put forward by them through evidence and found that the version of the appellant seems more plausible and convincing, while the version of the prosecution is totally doubtful.
12.
 For our above stated reasons, we have no hesitation to hold that the prosecution has failed to prove its case against the appellant and learned trial Court did not appreciate the evidence and documents on record properly. Consequently, this appeal is allowed. The impugned Judgment passed by the trial Court is set aside. Resultantly, the appellant is acquitted from the charge. He is in jail, therefore, jail authorities are directed to release the appellant forthwith, if he is not required in any other case.
13.
 This appeal was allowed by our short order after hearing the learned counsel for the parties on 08.06.2017 and these are the reasons thereof.

CH. MUHAMMAD IBRAHIM ZIA, C.J.--- 
The titled appeal by leave of the Court is filed against the judgment of the High Court dated 19.02.2016, whereby the writ petition filed by the appellant, herein, has been dismissed.
2. The appellant, herein, filed a writ petition before the High Court on 22.10.2015 and claimed that vide advertisement dated 03.07.2013 various posts of constables reserve/ranger were advertised. His father is serving as Assistant Director B-17 the Police Department, so he applied for the job against 5% quota reserved for children of Police employees. He passed the test and interview and secured 56-1/2 marks. His name was entered at serial No.58 of the general merit list. It was further claimed that the official respondents instead of inserting the name of petitioner in the merit list of policemen sons and appointing him on regular basis as constable against the reserved quota, appointed him as constable on contract basis vide order dated 23.07.2013, whereas, the private respondents who are lower in merit have been illegally appointed as constables on regular basis. He prayed for direction of his regular appointment. The learned High Court, after necessary proceedings dismissed the writ petition through the impugned judgment.
3. Mr. Fiaz Ahmed Janjua, Advocate, the learned counsel for the appellant after narration of necessary facts submitted that the impugned judgment of learned High Court is result of misconception of law and facts. The authority vide notification dated 16.11.2011 fixed 5% vacancies of constables for children of serving and retired police officers/officials. The father of the appellant is admittedly the police officer/official serving as Assistant Director BPS-17 in the Police Department. In furtherance of the advertised posts, the appellant also appeared in test and interview and obtained 56-1/2 marks, whereas, from the District Muzaffarabad the children of police officers/officials who obtained less marks have been appointed while discriminating the appellant on the ground that his father is serving in the Police Department in ministerial staff, thus, he does not fall within the scope of reserved quota. The appellant feeling aggrieved filed a writ petition which has been decided by the learned single Judge of the High Court through the impugned judgment. The learned single Judge has fell in error of law and facts. The father of the appellant, who is admittedly serving as Assistant Director in the Police Department, falls in definition of police officer/official. The opinion drawn by the learned High Court is against law and facts, therefore, the impugned judgment is not sustainable. Consequently, while accepting this appeal the prayed relief directing for appointment of the appellant according to merit being son of police officer/official, be granted.
4. Conversely, M/s. Raza Ali Khan, Advocate-General and Kokab Al Saba Roohi, Advocate, the learned counsel for the respondents submitted that although the appellant is son of Assistant Director of the Police Department and he also appeared in test and interview and obtained 56-1/2 marks but as his father is not police officer/official, therefore, he cannot be appointed against reserved quota. His father is serving in the ministerial staff which is not included in the scope of prescribed quota, therefore, the impugned judgment is in accordance with law calling for no interference.
5. We have considered the arguments of learned counsel for the parties and examined the record made available. The material facts have been admitted by the respondents in their pleadings. It has also been admitted that the father of appellant, Manzoor Ahmed Awan, is serving in the Police Department in the office of Deputy Inspector General of Police reserve/range as Assistant Director BPS-17. It is further admitted that 5% quota for the children of serving/retired police officers/officials is fixed. The factual proposition of appearing of the appellant in test and interview and obtaining 56-1/2 marks is also admitted. The only reason advanced for not appointing him is that his father is serving in the ministerial staff of the police department, thus, he is not included in the definition of police officer/official. It will be beneficial to reproduce here the relevant part of the notification dated 16.11.2016, which reads as follows:-
""5% of the vacancies of Constable shall be filled in from amongst the children of serving/retried police officers/officials against the said quota as Constable, such recruitment/ appointment shall be made by the appointing authority on the recommendation of Departmental Selection Committee.""
In this notification the words used are ""children of police officers/officials"". There is no distinction of District, range, reserve police or field or ministerial staff. The word used is ""officers/officials"". According to sixth Edition of Black's Law Dictionary the word ""officer"" means ""a person holding the office of trust, command or authority incorporation, government, armed services or other institution or organization"". Same like, the word ""official"" is also defined as ""a person invested with the authority of his office"". In view of clear phraseology of the notification dated 16.11.2016 and dictionary meaning it hardly requires any further deliberation that all the permanent civil servants of police department fall within the scope of ""officer/official"". Our this view also finds support from the provisions of section 2 of the Police Act, 1861 as enforced in the Azad Jammu and Kashmir. The referred section reads as follows:-
""2. Constitution of the force.- The entire police establishment under a Provincial Government for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to be one police-force, and shall be formally enrolled; and shall consist of such number of officers and men, and shall be constituted in such manner, as shall from time to time be ordered by the Provincial Government.""
The above statutory provision clear speaks that the entire police establishment is deemed to be one police-force. As admittedly, the appellant's father is serving in police establishment holding the post of Assistant Director, thus, he falls within the scope of the notification dated 16.11.2016 and is police officer/official. Thus, the authority as well as the High Court has drawn incorrect conclusion.
6. According to the admitted facts, the merit position of the appellant is higher to the candidates appointed from District Muzaffarabad who obtained 55 and 54-1/2 marks, whereas, the appellant obtained 56-1/2 marks. Thus, denial of the right of the petitioner regarding his appointment against 5% quota being son of police official is against law. Therefore, while accepting this appeal and recalling the impugned judgment of the High Court the writ petition filed by the appellant is accepted and the authority is directed to appoint him being son of police official according to his merit position.
This appeal stands accepted with no order as to costs.

 IJAZ ANWAR, J.---
 Through this petition, the petitioner seeks the redressal of his grievances by submitting the following facts:-
1.
 The petitioner is a lawful owner and bona fide purchaser of vehicle bearing Registration No.P-3758, Chasses No.LH 110-0006672 Engine No.2 RZ0007999. The petitioner lost the original Registration book in the year 2008, he duly reported to the local police, which was reduced to a Naqal Mad dated 10.1.2008. He then applied for duplicate copy of the registration to the respondents. It is alleged that before the issuance of duplicate copy dated 13.8.2008, the petitioner found the original Registration and requested for the cancellation of Duplicate copy and that he be allowed to retain the original. The petitioner claimed that due to duplicate registration copy, the vehicle has lost its resale value, and the vehicle once sold was returned to him on the ground that the duplicate copy is creating doubt about the ownership of the vehicle. The request of the petitioner for cancelling the duplicate and permitting him to retain the original registration book was declined to him allegedly in the light of certain instructions contained in office order No.13055/DD (Lit) dated 25.5.2012. The petitioner initially filed W.P.No.2931 of 2014 for the same relief, however, this Court vide judgment and order dated 26.11.2014 treated the writ petition as appeal and sent the same to the department for its decision.
2.
 The appeal of the petitioner was disposed of vide order dated 12.2.2015 on the ground that under Rule 40 of Motor Vehicle Rule, 1969 if the lost original Registration book is found it is liable to cancellation and the duplicate will remain in the field.
3.
 The respondents were put to notice and directed to file parawise comments to the writ petition. They responded to the averment of the writ petition and summarized it in paras-6 and 9. Para-6 and 9 of the comments are reproduced below:-
6.
 In reply to para-6, it is submitted that on 25.2.2012, the Director General Excise and Taxation Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Peshawar vide office order No.1628/Taxation dated 01.09.2008, by directing all the Motor Registering Authorities to consider the recovered/found registration book, as cancelled in light of provisions of Rule 40 of Motor Vehicle Rules, 1969.
9.
 In reply to para-9, it is submitted that the request of petitioner was acceded to, in accordance with law, and direction of this august court was followed and the required appropriate order was passed with regard to original registration of vehicle-in-question, which in purview of Rule 40 of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Motor Vehicles Rules, 1969, is liable to be cancelled and is required to be retained by the office of Motor Registering Authority, Peshawar.
4.
 Arguments heard and record perused.
5.
 In order to appreciate the present controversy, we would like to refer to the relevant provision of Rules that deal with the cases of lost and subsequently found registration book. Rule-38 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Motor Vehicle Rules, 1969 deal with the eventualities of lost Registration book and issuance of Duplicate copy of Registration. Rule-38 ibid is reproduced for convenience:-
38.
 
Loss or Destruction of Certificate of Registration and Certificate of Fitness of a Transport Vehicle:
 (1) If at any time the certificate of registration or the certificate of fitness of a transport vehicle is lost or destroyed, the owner shall forthwith intimate the facts in writing to the registering authority by whom the certificate of registration was issued or by whom the registration mark was assigned under section 30 and shall apply in Form C.R.L.D. Tran. To the said authority for the issue of a duplicate certificate of registration of certificate of fitness.
(2)
 Upon receipt of an application in Form C.R.L.D. Tran Together with a fee of rupees five the registering authority may, after making such enquiries as appear necessary and obtaining particulars of the original certificate of fitness from the Motor Vehicle Examiner or licensed Automobile Workshop by whom it was issued or last renewed, issue a duplicate certificate of registration and certificate of fitness in Forms G and I, respectively, clearly stamped ""Duplicate"" in red ink.
(3)
 No person shall be liable to be convicted of an offence under section 90 if at any time when the certificate is demanded, he has already reported the loss or destruction thereof in accordance with the provisions of this rule and duplicate certificate has not been delivered to him.
6.
 Rule 40 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Motor Vehicle Rules, 1969 deal with the issues when the lost Registration is subsequently found. Rule 40 is reproduced below:-
40.
 
Procedure When a Last Certificate is Subsequently Founded
:- (1) When a duplicate certificate of fitness or certificate of registration has been issued upon representation that the original, has been lost and the original is afterwards found by the holder; the original certificate of fitness or certificate of registration shall be delivered forthwith to the registering authority.
(2)
 Any other person finding a certificate of fitness or certificate of registration shall deliver it to the holder or to the nearest police station.
7.
 Rule 38 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Motor Vehicle Rules, 1969 is quite exhaustive and deal with the procedure how to deal with the issue to provide the duplicate copy of the Registration Book while Rule 40 only provides that where the original Registration Book is found subsequently it shall be returned to the Registering Authority, but it is silent to the fact that which one of the Registration books, original or duplicate will remain in the field.
8.
 Initially vide office order dated 01.9.2008 of the Director General, Excise and Taxation, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa; Peshawar instructions were issued to the following effect. Para-2 is reproduced below:-
""In order to facilitate the general public all Motor Registering Authorities are directed to consider the recovered computerized registration book as original one and cancel and file the duplicate registration book on the basis of FIR/Naqalmad after observing all codal formalities"".
9.
 According to the respondents the letter dated 1.9.2008 has been superseded by office order dated 25.5.2012 of the same authority. Para-2 is reproduced below:-
""In order to facilitate the general public and to stream line the office work all Motor registering authorities are directed to consider the recovered/found registration book as cancelled one as mentioned in rule 40 of Motor Vehicle Rules, 1969. Therefore, the Office Order vide No.1628/ Taxation dated 01.09.2008 issued by this Directorate General as withdrawn with immediate effect"".
10.
 As observed earlier Rule 40 ibid reproduced above only refer to the fact that when the original Registration book is found subsequently, it shall be returned to the Motor Registration Authority but it is silent how to deal with it subsequently. The instructions issued vide office order dated 01.9.2008 of the Registration Authority were quite reasonable and appeal to reasons, however, the subsequent instructions issued vide office order dated 12.5.2012 is against the intension and plain reading of Rule 40 ibid and had given such construction, which it no where suggest.
11.
 It is by now well settled that construction of a statute should be beneficial to the citizen and if there could be two interpretations of a provision of law in a statute, the one which was consistent with reasons should be adopted and the one which lead to absurdity or unreasonableness or patent injustice to a citizen should be avoided, therefore, the construction placed on a provision in a statute, should be such as would suppress the mischief and advance the remedy. Reliance placed on 2016 SCMR 646, 2015 SCMR 1494, PLD 2016 Peshawar 26 and 2013 PCr.LJ 52 (KHC). 
12.
 We having examined the Rules and the construction placed on it through two conflicting letters dated 01.9.2008 and 25.5.2012, and tends to resolve it by upholding the letter dated 01.9.2008 to be more reasonable and beneficial for the citizens as it suppress the mischief and advance the remedy.
13.
 For what has been stated above, we allow this writ petition and direct the respondents to hand over the original Registration book to the petitioner by cancelling the duplicate.
14.
 This writ petition is allowed in the above terms.

This judgment disposes off Customs Appeal No.K-820/2016 filed by the Appellant against Order-in-Appeal No.57/2016, dated 26.1.2016 passed by the Collector of Customs (Appeals), Karachi.
2.
 Brief facts of the case as reported in the impugned order-in-appeal are that the appellant imported a consignment of ""High Efficiency Agricultural Irrigation Submersible pump"" from China against GD Machine No.KAPE-HC-64575-13-11-2015 under the HS Code 8413.7010 was declared at the rate of unit value of US$ 15.5000 whereas correct description was ""Deep Well Submersible Pump with Built in Motor made of Stainless Steel Body along with Pump"" assessable at value US$ 30.000.
3.
 On appeals filed by the Appellant against the assessment of goods finalized under Goods Declaration
 bearing No.KAPE-HC-64575-13-11-2015 by the Model Customs Collectorate of Appraisement-East, Custom House, Karachi, the Collector of Customs (Appeals), Karachi vide Order-in-Appeal No.57/2016 dated 26.01.2016, passed the following order:-
 ""I have examined the case record. The appellants are aggrieved on two counts that they were not allowed the concession admissible to them under 5th Schedule to the Customs Act, 1969 and 6th Schedule to the Sales Tax Act, 1990, also their customs value was enhanced. The responding department during the hearing proceedings claimed that the appellants have not established that the goods were for specific use in Agriculture, some of the sizes are for domestic/ house hold use, above all these goods are manufactured locally, therefore the aforesaid concessions are not admissible. The appellants stated that locally manufactured pumps are all made of stainless steel, whereas in imported goods, only outer body is made of steel, however they could not justify this claim with any certification from EDB. Being made of stainless steel, determination of customs value by the respondents is at par with similar goods. I do not find any reason to disturb the assessment. The appeal being without merit fails.""
4.
 Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the above order, the Appellants filed an appeal before this Tribunal on the following grounds:-
A.
 That the value of the impugned goods was enhanced in violation to mandate of subsection (1) of Section 25 of Customs Act, 1969. The transaction value (the prices paid) was not rebutted by the respondents. The transaction value of the impugned goods is correct and the same is the Customs value under the law for payment of duty taxes.
B.
 That the respondents have frustrated, the genuine transaction value, arbitrarily and enhanced the same equal to twice of the transaction value, without disclosing the basis for same. The respondents did not issue notice for enhancement of the value as mandated under Section 25(4) ibid, and acted in violation to Article 10-A of the Constitution vide citation 2008 SCMR 438.
C.
 That the respondents, as per prevailing practice, had been assessing the value of the impugned goods as per the transaction value. Moreover, the respondents have been assessing the same commodity at the transaction value even after the date of assessment made in the impugned G. D.
D.
 That the major, main and typical working parts such as (i) impeller, (ii) diffuser, and (iii) non-return valve of the subject consignment are made of thermoplastic resin are molded produced. Whereas M/s. HMA fabricate the said items from stainless steel, an expensive process, moreover, it has annual manufacturing capacity for production of same capacity pumps equal to 600 pieces.
E.
 That the demand and import, of the same capacity submersible pumps, in Pakistan is more than 500,000 units annually and a manufacturer having 600 pieces annually cannot cater the demand of 500,000 pieces being imported into Pakistan from worldwide sources. The goods under the present case are of China Origin, the price paid in the present case is verifiable through the Embassy of Pakistan in China and the international inspecting agency SGS etc.
F.
 That the respondent under apparent non-bona fides, for undue enrichment, did not opt for independent inquiry for verification of genuineness of the transaction value, which was the customs value under Section 25(1) of the Customs Act, 1969. The act of omission or commission for frustration of the transaction value is unlawful, unconstitutional, without jurisdiction under misuse of authority as to cause injury to the appellant.
G.
 That the appellant has imported the submersible pumps for agricultural purposes, and the same are being used in agricultural usage, including but not limited to watering or dewatering from under soil or soil. The respondent has no authority to deny the usage and purpose of imported goods for apparent non-bona fide for denial of right of exemption available to the appellant.
H.
 That the submersible pumps (falling under HS Code 8413.7040) are equally useable for agricultural purposes, hence qualifies the concessionary rate of customs duty as prescribed under Section 18 (1A) of the Customs Act, 1969 instead of Section 18(l) ibid. The condition of local manufacturing is not applicable, on the subject goods, because the submersible pumps are made of plastic parts, which are not being manufactured locally.
I.
 That the submersible pumps (classifiable under HS Code 8413.7010) under import are exempt from the levy of Sales Tax under the mandate of Section 13 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 at Serial
 No.
 113 of the Sixth Schedule.
 There
 is
 no
 condition
 of local manufacturing, for exemption from payment of sales tax, is prescribed under the Sixth Schedule to the Sales Tax Act, 1990.
 It is, therefore, humbly prayed that kindly pass an order as to:
 
 annul the impugned Order-in-Appeal as well as Assessment Order, passed by the respondents, without determination of facts and laws of the appellant's case, rather the assessment was made on refusal to accept the evidences of past clearances and applicable laws;
 
 directions to the respondent No. 2 to refund the exceeded amount of duty and taxes to the appellant forthwith.
5
 The Respondent Department have submitted their counter-objections/comments in terms of 194-A (4) of the Customs Act, 1969 which are reproduced as under:--
A)
 That the contents of Para (A) are absolutely false and baseless, hence vehemently denied. The fact is that since the value declared was found incorrect and at lower side, accordingly the same was enhanced on the basis of cogent evidences and data and as such the same is neither arbitrarily nor the declared value is actual transaction value in terms of Section 25(1) of the Customs Act, 1969.
B)
 That the contents of Para (B) are also absolutely false and baseless, hence vehemently denied. The fact is that since the value declared by the appellant was crystal clearly been found at lower side and the same cannot be said to be the actual transaction value, accordingly the same was enhanced on the basis of available data and evidences of the actual description of the goods. There is no violation of Section 25(4) of the Customs Act, 1969 and Article 10-A of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 as alleged. The case law reported has no relevancy with the instant case.
C)
 That the contents of Para (C) are repetition of Para 6 above for which reply has been given and as such this Para require no further comments.
D)
 That as regards the contents of Para (D) it is submitted that the appellant has immensely failed at the stage of assessment of goods to provide any substantive cogent documentary evidence to establish that the goods were for specific use in Agriculture, some of the sizes were for domestic/house hold use and as such the same does not justify the description as the appellant tried the appellant in Para under reply.
E)
 That the contents of Para (E) are self explanatory and are not in the knowledge of the answering respondent except that the consignment was imported from China, hence require no comments.
F)
 That the contents of Para (F) are also absolutely false and baseless, hence vehemently denied. The fact is that since the valid and available data and evidences are available for the assessment of the goods, there was no need for conducting any enquiry regarding the transaction value as alleged by the appellant in Para under reply.
G)
 That the contents of Para (G) are repetition of previous Para. It is however reiterated here that the appellant has immensely failed at the stage of assessment of goods to provide any substantive cogent documentary evidence to establish that the goods were for specific use in Agriculture, some of the sizes were for domestic/house hold use and as such the same does not justify the description as the appellant tried the appellant in Para under reply.
H)
 That the contents of Para (H) are repetition of previous Para for which reply has been given, hence this Para require no further comments.
I)
 That the contents of Para (I) are also false and baseless, hence vehemently denied. The fact is that the exemption of Sales Tax was also not available to the appellant. The appellant has incorrectly interpreted the 6th schedule to the Customs Act, 1969.
 It is, therefore humbly prayed that this Honorable Tribunal may graciously dismiss the appeal of the appellant being devoid of merits.
6.
 I have heard both the contesting parties as well as examined the relevant record. As per record, the Appellant has not declared correct description of his goods. He declared the same as High Efficiency Agriculture Irrigation Submersible pump valuing US$ 15/Pieces. However, on examination by the Respondent Department, the same was found to be ""Deep Well Submersible Pump with Built-in Motor made of Stainless Steel Body along with Pump"". The Department assessed value at US$ 30/Piece based on relevant data available with them. With change of description, the value of goods was changed. The said position shows that the Appellant deliberately misdeclared description so that the same could be assessed at lower value i.e. USD 15/piece. On the issue of its use, the Appellant has not rebutted the arguments of the Respondent Department
 that
 some
 of
 the
 Pumps
 have
 size
 and
 specification
 which
 are used for domestic purpose and not for Agriculture. The exemption of customs duty and sales tax in Fifth Schedule to the Customs Act, 1969 and Sixth Schedule to the Sales Tax Act, 1990 respectively is subject to the condition that the goods are used for Agriculture purpose. Furthermore, the goods are also manufactured locally
 as
 per
 C.G.O.
 11
 of 2007.
 The
 preamble
 of
 the
 Fifth
 Schedule
 to Customs Act, 1969 clearly stipulates that the benefit of the Schedule is not available to locally-manufactured goods. Regarding Appellant's contention that the locally-manufactured Pumps, are made of stainless
 steel
 whereas
 in
 imported
 Pumps
 only
 outer
 body
 is
 made
 of steel, I subscribe to the observations of learned Collector of Customs (Appeals); Karachi that the Appellant could not justify this claim with any certification from the Engineering Development Board (EDB).
7.
 In view of above, I do not find any reason, legal or factual to interfere with the impugned order-in-appeal. The same is, therefore, upheld being a lawful Order. The appeal is dismissed for lacking in merit.

2.
 Brief facts of the case as reported in the order-in-appeal are that the Appellant imported a consignment and declared to contain ""Cold rolled Steel Sheets and Coils in Secondary Quality"" and filed a Goods Declaration No.I. HC-1006244 dated 15.05.2009 under PCT heading 7209.1610 at unit value of US$ 400/PMT against Letter of Credit (L/C) No. CSLC2572/090037 dated 17.03.2000. Since, there was dispute of value, therefore, the subject goods were assessed provisionally under section 81 of the Customs Act, 1969 at US$ 494/PMT by securing differential amount of duty and taxes to the tune of Rs.1,670,596/- in shape of post dated Cheque No. 1003195 dated 28.05.2012 pending clarification from the Directorate General of Customs Valuation, Karachi. Subsequently, the Directorate General of Customs Valuation, Karachi vide letter C.No. Misc/32/2009-IVA/1255, dated 13.06.2009 directed that Contracts/LCs opened on or after 1st March, 2009 upto 31.05.2009 may be assessed as under:--

The declared value of the Appellant at US$ 400/MT was higher than the value determined by the Directorate General of Customs Valuation, Karachi vide aforesaid letter dated 13.06.2009. It is, however, admitted to the extent that the importer has approached securities section of the Collectorate for release/refund of their security (cheque), however, it was that their secured cheque was got en-cashed manually on 21.06.2012, as the provisional assessment in the instant case was made on 22.05.2009 and the time period of provisional assessment had expired much before the encashment. Subsequently, the Collectorate vide letter dated 29.04.2016 directed the importer to furnish the documents in support of his refund claim proving thereby that incidence of duty and taxes have not been passed on to the end consumer in terms of Section 19-A of the Customs Act, 1969 read with section 33 ibid. Instead of furnishing the same, the importer contested the matter vide letter dated 30.04.2016 that Section 19-A is not applicable in their case as the differential amount of duty and taxes were secured provisionally.
3.
 The adjudicating officer vide Order-in-Original No.11/2016-MCC (East) dated 22.07.2016 held that the charges against the Respondent party is proved. The operative part of the impugned order reads as under:--
 ""I have examined the record of the case. The importer was requested vide to furnish the documents in terms of Section 19-A of the Customs Act, 1969 to prove that the incidence of duties and taxes have not been passed on to the end consumer. But instead of providing the same, they have contested that application of Section 19-A is not relevant in their case. This aspect of the importer cannot be accepted. In this regard, reliance is placed on reported judgments by the Hon'ble Superior Courts i.e. in the case of Messrs Facto Belarus Tractors (2005 PTD 2286), M/s. Pak Suzuki Motor Co. Ltd. (2007 PTC 426) and Messrs Orient Colour Lab. (200 TPCT 1594), where under identical circumstances it was held that party was required to discharge its burden of proof to show that incidence has not been passed on to the end consumer, as required under section 19-A of the Customs Act, 1969. In view of the above, this office is of the considered opinion that in the instant case, the importer has passed on the incidence, of duties and taxes to the end consumer and therefore, the refund claim of the importer is rejected.""
4.
 On appeal filed by the Respondent party against the above order-in-original, the, Collector of Customs (Appeals), Karachi vide Order-in-Appeal No.1136/2016 dated 01.11.2016, passed the following order:--
 ""I have examined the record. The appellants imported CRC secondary quality vide G.D 1006244, dated 15.05.2009 at the declared transaction value of US$ 400/MT, the transaction value was not accepted and provisional determination was made under section 81 of the Customs Act, 1969 with anticipated value @ US$ 494/MT. The differential amount of duty was secured vide cheque No. 1003195. Subsequently Directorate General of Valuation vide ruling dated 13.06.2009 determined value of such goods imported against contracts/LCs between 01.03.2009 to 31.05.2009, as US$ 345/MT. The appellants declared transaction stood validated. The responding department was required to pass a final assessment order as envisaged under section 81(5) of the Act and to return the security. Later, after a time lag of three years, the cheque was encashed by the respondents. Now vide impugned order it has been held that incidence of duty and taxes was passed on by the importer. It is amazing that appellants had been only requesting release of their security furnished vide the above cheque, but the respondents have converted the same into refund claim. There was no payment made either through inadvertence, error or misconstruction. The department did not apply better judgment as how a cheque encashed in 2012 can become part of price of goods imported and sold in 2009. It is also perplexing why a cheque of three years post date was accepted, when the limitation period under section 81 could not go beyond nine months. It is evident that the order has been passed mechanically to cover up the illegal encashment of the impugned cheque. The same is held to be arbitrary and set aside. The appeal is successful.""
5.
 Being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the Order-in-Appeal, the Appellant Department filed the instant appeal before this Tribunal on the grounds, which arc reproduced as under:--
A.
 That the impugned Order-in-Appeal is ab-initio illegal, unjust and with wrong/absurd interpretation of the case, hence, liable to be set aside forthwith.
B.
 That the Order-in-Appeal has been passed without considering the view point of the department hence the same becomes ex-parte in nature. It is submitted that the Respondent No.2 decided the case in favour of the importer merely on the fabricated ground that ""appellant had been only requesting release of their security furnished vide the above cheque, but the respondent have converted the same into refund claim. There was no payment made either through inadvertence, error or misconstruction. The department did not apply better judgment as how a cheque encashed in 2012 can become part of price of goods imported and sold in 2009. It is also perplexing why a cheque of three years postdate was accepted, when the limitation period under the section 81 could not go beyond nine months. It is evident that the order has been passed Mechanically to cover up the illegal encashment of the impugned cheque. The same is held to be arbitrary and set aside"".
C.
 That the Collector (Appeal) failed to consider that under Section 19A of the Customs Act, 1969 no person qualify for refund of duty taxes unless he/she is deemed to pass on the full incident unless he proves contrary Section 19A is reproduced as under:
D.
 That it is specifically mentioned here that in an identical case Bearing No.K-1559/2016, the Honourable Member of Bench-III accepted department's point of view and dismissed the Appeal, wherein importer failed to prove that the incident of duty and taxes had not been passed on to the end consumer.
 In view of the aforesaid submissions, it is respectfully prayed that this Honorable Appellate Tribunal may be pleased to:
i.
 Declare that the impugned order is ab-initio void, illegal and therefore, liable to be set-aside.
ii.
 Declare that the provision of Section 19A is very rightly applicable in the instant case specifically in the light of Superior Courts Orders.
iii.
 Declare that the Order passed by the Adjudicating Officer was correct and in accordance with law.
6.
 The Respondent party has filed their para-wise comments on the Memo. of Appeal filed by the Appellant, which are reproduced as under:-
A.
 That the contents of ground A are vehemently denied.
B.
 That the contents of ground B are mis-stated and simply the Order-in-Appeal has been re-produced as there are no legal grounds which can cover the mis-conduct and arbitrary acts of the appellant.
C.
 That the contracts of ground C are mis-conceived as the facts and laws of the case simply proves that the instant matter was that of release of security cheque under section 81(5) of the Customs Act, 1969, as the same provisional determination was finalized in consequence to the findings by Directorate General of Customs Valuation on the specific reference by the appellant in case of the respondent No.1, and the same declared transaction value was already much higher than the ascertained by competent authority. Hence, there is no question of presumption under section 19A ibid. arise in case of release of seemity cheque.
D.
 That the contents of ground D are false, frivolous and misconceived, the undersigned counsel was also the counsel in appeal referred to in para and the same has no nexus or relation with the issue in hand. The referred appeal was against the refund application against over-payment of duty and taxes inadvertently and through error at the time of filing of G.D. Hence, the findings by this Hon'ble Tribunal in referred case has no similarity of facts and laws of the case in hand.
 It is, therefore, humbly prayed on behalf of replying respondent No. 1 that this Hon'ble Tribunal may kindly dismiss the captioned appeal with an order as to;
1)
 Declare that the presumption under section 19A of the Customs Act, 1969, does not operate in the case of release of security amount under section 81(5) against the final determination by the competent authority, as there was no payment through error, inadvertence or mis-construction;
2)
 Declare that the act of Appellant Collectorate to en-cash a security cheque after a period of more than three (03) months with fabrication is an act culpable crime under the law;
3)
 Direct the appellant to release/refund the amount against security cheque without further delaying tactics.
7.
 I have heard arguments of the learned Counsel of the Appellant as well as the learned Representative for the Respondent Department besides examining the relevant record. My observation is that the Appellant Department has complicated this case perhaps in a drive for ""earning"" revenue. As per Memo of Appeal, a post-dated cheque dated 28.05.2009 amounting to Rs.1,670,596/- was obtained by the Appellant Department from the Respondent party for securing the differential amount of duty and taxes between declared value of US$ 400/M.T and provisional assessment at US$ 494/M.T. Subsequently, the Directorate General of Customs Valuation, Karachi vide letter dated 13.06.2009 confirmed that contracts/Letter of Credits opened on or after 01.03.2009 upto 31.05.2009 may be assessed at US$ 345/M.T. The above cheque was, however, got encashed by the Appellant Department manually on 21.06.2012 as the provisional assessment was done on 22.05.2009 and the time period of provisional assessment had expired much before the encashment. The Memo. of Appeal further states that the ""Collectorate vide letter dated 29.04.2016 requested the importer to furnish the documents in support of his refund claim proving thereby that incidence of duty and taxes have not been passed on to the end consumer in terms of section 19-A read with section 33 of the Customs Act, 1969."" Here, I feel baffled to observe that instead of finalizing the provisional determination within six months, as required under section 81(2) of the Customs Act, 1969, the Appellant Department after three years encashed the post-dated cheque dated 28.05.2009 on 21.06.2012. It was mandatory on the Appellant Department to finalize assessment by 21.11.2009 as the provisional assessment was done on 22.05.2009. Infact, the said final determination could have been done much before expiry of mandatory period of six months as the Director General, Customs Valuation had decided the matter vide letter dated 13.06.2009 by advising the Appellant Department to assess the goods at value US$ 345/M.T. The aforestated position reflects that the assessment could have been finalized within one month of provisional assessment done on 22.05.2009. The Appellant Department's failure to comply with mandatory provision of law is serious omission on their part. More disturbing fact is that instead of finalizing determination and returning the amount secured in the Form of a post-dated cheque to the Respondent party, the Appellant Department encashed the post-dated cheque after about three years in 2012. In my assessment, this is height of non-professionalism and high-handedness on the part of Appellant Department.
8.
 The question of passing of incidence in terms of section 19-A of the Customs Act, 1969 is absolutely irrelevant in this context. It is important to reproduce the said provision of law which is detailed hereunder:--
 ""19A. Presumption that incidence of duty has been passed on to the buyer.---Every person who has paid the customs duty and other levies on any goods under this Act shall, unless the contrary is proved by him, be deemed to have passed on the full incidence of such customs duty and other levies to the buyer as a part of the price of such goods.""
The study of section 19-A clearly shows that it is relevant where the customs duty and other levies have been paid. In the instant case, the customs duty and taxes were not ""paid"" because the Appellant Department got from them a post-dated cheque as a security instrument so that the same could be encashed if the value was determined higher than the declared value. The matter was pending with the Appellant Department to finalize assessment as the goods had been released on provisional assessment. In this case, the Respondent party had declared value of their goods as US$ 400/M.T whereas the Directorate General, Customs Valuation advised the Appellant Department to assess the goods against US$ 345/M.T. It may be mentioned here that the security in the form of post-dated cheque was for the differential amount between US$ 400/M.T and US$ 494/M.T. This was simple preposition, therefore, Appellant Department was required to return/ refund the amount of duty and taxes worked out between US$ 345/M.T and US$ 494/M.T. Here, it is quite significant to point out that as per advice of the Director General, Customs Valuation, Karachi, two amounts were to be returned/ refunded to the Respondent party (i) difference between USD 400/M.T. and USD 494/M.T. (post-dated cheque) and (ii) difference between USD 354/M.T and USD 400/M.T as the Respondent party had deposited duty and taxes as per declared value USD 400/M.T. This process should have been completed within few days/weeks of receiving advice from the Directorate General, Customs Valuation on 13.06.2009. Here, I fully endorse views of the learned Collector of Customs (Appeals), Karachi that ""It is amazing that appellant had been only requesting release of their security furnished vide the above cheque, but the respondents have converted the same into refunds claim. There was no payment made either through inadvertence, error or misconstruction"".
9.
 The position detailed in the preceding para leads me to conclude that the Appellant Department has attended this case not only in an extremely non-professional manner but has deprived the Respondent party of his legitimate money for long (08) years for no fault of theirs which is quite disturbing and detestable. Surprizingly, the Appellant Department had enough guts to file an appeal against the lawful Order of the learned Collector, Customs (Appeal), Karachi who had appreciated this case in its true perspective. The Collector of Customs Appraisement (East), Karachi is directed to immediately return both the amounts, as mentioned in the preceding para, to the respondent party without loss of time. He is further directed to hold an inquiry into this case with a view to fix responsibility for non-professional handling of this case and unjust/ unfair treatment meted out to the respondent party for a long period of eight (08) years and take appropriate action against the delinquent officers of the Collectorate.
10.
 In view of above, the impugned order-in-appeal is upheld as a valid order. The appeal is dismissed being absolutely contrary to law and facts.

 YOUSUF ALI SAYEED, J.---
This Second Appeal impugns the Judgment dated 22.10.2015 and Decree dated 02.11.2015 passed by the learned IIIrd Additional District Judge, Karachi (Central) (the ""Appellate Judgment"") in Civil Appeal No. 86 of 2013 (the ""First Appeal""), upholding the Judgment and Decree passed on 29.05.2013 by the learned Vth Senior Civil Judge, Karachi (Central) (the ""Initial Judgment"") in Civil Suit No. 133/2010 (the ""Civil Suit"").
2.
 The dispute inter se the parties, relates to Shop Nos. 4 and 5, situated on the ground floor of a building know as Gulberg Square, situated on Sub-Plot No. ST-4/C/A, Block-16, Federal 'B' Area, Karachi (collectively, the ""Shops""), which the Respondent professes to have purchased from the Appellant in terms of Sale Agreements dated 15.07.1997 and 31.01.1998 (the ""Sale Agreements"") for a sale consideration of Rs.300,000/- and Rs.385,000/- respectively, and claims to have been put in possession thereof by the Appellant upon payment of the entire sale consideration in cash against signed receipts.
3.
 The Civil Suit was filed by the Respondent on 16.02.2010, on the basis of the respective causes of action said to arise from these Sale Agreements, and in terms of the Civil Suit the Respondent alleged having discharged his payment obligations in terms of the Sale Agreements through payments in cash and prayed inter alia for declaration of title and for specific performance as against the Appellant towards execution of sub-lease/sale deeds in respect of the Shops.
4.
 The Appellant disavowed the Sale Agreements and decried the signatures appearing thereon and on the receipts as forgeries. He denied having received any sums from the Respondent or having delivered possession of the Shops to the Respondent on the basis of any such understanding. As per the Appellant, the Respondent was his tenant and had earlier been put in possession of the Shops in that capacity pursuant to Tenancy Agreements dated 01.06.1996 and 24.01.1998. It was submitted that the Respondent had fabricated the Sale Agreements for fraudulently annexing the Shops, and that he had instituted the Civil Suit seeking specific performance accordingly.
5.
 From the pleadings of the parties in the Civil Suit, the following issues were framed:
(i)
 Whether suit is not maintainable under the law?
(ii)
 Whether Defendant had executed sale agreement dated 15.7.1997 and 31.1.1998 in favour of the Plaintiff in respect of shops/property against total consideration of Rs.675000/-
(iii)
 Whether Plaintiff has paid total sale consideration to the Defendant?
(iv)
 Whether Plaintiff was originally inducted by Defendant as tenant?
(v)
 Whether Plaintiff is entitled for the relief claimed?
(vi)
 What should be the decree?
6.
 In terms of the Initial Judgment, the finding in respect of Issues 2, 3 and 5 was returned in the affirmative and in respect of Issues 1 and 4 in the negative, all of which supported the case of the Respondent, which was then upheld in the First Appeal as per the Appellate Judgment.
7.
 Learned counsel for the Appellant submitted that the Courts below have materially erred in failing to appreciate that (a) that the disputed Sale Agreements were quite evidently dubious as the signatures said to be those of the Appellant were clearly shaky, (b) the disputed Sale Agreements remained unproven as per the requirement of law due to the fact that only one of the attesting witnesses was produced to give evidence, (c) that undue reliance was placed on the report of a handwriting expert without such report being exhibited in evidence and/or the expert being summoned, and (d) that, even otherwise, the Civil Suit, having been filed on 16.02.2010, was not maintainable in as much as the same was clearly barred by limitation as per Article 113 of the Limitation Act 1908, which prescribes three years' period of limitation for a suit for specific performance and the time begins to run from ""the date fixed for the performance, or if no such date is fixed, when the plaintiff has notice that performance is refused"".
8.
 He pointed out that the signatures on the Sale Agreements alleged to those of the Appellant visibly differed from the signatures appearing on the Tenancy Agreements, and it was evident that the same had been penned by a shaky hand. He submitted that as factum of signature was denied and the genuineness of the Sale Agreements was central to the Respondent's claim in the Civil Suit and thus formed the crux of the dispute, the onus lay on the Respondent to discharge the burden of proof by establishing that the signatures appearing thereon were those of the Plaintiff, for which purpose the persons who were shown as witnesses to the Sale Agreements were required to be examined on oath and presented for cross-examination, as prescribed by Article 79 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. He placed reliance on single-bench judgments of this Court in the cases reported as Zafar lqbal v. Sher Muhammad and 3 others 2003 YLR 673 and Maqsood Ali Khan v. M. Tehseen Khan 2003 YLR 1866. He submitted that, nonetheless, only one of the witnesses to the impugned Sale Agreements, namely Muhammad Shahzad, who is the brother-in-law of the Respondent, was called as a witness, whereas the other person shown as a witness, namely Laiq Ahmed, was never examined albeit the Respondent admitting under cross-examination that he was the occupant of the adjacent shop.
9.
 He further submitted that in ignoring the mandate of Article 79, the learned SCJ placed undue reliance on the report of a handwriting expert, albeit that the report had not been exhibited in evidence and its author had not been called to depose as an expert witness and thus be subject to cross-examination, due to which such report was of no evidentiary value. He placed reliance on the judgments of the Honourable Supreme Court in the cases reported as Allah Dino and 2 others v. Mohammad Umar and 2 others 1974 SCMR 411 and Hazara and others v. Muhammad Yar and others 2011 SCMR 758. He also pointed out that the Appellant had filed objections to the report, contending that the expert had been won over by the Respondent.
10.
 Without prejudice to his contention that the Sale Agreement remained unproven as per the mandate of law, learned counsel further submitted that the Civil Suit was even otherwise barred by limitation as the same had been filed on 16.02.2010, over 12 to 13 years after the date of the Sale Agreements, which dated back to 1997 and 1998, whereas Article 113 of Limitation Act, 1908, provided 3-years as the period of limitation for filing a suit for specific performance. He further contended that the date of refusal started from the date of first notice dated 02.05.2001, therefore, the Civil Suit was barred, having been filed after delay of about 9 years. He relied upon cases reported as Bomanshaw Burjorji Gazdar v. Mst. Mumtaz Begum and others 1985 SCMR 554, Zafar Iqbal's case (Supra) and Haji Muhammad Yaqoob through Legal Heirs v. Shah Nawaz 1998 CLC 21.
11.
 With reference to the Initial Judgment as well as the Appellate Judgment, learned counsel contended that the point of limitation had evidently been wrongly decided at both the fora below, and, in this regard, pointed out that the successive legal notices said to have been issued on behalf of the Respondent were erroneously deemed to afford a fresh cause of action and the period of limitation under Article 113 of the Limitation Act was reckoned from the date of the last such notice (i.e. 09.01.2010). He submitted that, even otherwise, no notices had even been received by the Appellant, let alone replied or acknowledged as correct, and the mere factum of issuance of such notices, even if accepted for the sake of argument, could not of itself extend the alleged cause of action for filing of the Civil Suit. He placed reliance on the judgment of the Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case reported as Messrs Anwar Textile Mills Limited v. Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited and others 2013 SCMR 1570 to show that the question of limitation remained open within the scope of a Second Appeal.
12.
 On the other hand, learned counsel for the Respondent submitted that the proceedings in the Civil Suit and the First Appeal were proper in all respects and satisfied the mandate of the law. He submitted that the evidence tendered by one of the witness to the Sale Agreements in support of the Respondent's claim in respect of the Shops coupled with the handwriting expert's report was sufficient to prove the execution and hence the authenticity of the Sale Agreements. He placed reliance on a judgment of the honourable Supreme Court reported as Ghulam Rasool and others v. Akbar Ali and others 2011 SCMR 794, as well as single bench judgments of this Court reported as Muhammad Umer and another v. The State PLD 1968 Karachi 875 and of the erstwhile Dacca High Court reported as Majarullah Mondal and others v. Matiur Rahman and others PLD 1968 Dacca 167. Furthermore, he defended the findings on the point of limitation whilst restating the very rationale applied by the Courts below.
13.
 I have examined the Initial Judgment and Appellate Judgment and considered the arguments advanced at the bar. The basis of the Respondent's claim in terms of the Civil Suit were the Sale Agreements, the execution of which had been denied by the Appellant. As such, the onus was on the Respondent to prove the same. During the course of proceedings at first instance, the Sale Agreements as well as the Tenancy Agreements placed on record by the Appellant were sent to the handwriting expert along with specimen signatures of the parties. In his report, the handwriting expert opined that the set of signatures on the Sale Agreements as well as the set of signatures on the Tenancy Agreements were similar to the specimen signatures of the Appellant. Both the courts below relied upon the expert's report despite objections raised. In defending this methodology, learned counsel for the Respondent referred to Muhammad Umer's case (supra) and Majarullah Mondal's case (Supra) in an endeavor to show that the comparison of a disputed signature with signature that are admitted is a legal mode of determining the genuineness thereof and that if, after carefully examining the disputed and admitted writings and after scrutinising the evidence of a handwriting expert, the Court is fully convinced that as to genuineness of the writing on a disputed document, there is no bar to the Court proceeding to record a finding on such a basis.
14.
 Be that as it may, from a reading of the aforementioned Judgments it is apparent that the endorsement of the legality of such an approach was circumscribed with reference to the inherent dangers of basing a decision entirely on such a comparison and from a reading of the said Judgments it appears that whilst such approach may have been considered legally permissible, it was not considered to be desirable as a matter of general practice. The learned single Judge in Majarullah Mondal's case (Supra) specifically noted that ""In certain circumstances it is unsatisfactory and dangerous to base a decision on the correct determination of the genuineness of a handwriting or a signature"", and in Muhammad Umer's case (Supra), which was a case pertaining to a criminal conviction, it was observed as follows:
""I am also of the view, if I may say so respectfully, that this evidence needs very careful examination and should also generally be supported by corroboration to be the basis of conviction in a criminal case, I have seen handwriting experts appearing on opposite sides and giving diametrically opposite opinions with regard to the same writing and supporting it with equal zeal, and force. It is for this reason that their opinion have often been described as that of a partisan or biased witness. But having said this I must add that if after carefully examining the disputed and admitted writings and after scrutinising the evidence of handwriting expert, the Court is fully convinced that the writing of the disputed documents is of the same person who wrote the admitted ones there is no bar in law to base a conviction upon such a finding.""
As such, it is apparent that whilst the evidence of a handwriting expert has its own evidentiary value, the same cannot be regarded as gospel and the Court is required to apply its mind to the controversy at hand in each case so as to properly examine and carefully consider the expert evidence, along with such corroborative evidence as may be available, so as to be convinced.
15.
 In the instant case, such caution does not appear to have been exercised, as the Sale Agreement ascribed to the Appellant visibly appears to lack a firm hand and perusal of these signatures in juxtaposition with the set of signatures on the Tenancy Agreements shows a marked and clearly discernible variation between the two sets of documents to an extent that casts an appreciable element of doubt as to the experts finding that both sets correspond with the specimen signatures of the Appellant, as it could logically only have been one or the other.
16.
 Even otherwise, it merits consideration that whilst the opinion of an expert may be of relevance as per Article 59 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, that is not to say that a report prepared by an expert would be admissible without examination of the said expert. The Honorable Supreme Court in the Allah Dino's case (Supra) held as under:--
""Mr. A.S. Pirzada, learned counsel for the appellants has submitted that this evidence is of no use because the Expert has not been examined in Court. This objection of the learned counsel appears to be well founded. I would, therefore, not take into consideration the report of the Handwriting Expert.""
On the basis of and with reference to the aforesaid principle, the apex Court held in Hazara's case (Supra) that the report of an expert as regards a thumb impression was of no help to the party seeking to rely thereon due to the non-appearance of the expert in the witness box.
17.
 Furthermore, as per the mandate of Article 79 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, the proper course to have been followed was for both witnesses to the Sale Agreements to have been produced so as to confirm the factum of execution in their presence and thus dispel the contention of the Appellant that the signatures appearing thereon were not his. The onus in this respect, as already observed, was upon the Respondent. However, this was not discharged, as only one of the witnesses was produced, and he too was admittedly a relative of the Respondent. Whilst considering this matter in the Initial Judgment it was observed by the learned civil Judge that the ""Learned counsel for plaintiff contended that the other marginal witness was not in his contact therefore, the plaintiff was not in a position to produce him in Court"". However, when this aspect is examined, it emerges that under cross-examination the Respondent had conceded that Laiq Ahmed, the witness who was not produced, was the occupant of the adjoining shop. As such, there was apparently no valid reason for him not to have been produced as per the mandatory requirement of law. Nonetheless, the learned civil Judge went on to hold that the circumstantial evidence and the expert's report were sufficient to prove the execution of the Sale Agreements. Having considered the matter, I am with utmost respect unable to agree with this finding. As previously discussed, the experts report itself lacked evidentiary value, and, if anything, the so called circumstantial evidence only served to highlight unbridged gaps in the version of the Respondent. Accordingly, I am of the opinion that the execution of the Sale Agreements was not satisfactorily proven as per the mandate of law, due to which the judgments and decrees passed by both the Courts below cannot be maintained, as per the judgment of the honourable Supreme Court reported as Rafaqat Ali and others v. Mt. Jamshed Bibi and others 2007 SCMR 1076, and the single-bench Judgments of this Court in Maqsood Ali Khan's case (Supra) as well as Zafar Iqbal's case (Supra).
18.
 Turning now to the point of limitation, from a plain reading of Article 113 it is apparent that the same conceives two situations, the first being where the date for performance is specified in the agreement, and the other where no such date is specified. Under the first part, time begins to run from the date fixed for the performance, whereas, under the second part, where no such is fixed, time begins to run from the date when the plaintiff has notice performance of the agreement is refused. Whilst, correctly observing that the Sale Agreements do not fix a specific date for performance and thus proceeding in terms of the second part, the Courts below then came to the conclusion that the Civil Suit filed by the Respondent was within time as it had been instituted in period of three years from the date of the legal notice dated 09.01.2010 said to have been addressed by him to the Appellant, which was determined in terms of the Initial Judgment and the Appellate Judgment to be the date on which the Respondent had sufficient notice that performance of the Sale Agreements was being refused. It is this aspect and the reasoning that prevailed with the Court at first instance and the first appellate Court that requires examination.
19.
 In this regard, it has to be considered that as per the Respondent, a legal notice was addressed to the Appellant on 02.05.2001 to no avail, and a reminder was then sent though counsel on 26.04.2004, but no reply was received. It is then said that on a publication being effected in a newspaper by the purchaser of some other shop in the same project in which the Shops are situated, the Respondent addressed a letter to the Appellant on 27.04.2007, in response to which the Appellant is said to assured the Respondent as to completion of performance during the first week of January 2010. It is said that upon the failure of the Appellant to fulfil such commitment, the counsel of the Respondent addressed yet another legal notice dated 09.01.2010 to the Appellant, which again remained unreplied. It is this notice that has been treated by the Court below as the date of commencement of the period of limitation under Article 113.
20.
 It has to be considered that having denied the execution of the Sale Agreements, the Appellant had also denied knowledge of the notices said to have been addressed by the Respondent, and, indeed, no proof of despatch/receipt was provided by the Respondent and no correspondence was placed on record to indicate any acknowledgment on the part of the Appellant as to the existence of the Sale Agreements or acceptance of any obligation in respect of the Shops. As such, there is no foundation to support the finding of a continuing series of causes of action. In the case of Bomanshaw Burjorji Gazdar (Supra) a notice calling upon a part to perform a contract, when remaining unacknowledged, was considered by the honourable Supreme Court as sufficient to put the sender on notice that performance was being refused. Furthermore, in Zafar Iqbal's case (Supra), the conduct of a party in failing to perform the agreement upon being approached to do so was considered to constitute sufficient notice to the counter-party seeking performance that the same was being refused. As per the reported facts, the latter case appears to have been the mirror image of the matter at hand as regards the aspect of limitation, in as much as the suit in that case had been held to be barred under Article 113, and such finding had been upheld in appeal. In proceedings in revision under section 115, C.P.C. it was contended that as no specific date had been prescribed for performance, the case fell under the second part of Article 113, and as performance had not been specifically refused and the applicant had been kept on hopes therefore the limitation period did not start running. It is in this context that the learned single Judge made the aforementioned observation, which in my view would be squarely applicable as regards the case set up by the Respondent in the Civil Suit. Thus, in my view, under the given circumstances and in light of the aforementioned precedents, the period of limitation as per Article 113 began to run as against the Respondent from date of the legal notice dated 02.05.2001 and the Civil Suit was thus clearly barred by limitation.
21.
 In view of the foregoing, it is evident that judgments of the Courts below cannot be sustained and this Second Appeal thus succeeds with the result that the Appellate Judgment and Initial Judgment are set aside, and consequently any benefit derived by the Respondent thereunder in respect of title to the Shops is also set aside and is to be reverted/restored to the Appellant.
22.
 This Second Appeal is allowed in the above terms.

 Appeal allowed."

 MOHAMMAD IBRAHIM KHAN, J.---
Ameer Jan and 17 others Petitioners herein, are imploring the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court setting their prayer as follows:-
""It is, therefore, humbly prayed that (on) acceptance of this writ petition, the Respondents may please be graciously directed to install electric poles and lay transmission line in village common land instead of thickly populated area or across the river in barren area; they may also be graciously refrain from carrying out any sort of work in our properties without acquisition process and compensation according to the market value as per law.
Any other relief which this august Court deems fit and appropriate may also be graciously granted.
2.
 Brief but necessary facts as deciphered from the record are that Petitioners claimed to be owners in possession of properties bearing Khasra Nos. 1026, 1028, 1031, 1193, 1215, 1216, 1234, 1237 and 1251 situated within the local limits of Satal Ghari Tehsil Behrain District Swat. The Sarhad Hydal Development Organization (SHYDO) ""the Employer"" had executed a contrast with SINOTEC-SHPE-GRS ""the Contractor"" on 11.04.2012, wherein the latter was bound to carry-out certain assigned works i.e. designing, manufacturing, testing, delivering, installing, procurement and construction of Daral Khwar Hydro Power Project. Thereafter, the Provincial Government acquired the land through PHYDO Department by way of mutation Nos. 1484 and 312 dated 30.05.2012 for the construction of power house, access road and site for water storage. The compensation in lieu of acquired land has been distributed amongst land affectees.
3.
 In the meanwhile, the Respondents Nos.1 to 5 have stated installation of electric poles and they are lying transmission lines from Power House Daral Khwar Hydro Power Project to Grid Station Madyan. The said Power House would generate power of 36 Megawatt. Likewise the power house currently under construction at Matiltan would generate electricity up to 84 Megawatt and power/energy of both these power houses would run through the proposed transmission lines. With adding information that each electric pole would be installed over an area of 60 x 60 sqt. i.e. 13.2 marlas. However, the Provincial Government has neither acquired the properties of the Petitioners nor any compensation has been paid to them. In the meanwhile, the Respondents Nos.1 to 8 have diverted the transmission line due to political pressure at some places and instead of following straight route they are installing the transmission lines in zigzag path. Besides the Respondents have malafidely left out the village common land (""Shamilat"") and are carrying-out installation of transmission line in the properties of the Petitioners. The Petitioners have also raised concern that the Respondents instead of installing transmission lines across the river, which is obviously less populated area, rather carry-out the said work in the built up area without advancing any plausible reason in this regard. In this behalf, the Petitioners have moved several applications to the concerned quarter i.e. Respondent No. 2 for redressal of their grievances, but of no avail, hence, the present writ petition has been preferred inter-alia on the grounds mentioned from (a) to (e).
4.
 Comments were called from the Respondents Nos.1 and 2, who submitted accordingly, wherein it has been mentioned that the design, procurement and construction of Daral Khwar Hydropower Project (HPP) has been undertaken by the Government of Pakhtunkhwa Energy Development Organization (PEDO)/Energy and Power Department Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. A consortium comprising International and National Contractors has been selected for the construction of the project. With adding information that Daral Khwar HPP is a project of National interest which is in the final stage of its completion. This project will not only be a great source of energy to the National Grid but it will also generate revenue for the local community in shape of 10% Royalty. It has been further enumerated therein that the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa through PEDO/E&P Department has acquired the land with the help of Local Administration as per spirit of the Land Acquisition Act. According to law, no permanent Land Acquisition is required for transmission of lines as very small pieces of lands are required for this purpose, however compensation for standing crops and trees, if any, in the land at the foundations of towers is paid and for this purpose with the coordination of Local Administration at Behrain the project management PEDO and Project consultants have submitted assessment compensation report to the tune of Rs.33,00,000/-. The Respondents further submitted that in the interest of the locals and to minimize the effects on the local area, the transmission line from Gorkin-Matiltan HPP Will be terminated in Daral Khwar HPP Power House at Behrain and both the projects will be carried through single transmission line from Behrain to Madyan Grid Station.
5.
 Having heard arguments of learned counsel for the parties, available record with their valuable assistance gone through.
6.
 Learned counsel for the Petitioners relied on (2007 MLD 1998) ""Kadir Baksh v. Chairman WAPDA and others"", PLD 1994 Supreme Court 639 ""Mst. Shehla Zia and others v. WAPDA, besides also submitted written arguments for assistance of the Court and prayed for the acceptance of the present writ petition as valuable rights of his clients i.e. Petitioners are at stake by way of compensation of their lands. Inversely learned counsel for the Respondents referred to (PLD 1991 Supreme Court 715) ""Malik Haji Nazar Muhammad and another v. WAPDA and another"", (PLD 2002 Lahore 28), ""Hakim Ali v. Member Power WAPDA and others"" (PLD 1993 Lahore 237) ""Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority v. Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission Employees Cooperative Housing Society and others"", (PLD 1992 Peshawar 76) Umer Gul v. Malik Abdul Manan"" and (2013 SCMR 1752) Contempt of Court proceedings against Chief Secretary Sindh and others"" and prayed for utter dismissal of the petition being shorn of merits.
7.
 The learned counsel for the Petitioners has shared his valuable knowledge in view of the dictums highlighted earlier. Under the grounds taken in the memo. of his Petition having been moved an application before the Respondent No.13 on 29.9.2016 to the effect that the Petitioners are owners of the survey numbers mentioned therein. They have prayed for non-installation of the electric poles in their owned and possessed lands instead a proposal was given to carry-out the installation in the Shamilati land, which was under the scheduled PC-1, in this way the Petitioner will not suffer extensive damage in respect of their owned and possessed properties. If otherwise their prayer is not accorded then as an alternate remedy they are entitled to compensation in shape of award of acquisition of their lands under the Land Acquisition Act through Local Administration and in this behalf the Assistant Commissioner Behrain shall hold a thorough inquiry.
8.
 The petition under narration of facts at Serials 8 and 9 has paramount importance, it seems otherwise while the Respondents have carried-out their 95% work of installation of towers for the purpose of supply then the given prayer of the Petitioners with regard to restraining the Respondents from installation of transmission lines will have absolutely no force. The Respondents have spent huge finances in billions but at least in return the Petitioners may be compensated in terms of a prayer for award for the market value of their lands if at all such lands are directly affected from installation of the towers that is why great emphasis has been made on facts at Serials 8 and 9 the Petition. Para No. 8 speaks of ""that the Respondents are about to install electric poles on the valuable properties of the Petitioners without being acquired or compensated the land affectees."" Likely Para No. 9 reveals ""that the Respondents may graciously be restrained from carrying out illegal and unlawful work without acquisition and compensation on the following grounds.""
9.
 As far as the earlier prayer for consideration upraising of towers in the Shamilati lands or across the river, it is manifestly clear that this period within structure is over as there are only few poles/towers which are to be hoisted so to carry out the entire work for smooth supply and running of power in lines. While dealing with the prayer for compensation it is valid for this purpose in accordance with the comments furnished an amount of Rs. 33,00,000/- has already been reserved and even under the finance program further amount can be arranged if the acquisition process is carried-out and values of the properties that are to be affected the award is determined. The Pukhtunkhwa (Energy) Development Organization Act, 1993 cast upon this organization to have process and obligations of licensee under Electricity Act, 1910 as per section 14 of the ibid Act;-
""Organization to have powers and obligations of licensee under Electricity Act, 1910.- - - The organization shall, for the purposes of the, Electricity Act, 1910, be deemed to be a licensee and shall have the powers and discharge all the obligations of a licensee under the said Act;
Provided that nothing in sections 3 to 11, subsections (2) and (3) of section 21 and sections 22, 23 and 27 of the said Act, or in clauses I to XII of the Schedule to the said Act, relating to the duties and obligations of a licensee shall apply to the Organization.""
 Section 15 pertains to Powers regarding certain matters. Its subsection (2) clause (b) empowers the organization;-
 a .
b. Acquire by purchase, lease, exchange or otherwise and dispose of by sale, lease, exchange or otherwise, [any immovable property or any interest in such property];
 The attached subsection (3) provides mode and manners Under Land Acquisition Act, 1894 it says,-
""The acquisition of any land or any interest in land for the Organization under this section, or of any scheme under this Act, shall be deemed to 'be an acquisition for a public purpose within the meaning of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, and the provisions of the said Act shall apply to all such proceedings.""
 This Act of the year i.e. The Pakhtunkhwa [Energy] Development Organization Act, 1993 highlights section 16 subsection 2(b) as,-
""Right of entry. ------------
Provided that when the affected land does not vest in the Organization the power conferred by this subsection shall be exercised in such manner as to cause least damage to the rights of the owner thereof.""
 10.
 In order to initiate the process for determination of the price of lands coming under the elevation of towers owned by the affectees/Petitioners there may be an earlier acquisition process for a definite award strictly in terms of the market rate. It is pertinent to mention here that the Interim Relief granting order handed down by this Court on 16.01.2017 is hereby recalled.
11.
 In such setting of the terms, this writ petition is disposed of accordingly.

 Order accordingly."
29,"MUHAMMAD AFZAL Versus JUDGE FAMILY COURT","June 12, 2017","LAHORE HIGH COURT LAHORE"," Honorable Justice Jawad Hassan ","2018 CLC 801","JUDGMENT
 JAWAD HASSAN, J.---
 Through this Constitutional Petition, the Petitioner has called in question orders dated 19.03.2016 and 22.11.2016 passed by the learned Executing Court, Gujranwala.
2.
 Facts briefly for the disposal of this Constitutional Petition are that as a consequence of suit for maintenance and recovery of dowry articles Judgment and Decree dated 16.05.2013 (the ""Judgment and Decree"") was passed by Judge Family Court, Gujranwala, whereby the Respondent No.2, was not held entitled to get maintenance allowance beside this she was entitled to get dowry articles or in the alternate value of Rs.1,50,000/-. The said Judgment and Decree was assailed by the Respondent No.2, which was partially allowed vide judgment dated 18.03.2015 (the ""Appellate Judgment"") with modification whereby she was deserved entitled to get maintenance allowance at the rate of Rs.4000/- per month subject to performance of her matrimonial obligations and not otherwise. The said judgment and decree was not further assailed before the higher forum. However, during pendency of execution proceedings, the learned Executing Court vide order dated 19.03.2016 observed that since Talaq has been effected on 30.11.2015, therefore, judgment debtor/Petitioner is under legal obligation to pay maintenance till 30.11.2015. Subsequently, the learned Executing Court on 2.11.2016 passed the order, whereby the Respondent No.2 was entitled to recover her arrears of maintenance allowance from the period of 16.05.2013 to 30.11.2015 (the ""Impugned Orders""), which is beyond the Judgment and Decree. Hence this petition.
3.
 Learned counsel for the Petitioner has argued that Impugned Orders have been passed by learned Executing Court in an arbitrary manner as the Executing Court had no jurisdiction to go beyond the decree. He has further argued that Executing Court has no jurisdiction to modify the Judgment and Decree. Lastly, he prayed for setting aside of the said Impugned Orders.
4.
 On the other hand counsel for the Respondent No.2 has supported the Impugned Orders and contended that Impugned Orders passed by the learned Executing Court are inline with the Appellate Judgment passed by the learned Additional District Judge, therefore, no exception can be taken to it. Lastly, he prayed for dismissal of the writ petition.
5.
 Arguments heard and record perused.
6.
 It is reflected from perusal of record that pivotal question to be determined by this Court is whether the learned Executing Court, Gujranwala was justified to pass an order in execution proceedings, which was not passed in Judgment and Decree out of which execution proceedings were arisen. In order to resolve this issue, it is pertinent to mention and reproduce the Appellate Judgment of the learned Additional District Judge, Gujranwala, the relevant extract whereof is reproduced hereunder:-
""15.
 So far as maintenance allowance of the appellant is concerned, it is submitted that wife is entitled to get maintenance only when she is performing the matrimonial obligations but in the present case, she is not performing the matrimonial obligations because admittedly, criminal litigation is pending between the parties, even otherwise at the time of pre-trial reconciliation proceedings, she made statement before the court that she does not want to reconcile with the respondent, even during the cross-examination, she refused to live with the respondent, therefore, learned trial court rightly disentitled her from past maintenance allowance. However, as marriage inter se the spouses is still intact and she is still legal wedded wife of the respondent, therefore, she deserves maintenance allowance at the rate of Rs.4000/- per month subject to perform her matrimonial obligations not otherwise.""
7.
 It is evident from the record that during the execution proceedings, the Executing Court went beyond its jurisdiction and passed the Impugned Orders not warranted by law. The relevant extract from the said order is reproduced hereunder:-
""File has been perused. Interim order dated 19.03.2016 reveals that divorce has been effected on 30.11.2015 and my learned predecessor court has ordered the payment of decretal amount under the ambit of conditional maintenance allowance holder. Same order has not been challenged and attained finality. In the larger interest of justice, decree holder is held entitled to recover her arrears of maintenance allowance from the period of 16.05.2013 to 30.11.2013. Judgment debtor is bound to pay the arrears of monthly maintenance allowance to decree holder.""
8.
 From the perusal of above order it reveals that said order was a conditional order and could only be enforced and executed if the condition imposed in the said order was fulfilled, but from the perusal of above said order it transpires that the Respondent No.2 categorically denied to rehabilitate with the Petitioner and to perform her matrimonial obligations, therefore, passing of said order in such circumstances was not justified, perverse and contrary to the dictates of Apex Courts. So far as Executing Court whose orders are impugned in this Court is concerned, it also acted beyond its jurisdiction and passed the orders in jurisdiction not vested in it. The Executing Court cannot go beyond the decree and it has to execute the decree in the manner in which the decree has been passed. Reliance in this respect is placed upon Sardar Ahmed Yar Khan Jogezai and 2 others v. Province of Balochistan through Secretary, C&W Department (2004 SCMR 122), wherein it has been held as under:-
""Executing Court at the time of execution of the decree, modified the decree by changing the rate of interest specified in the decree. Substitution of amendment could not have been made by the Executing Court as the same amounted to attempt to frustrate the object of the judgment and decree which had already attained finality. Such order passed by the Executing Court was arbitrary, capricious and coram non judice. Executing Court could not be go behind the decree. When decree passed attained finality, it had got to be executed even if it was erroneously passed. Executing Court could not rectify any mistake in decree which would tantamount to going behind the decree.""
Although the Petitioner had not challenged the Appellate Judgment of Additional District Judge, Gujranwala, but it does not give power to the Executing Court to pass an order in the executing proceedings not warranted by law, which go beyond the decree.
9.
 In view of the above and by relying on the Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in `Ahmad Yar Khan Jogezai' case supra, this petition is allowed and Impugned Orders are set aside and learned Executing Court is directed to implement the Appellate Judgment of the learned Additional District Judge in its true sense and perspective manner.

 WAQAR AHMAD SETH, J.---
On his failure to obtain bail from the learned Judge Anti Terrorism Court, Peshawar vide order dated 08.04.2017, petitioner Muhammad Khalid who is accused in case FIR No. 368 dated 08.07.2014, under sections 302, 324, 148, 149, P.P.C., Police Station Sarband, Peshawar, has come to this Court for his release on bail.
2.
 Arguments of learned counsel for the parties heard and available record perused with their able assistance.
3.
 It appears from the record available on file that in this case the occurrence took place on 08.07.2014 at 2140 hours, while the report has been lodged on the same date at 2340 hours. Feroz Shah is the complainant of present case, and he has charged the unknown culprits initially, but, later on vide his statement recorded on 16.03.2017 under section 164, Cr.P.C. he nominated the accused/petitioner Muhammad Khalid for the murder of Faisal and Hayat Muhammad, however, in the FIR affective role of firing has been attributed to unknown persons. Here this aspect of the case cannot be overruled that the occurrence took place on 08.07.2014, while complainant charged the accused/ petitioner in his statement recorded on 05.01.2015 which is after lapse of 05 months and 27 days. Similarly other injured persons also charged the accused/ petitioner in their statement recorded on 16.03.2017 and 'that too' after long considerable delay of 02-Years, 08 Months and 08-days, on the basis of developed false story. 
4. 
 Moreover, in the present case the 4 occurrence took place on 08.07.2014 at 2140 hours, whereas, the report has been lodged on the same date at 2340 hours. On the face of it there is considerable delay of two hours in lodging the FIR by the respondent/complainant who was present with the deceased at the time of ( ).
5.
 From the perusal of record it reveals that in the FIR no one was charged by name. No doubt in the present incident five persons sustained injuries and two were died, but, even then the injury on their persons do not commensurate with the number of accused who as per version of the prosecution were armed with Kalashnikovs and that on seeing them they all started indiscriminate firing with intention to kill them and which fact alone takes their case to that of further enquiry, because except these statements there is nothing on record to connect him with the crime. Neither recovery/discovery was affected from the accused/petitioner nor he confessed his guilt before competent authority.
6.
 In view of the facts and circumstances of the case, there is scope of further inquiry into the guilt of the accused/petitioner. Therefore bail petition in hand is accepted and the accused/ petitioner is admitted to bail provided that he furnishes bail bonds to the tune of Rs. 5,00,000/- with two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the learned trial Court.

 Above were the reasons of short order of even date.

 MUHAMMAD SALEEM JESSAR, J.---
Applicant Zameer Bohio is an accused of Crime No.17/2017 registered with Police. Station Hingorja under sections 427, 379, P.P.C.; is aggrieved by the order dated 02.05.2417 whereby learned Magistrate by concurring his opinion with police report viz second investigation has accepted the challan; took cognizance of the case and ordered for issuance of NBWs against absconder accused while notice to present applicant and co-accused Abdul Latif and Nazeer who have been granted bail by the competent Court of law having jurisdiction.
2.
 The crux of prosecution case, as unfolded by Raheem Bux Sahito in his FIR No.17/2017, are that he has obtained the land on lease in which mustard crop and live trees of acacia are standing. On fateful day he was available at his land where accused Zameer Hussain (present applicant), 2. Abdul Lateef, 3. Nazeer, 4. Shareef Bhutto along with two unknown accused, duly armed with pistols, were cutting the standing trees of acacia with cutter and hatchets and stolen away by keeping pieces of trees on donkey cart within their sight. Due to weapons the complainant party could not resist and remained mum. Later they noticed three trees were cut off and stolen away and due to falling down of the trees, the standing crop had also sustained damages. The complainant narrated above facts to one Mumtaz Hussain Sahito, Nekmard of his village, who asked that he would try to get stolen trees returned or may hold Faisla but accused did not turn at the call of Nekmard and ultimately on his advise present FIR was lodged.
3.
 After registration of case police took-up investigation, during the investigation instant case was found false therefore police have disposed of FIR under false 'B' Class with such recommendation, the papers were submitted before learned Magistrate. The learned Magistrate after scrutinizing the investigation papers did not agree with police report and directed the SSP concerned to conduct fresh/second investigation into the allegations contained in FIR by his order dated 29.03.2017. In compliance of his order the matter was reinvestigated and the charge-sheet dated 26.04.2017 in terms of section 173, Cr.P.C. was submitted by the I.O. before the concerned Court having jurisdiction. The learned Magistrate after accepting the challan/charge-sheet took cognizance of the case vide impugned order dated 02.05.2017 and the case against the applicant and others was instituted being Crl. Case No.68/2017 re-State v. Zameer Hussain and others.
4.
 Learned counsel for the applicant states that the FIR, lodged by complainant, is false one and prior to this he had filed 02 FIRs against the accused in which, he has been acquitted. He further submits that there is civil litigation pending between the parties and therefore instant case is nothing but to exert illegal pressure upon the accused so that they may withdraw from their case. He further submits that the I.O. had disposed of the FIR under false 'B' Class and recommended for initiation of proceedings under section 182, P.P.C. against the complainant. The second I.O. has found the accused to be offender, submitted challan and after challan, trial Court has taken cognizance of the case. He further prays for quashment of the proceedings culminating from Crime No.17/2017 of Police Station, Hingorja.
5.
 On the other hand learned DPG for the State along with second I.O. Muhammad Ameen Pathan is present and states that the case filed by complainant was genuine one and the applicant was found culprit of the crime as alleged in the FIR, therefore I.O. has charge-sheeted him. He further submits that the trial Court has taken cognizance therefore, best course for the applicant is to face trial instead of pressing instant proceedings.
6.
 I have heard counsel for the applicant and learned DPG for the State and have also gone through the material available on record.
7.
 At the very outset, I would say that the inherent jurisdiction, as provided under section 561-A, Cr.P.C., is not an alternate or an additional jurisdiction but it is a jurisdiction preserved in the interest of justice to redress wrong for which no other procedure is available or has been provided by the code itself. Reference may be made to the case of Asfandyar and another v. Kamran and another 2016 SCMR 2084 wherein it is held as:
""The remedy under section 561-A, Cr.P.C. is not an alternate or substitute for an express remedy as provided under the law in terms of sections 435 to 439 Cr.P.C. Jurisdiction under section 561-A, Cr.P.C. is neither alternative nor additional in its nature and is to be rarely invoked only to secure the end of justice so as to seek redress of grievance for which no other procedure is available.""
I would also add that normally, every case is to be allowed to proceed according to law and resort to the provision of section 561-A, Cr.P.C. should be avoided particularly where the relief, sought through this course, has been provided by the Code itself as it would tend to circumvent the due process of law which has never been the intention of law. However, I would not hesitate in saying. that this remedy however would be available only in exceptional cases i.e. where insisting upon normal procedure/course may amount to continuity of an illegality or may be an injustice such as a case of abduction where abductee himself/herself denies to have been abducted and apprehends arm in approaching to trial Court. Reference may be made to the case of Ghulam Muhammad v. Muzamil Khan and 4 others PLD 1967 SC 317.
""The inherent jurisdiction given by section 561-A, Cr.P.C. is not an alternative jurisdiction or an additional jurisdiction but it is jurisdiction preserved in the interest of justice to redress grievances for which no other procedure is available or has been provided by code itself. The powers given by this Section can certainly not be so utilized as to interrupt or divert the ordinary code of criminal procedure as laid down in the procedural statute. The High Court should be extremely reluctant to interfere in a case here a competent Court has, after examining the evidence adduced before it, come to the view that a prima facie case is disclosed and has framed charges or summoned the accused to appear, unless it can be said that the charge on its face or the evidence, even if believed, does not disclose any offence.""
8.
 Reference may also be made to Muhammad Khalid Mukhtar v. The State through Deputy Director F.I.A. (PLD 1997 SC 275) and Shaikh Mahmood Saeed and others v. Aamir Nawaz Khan and another 1996 SCMR 839 on the point that this Court would be reluctant to quash the proceedings under section 561-A, Cr.P.C. unless the Court is approached for, that exercise of it's powers under section 249-A or 265-K, Cr.P.C. which are incidentally at the same nature and in a way akin to and co-relating with quashing of proceedings and that resort to the provisions of section 561-A, Cr.P.C. should not be lightly made as same would tend to circumvent the due process of law. Reference can be taken from the case of Shevo v. Regional Police Officer Hyderabad Region Hyderabad and 15 others (PLD 2009 Kar. 24) and the dictum laid down by Honourable Supreme Court in case of Director City Circle GEPCO Ltd. and others v. Shahid Mir and others (PLD 2013 SC 403).
9.
 In the instant case, the applicant's counsel has neither mentioned nor stated that before approaching this court under section 561-A, Cr.P.C. he has approached the trial Court for getting his early acquittal under section 249-A, Cr.P.C. which remedy is analogous to the one, sought through the instant petition. The applicant should have approached trial Court and thereafter, criminal revisional Court if no relief was granted by the trial Court in the first instance under the code of criminal procedure before approaching High Court directly which in the circumstances of case could not be said to be proper as it would amount to diverting and interrupting ordinary course, provided by the Code of criminal procedure.
10.
 The crux and upshot of above discussion is that since after second investigation challan has been submitted by the I.O. and learned Magistrate has taken cognizance of the case therefore quashment of proceedings directly by this Court would tantamount to interruption in ordinary legal course particularly in presence of alternate remedy available to. the applicant in terms of section 249-A, Cr.P.C. I would also add here that second investigation is not barred under the law and difference of opinion (s) of I.Os. of two investigation alone cannot be a ground for an early acquittal but it shall always be the material, so brought onto the record by the Investigation because the Courts should not be influenced from ipse dixit of police which otherwise is not binding upon Magistrate as well trial Court. Thus, recommendation of the case for its disposal under false 'B-class' was/is is no legal weight when the same stood changed by Investigation authority itself. Reference may be made to the case of Raja Khurshid Ahmed v. Muhammad Bilal and others 2014 SCMR 474 wherein it is held as:--
""5. It would be seen that as per settled law there is no bar to the reinvestigation of a criminal case and the police authorities are at liberty to file a supplementary challan even after submission of the final report under section 173, Cr.P.C. However, this cannot be done after the case has been disposed of by the learned trial Court.
Further, there has been placed nothing on record which could be taken as an exception for allowing deviation to normal procedure. The plea (s) of pending civil litigation and even lodgment of criminal cases against each other are not the grounds to plainly declare an allegation as false but may well be taken as defence which too at proper stage of trial. While exercising inherent jurisdiction this Court never dresses itself as that of trial Court but can well be exercised where continuity of a complained proceedings prima facie, without much deliberation, appears to be on illegality or injustice. The allegations contained in FIR cannot be properly threshed out as controversy requires evidence hence cannot be resolved by this Court through instant proceedings. I would now add that insist to adopt normal procedure has been for a reason because inherent jurisdiction of this Court under section 561-A, Cr.P.C. is not analogous to that of trial Court or Magistrate concerned who otherwise are competent to examine all the available material while this Court only has to see prima facie illegality resulting or likely to result into injustice. The legal position of the case is that it is primarily domain of learned trial Court who took cognizance and can properly adjudicate upon the factual controversy emanating from the allegations mentioned in the FIR which is ultimate and proper forum for finally deciding the case on its own merits. Thus, the honourable Supreme Court in a case of Director General, Anti-Corruption Estt. v. Muhammad Akram Khan PLD 2013 SC 401 categorically has held as:--
""2 . The law is quite settled by now that after taking of cognizance of a case by a trial court the FIR registered in that case cannot be quashed and the fate of the case and of the accused persons challaned therein is to be determined by the trial court itself. It goes without saying that if after taking of cognizance of a case by the trial court an accused person deems himself to be innocent and falsely implicated and he wishes to avoid the rigours of a trial then the law has provided him a remedy under sections 249-A/265-K, Cr.P.C. to seek his premature acquittal if the charge against him is groundless or there is no probability of his conviction.
11.
 The applicant has prima facie by-passed the ordinary legal course available to him, provided under the criminal procedure code, and since there has been placed no exceptional circumstances to justify departure from normal course hence in absence thereof inherent powers under section 561-A, Cr.P.C. cannot be exercised which otherwise would amount to interrupt and divert the ordinary code of criminal procedure. The applicant can agitate, the same plea before the trial court. In the circumstances, this criminal miscellaneous application is incompetent, which is hereby dismissed leaving the applicant to agitate his remedy before the trial Court which (trial Court) would pass an appropriate order within four corners of law.

32,"KHAMISO Versus State","June 9, 2017","FEDERAL SHARIAT COURT"," Honorable Justice Mrs. Ashraf Jahan ","2017 PLD 98","JUDGMENT
 MRS ASHRAF JAHAN, J:-
 The above titled criminal appeal was disposed of vide short order dated 07.06.2017 which reads as under:
""Heard learned counsel for the appellant and the learned Prosecutor General Sindh for the State. For reasons to be recorded later, Criminal Appeal No.17/K of 2016 is allowed. The Judgment dated 30.06.2015 passed by the learned 2nd Additional Sessions Judge Sanghar is set aside so also the conviction and sentence awarded to appellant Khamiso S/o Pir Dino Khaskheli and he is acquitted of the charges. He may be released forthwith if not required in any other custody case"".
 Following are the reasons of the above order.
2.
 The appellant Khamiso through this Criminal Appeal has assailed the judgment dated 30.06.2015 passed by the learned 2nd Additional Sessions Judge Sanghar, whereby he was convicted and sentenced under Section 392 P.P.C. for Seven years' R.I. and to pay fine of Rs.10000/-; in case of default in payment of fine to suffer S.I. for three months. He was also sentenced under Section 342 P.P.C. to suffer R.I. for one year and to pay fine of Rs.3000/-, in default thereof to suffer S.I. for one month. The Sentences awarded to him were ordered to run concurrently.
3
 The facts as narrated in the F I R by complainant Ali Hassan are that his uncle Moula Bux owned a Datsun vehicle bearing Registration No.BHB:1754, which was driven by him, and Nabi Bux Khaskheli was its Cleaner. On 12.05.2012 in the evening he was asked by Ustad Muhammad Bachal Malokhani to take ten cooked cauldrons for delivery in marriage ceremony at Tando Adam. At about 6.00 p.m. he took food from Otaq of Rehan Talpur and proceeded towards Tando Adam. At about 1200 hours they were on their way back in Datsun along with empty cauldrons, when at 0100 hours they reached near Suhni Dharti Bus Stop Road, suddenly four culprits armed with weapons intercepted them. They snatched keys of Datsun and robbed Cell Phones from the complainant and Cleaner. They were with open faces and two black colour motorcycles of culprits were also parked there. The culprits took them towards sugarcane crops and tied their hands and legs. One of the culprits started Datsun pick up while three drove away on their motorcycles and all went towards Tando Adam side. At about 0400 hours the complainant and Cleaner untied themselves and came to main road from where they took lift in a truck and reached home. They disclosed above story to their uncle Moula Bux and relative Mumtaz and kept on searching the robbers. During search they came to know that Haroon Majeedano, Lakhadino Majeedano, Ghaffar Majeedano and Khamiso Khaskheli had robbed Datsun along with other articles. They made complaint to Dadlo Majeedano and lnayat Majeedano, who ensured them to settle the issue and return robbed articles but finally on 16.08.2012 they refused to return the robbed property. Thereafter on 17.08 2012 complainant lodged the F I R. at Police Station Jhol, District Sanghar. Police after usual investigation submitted challan before the Court of law against accused Dadlo and lnayat while showing four accused as absconders. Subsequently accused Khamiso was arrested while the rest of the accused were declared as proclaimed offenders.
4
 Charge in the present crime was framed against accused Dadlo, lnayat Ali and Khamiso on 31.12.2012 for offences punishable under Section 17(3) Offences Against Property (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979 and Section 342 P.P.C.to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
5
 Prosecution in support of its case examined complainant Ali Hassan as Ex.11 who produced F.I.R. as Ex.11/A. PW-2 Nabi Bux as Ex. 12 P.W. Moula Bux as Ex.13. At this stage an application under Section 227 Cr.P.C was moved by DDPP for amendment in the charge which was allowed and Amended Charge was framed on 16.04.2017 wherein Section 212 P.P.C. was added. Prosecution further examined PW.4 Anwar Sadat as Ex.20. Investigation officer of this case Additional SHO Arbab Ali was examined as Ex.21, who produced Mushirnama in respect of documents of Datsun as Ex.21/A, Mushirnama of Sarzamin as Ex.21/B. PW-6 Mumtaz Ali was examined as Ex.22. Thereafter prosecution closed its side vide statement dated 07.04.2015 as Ex.23.
6.
 Statements of all three accused were recorded under Section 342 Cr.P.C., wherein they denied allegations leveled by the Prosecution side, however, they neither examined themselves on oath nor any witness in their defence.
7.
 The Trial Court after completion of trial passed the judgment dated 30.06.2015 which is impugned before this Court, whereby the present appellant was convicted, while two accused Dadlo and lnayat were acquitted extending them benefit of doubt.
8
 I have heard Mr. Nadir M. Abro Advocate appearing for the appellant as well as Mr. Zahoor Shah, Assistant Prosecutor General Sindh, for the State. It is contended by learned counsel for the appellant that there are mere words of complainant Ali Hassan against the present appellant. Even the eye-witness PW-Nabi Bux did not identify him as culprit of this crime; most importantly there is inordinate delay in lodging of F.I.R. without any reasonable justification: there is no recovery from the present appellant. Thus the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the charge against him, therefore, the present appeal may be allowed in the interest of justice.
9
 Conversely, it is argued by the learned State Counsel that though there is evidence of PW-Ali Hassan against the present appellant but at the same time there is no corroboratory piece of evidence against appellant to connect him with the commission of crime.
10.
 I have considered the arguments and have perused the record. It is apparent on the face of record that there is inordinate delay in lodging the F.I.R. in the present crime. As per prosecution itself the incident had taken place on 13.05.2012 in the early hours of the night but F.I.R. was lodged on 17.08.2012, after delay of more than three months, for which no plausible explanation is assigned except the words that complainant was searching the culprits, made complaint to Dadlo Majeedano and lnayat Majeedano, who initially promised for return of robbed vehicle but finally refused to return the same. As per prosecution story there were four culprits at the time of incident but challan was produced against six persons. No doubt that complainant in his evidence before Court has nominated present appellant with the commission of crime but the other eye-witness PW- Nabi Bux who was with the complainant at the time of incident did not identify him as accused. This piece of evidence is a major blow to the case of prosecution.
11.
 Further when the evidence of complainant is examined minutely, it clearly reveals that though in the F.I.R. he alleged that the culprits had also snatched two Q-Mobile Phones from the complainant party besides the Datsun and ten empty cauldrons but in his evidence before Court his statement is totally silent about snatching of mobile phones. Similarly, PW Nabi Bux also did not adduce a single word about alleged robbed mobile phones.
12.
 Another important aspect of the case is that there is no recovery from the appellant in this crime. Thus it is significant that there is no corroboratory piece of evidence in support of the words of complainant against the appellant connecting him with commission of crime. 
13.
 It is pertinent to note that in F.I.R. the complainant reported that he approached Dadlo Majeedano and lnayat Majeedano, who assured to settle the dispute and return of vehicle but in his evidence he did not depose a single word against them and deposed that accused Lakhadino kept him on false hopes and after three months refused to return the vehicle, which compelled him to lodge the F.I.R. He attributed only appellant Khamiso for commission of offence and exonerated the rest of the accused facing trial namely Dadlo and lnayat. This self contradictory statement of complainant further creates doubts about the prosecution story.
14.
 In the light of above discussion it appears that prosecution has failed to discharge its burden satisfactorily and there appear major lacunas and contradictions in the evidence brought on record. It is settled law by this time that for giving benefit of doubt to an accused it is not necessary that there should be many circumstances creating doubts. If a simple circumstance creates reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the guilt of accused, then he will be entitled to such benefit not as a matter of grace and concession but as a matter of right. Reliance in this regard is placed on the case of Tariq Pervez v. State (1995 SCMR 1345)
14(sic). The upshot of the above discussion is that there being no satisfactory basis for upholding the conviction and sentence of the appellant, therefore, the impugned judgment was set aside and criminal appeal was allowed by short order.

 ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J.---
Kaleemullah, the petitioner has invoked the revisional jurisdiction of this Court, being dissatisfied from order dated 22.04.2017 of learned Additional Sessions Judge-I, Lakki Marwat, with the following prayer:
""By accepting this revision petition, the impugned orders of the learned trial court dated 22.04.2017 may kindly be set aside. It is further prayed that the learned trial Court may be directed to allow the defence counsel for further cross-examination related to the questions which could not be asked due to impugned orders of the learned trial Court.""
2.
 Short and relevant facts of the case are that petitioner is an under trial prisoner in sessions case No.45 of 2017, vide FIR No.64 dated 24.02.2015 under sections 302/324, P.P.C, Police Station Tajori.
3.
 Challan was submitted on 29.10.2015, thereafter petitioner was formally indicted on 20.11.2015. The prosecution produced and examined eleven (11) PWs. The controversy which is the subject matter of the present revision petition ensued during the cross-examination of PW-12, Mutabar Khan, Investigating Officer of case, when the following questions were asked from the said PW, which were objected by counsel for the complainant and the objections were sustained by the learned Trial Court, the above referred questions are reproduced below.
""Question
. Can you tell that you have mentioned the fact of receiving a reference chit from the constable on first day of investigation in case diary No.1.
Objection by counsel for the complainant:
 The question with regard to contents of Zimnies cannot be put by defence unless and until the same is referred by the witness himself.
 
Order of the Court:
 Objection sustained.
Again another question of defence also met the same fate, which is given below:
 
Question;
 Did you write all the case diaries on the spot or in P.S?
Objection by counsel for the complainant
: The question with regard to preparation of Zimnies cannot be put by defense unless and until the same is referred by the witnesses himself.
 Order of the Court
: Objection sustained.
4.
 Before responding the controversy involved in the revision, this would be appropriate to quote the relevant provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code and Articles of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order.
 
172 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
172. Diary of proceedings in investigation
. (1) Every police-officer making an investigation under this Chapter shall day by day enter his proceedings in the investigation in a diary, setting forth the time at which the information reached him, the time at which he began and closed his investigation, the place or places visited by him, and a statement of the circumstances ascertained through his investigation.
(2) Any Criminal Court, may send for the police-diaries of a case under inquiry or trial in such Court, and may use such diaries not as evidence in the case, but to aid it in such inquiry or trial. Neither the accused nor his agents shall be entitled to call for such diaries, nor shall he or they be entitled to see them merely because they are referred to by the Court; but if they are used by the police-officer who made them, to refresh his memory, if the Court uses them for the purpose of contradicting such police-officer the provisions of the Evidence Act, 1872 section 161 section 145 as the case may be, shall apply.
 
155, 157 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order.
155. Refreshing memory:
 (1) A witness may, while under examination, fresh his memory by referring to any writing made by himself at the time of the transaction concerning which he is questioned, or so soon afterwards that the Court considers it likely that the transaction was at that time fresh in his memory.
(2) The witness may also refer to any such writing made by any other person, and read by the witness within the time aforesaid, if when he read if he knew it to be correct.
(3) Whenever a witness may refresh his memory by reference to any document, he may with the permission of the Court, refer to a copy of such document:
Provided the Court be satisfied that there is sufficient reason for the non-production of the original.
 (4) An expert may refresh his memory by reference to professional treaties.
157. Right of adverse party as to writing used to refresh memory:
 Any writing referred to under the provisions of the two last proceeding Articles must be produced and shown to the adverse party if he requires it, such party may, if he pleases, cross-examine the witness thereupon.
5.
 Investigation officer of the case is not a formal witness, he is person who has collected the evidence and has placed the same before the Court. He has got a pivotal role under the criminal Justice system. Reliance is placed on case titled ""Abdul Sattar v. The State through Advocate General NWFP"" (2008 SCMR 684), wherein it is held that:
""There is no cavil to the proposition that the Investigating Officer is not a formal witness and his evidence subject to the qualifying test to be believed is at par to that of any other prosecution witnesses""
6.
 More so, collection of evidence does not mean collection of prosecution evidence it includes defence evidence as well. Reliance is placed on case titled ""Shad Mohammad Khan v. The State and another"" (2013 YLR 71 Peshawar), wherein it is held that:
6. It is the duty of Investigating Officer to record the version of the accused party in every case if presented because the Investigating Officer is not only duty bound to collect evidence which favours the prosecution. Investigating Officer is obliged to conduct fair, impartial and honest investigation and to collect the evidence produced by the prosecution as well as on behalf of accused.
7.
 Under section 172(2), Cr.P.C. a Police officer, the investigation officer of the case can refreshes his memory before recording his statement and then under Article 140 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order (section 145 of the Evidence Act) it is the inalienable right of the accused to cross-examine the witness to contradict or corroborate him as the case may be.
8.
 In the instant case, Motabar Khan, Investigation officer, was under examination as PW-12 before the Court and there is nothing on record to show that he was examined without consultation of police file, once he consulted police file then he is amenable to cross-examination. The two questions which were disallowed by the Court, the former was specific to Zmini (daily diary) which in view of this Court was rightly disallowed instead of referring to Zimni (daily diary) the accused or his agent should have referred to the investigation of case, while in latter one the witness should have been allowed to answer the query of defence.
9.
 Be that as it may, once a witness refreshes his memory defence is entitled to see the particular portion of case diaries, at the same time cross-examiner is at liberty to ask questions with regard to the investigation of case because the ultimate is to arrive at a just and proper decision of the case otherwise the Court can look into the diaries and the deposition of witness recorded at the trial and shall form its own opinion without referring the daily diary in its order or judgment as the case may be .
10.
 In view of above observations, this revision petition is disposed of in the following terms that PW-12 Mutabar Khan be re-summoned as witness and defence be allowed to cross-examine him with regard to the investigation of case as provided by section 172(2), Cr.P.C. and 157 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, order accordingly.
JK/253/P
 Order accordingly."

 SALAHUDDIN PANHWAR, J.---
Through instant bail application, applicant is seeking post arrest bail in Crime No.97 of 2015 registered at Police Station Shahdadpur under sections 302, 34, P.P.C.
2.
 Precisely, the relevant facts of the case are that due to land dispute applicant along with co-accused persons attacked upon the complainant party; accused Dildar caused fire shot injury to the deceased Abdul Jabbar who received on his chest and subsequently succumbed to the injuries.
3.
 At the outset learned counsel for the applicant contends that specific role is not assigned to the applicant with regard to causing any injury; deceased received one injury which is specifically alleged against accused Dildar; applicant's role is shown that he was accompanying with the other accused persons hence the question of common intention requires further probe. In support of his contentions, learned counsel has placed reliance on the cases reported as 2014 SCMR 1347, 2012 SCMR 1137 and 2016 MLD 886.
4.
 Learned A.P.G. is not disputing the facts as narrated by the counsel for the applicant, however counsel for the complainant contends that applicability of Section 34, P.P.C. is very much available in this case; applicant joined the other accused persons and by their act one young person lost his life. He placed reliance on the case reported as 2014 PCr.LJ 1415.
5.
 There can be no denial that mere appearance of one's name in FIR is never sufficient to snatch his otherwise guaranteed but the law always requires prima facie existence of reasonable grounds so as to make the Court believe that accused is guilty of an offence falling within prohibitory clause. To curtail the liberty of a person is a serious step in law therefore even while making tentative assessment the judicial scale must be allowed to tilt wherever available material takes it. Referernce may be made to the case of Zaigham Ashraf v. State and others 2016 SCMR 18 wherein it is held as:--
""9. To curtail the liberty of a person is a serious step in law, therefore, the Judges shall apply judicial mind with deep thought for reaching at a fair and proper conclusion albeit tentatively however, this exercise shall not be carried out in a vacuum or in a flimsy and casual manner as that will defeat the ends of justice because if the accused charged, is ultimately acquitted at the trial then no reparation or compensation can be awarded to him for the long incarceration, as the provisions of Criminal Procedure Code and the scheme of law on the subject do not provide for such arrangements to repair the loss, caused to an accused person, detaining him in jail without just cause and reasonable grounds. Therefore, extraordinary care and caution shall be exercised by the Judges in the course of granting or refusing to grant bail to an accused person, charged for offence (s), punishable with capital punishment. The Courts are equally required to make tentative assessment with pure judicial approach of all the materials available on record, whether it goes in favour of the Prosecution or in favour of the defence before making a decision.
This has been basic objective because of which it is by now a well settled principle of law that where an accused of capital punishment even, if succeeds showing absence of reasonable grounds towards his being guilty, the accused is entitled for bail not as a matter of grace but as of right.
 It is settled principle of law that the normally question of vicarious liability is one of further inquiry unless other compelling reasons exist to reach a different conclusion (2010 SCMR 1178). This being so, such question is normally left open for the trial Court to decide. Admittedly, there is no active role assigned to the applicant/accused except that of his alleged presence which in absence of any active role would make the case open for further probe particularly when two other accused persons, similarly charged, were placed in column-II by the investigating agency while submitting the charge sheet. It is also a matter of record that deceased received one injury which has categorically been assigned to the accused Dildar. All these circumstances prima facie show that there are no other exceptional circumstances which could make an exception to principle of law that question of common intention is one of further probe. These facts show that this is the case of further inquiry. Accordingly, the applicant is admitted to post arrest bail subject to his furnishing solvent surety in the sum of Rs.200,000/- (Rupees two lac) and P.R. Bond in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court.

 MUHAMMAD QASIM KHAN, J.---
Briefly the facts of the case are that while serving as Member Technical PTCL, proceedings under National Accountability Ordinance, 1999 (hereinafter to be called as ""NAB, Ordinance"") were initiated against him, which culminated into filing of a Reference before the Judge, Accountability Court No.II Rawalpindi/Islamabad (to be referred as ""NAB Court"") and as shall be seen from the order dated 17.03.2003 the petitioner opted for plea bargain under section 25(b) of NAB Ordinance, which was allowed by the NAB Court and consequently, per force of Section 25(b) read with Section 15 of the Ordinance, ibid, the petitioner was disqualified from holding the public office w.e.f. 17.03.2003 by an order dated 24.03.2005. By avoiding unnecessary details of litigation, it is to be mentioned here that lastly the petitioner filed Writ Petition No.27001/2011 which was allowed by this Court vide judgment dated 18.12.2012 in the terms that the appellate authority/The President of Pakistan was directed to decide the petitioner's representation and the President of Pakistan vide order dated 31.12.2014 dismissed petitioner's representation, hence, this writ petition.
2.
 It is argued by learned counsel for the petitioner that from the record it is visible that vide order dated 24.03.2015 the petitioner was dismissed from back date i.e. 17.03.2013, whereas, no adverse order could be passed with retrospective effect. Further argued that the petitioner has also been treated discriminately as compared to other two employees namely Khalid Mehmood and Bashir Hussain. The learned counsel while touching the maintainability of this writ petition contended that although subsequently the PTCL was made a company but as earlier the petitioner had served under statutory rules, therefore, in the light of case ""Masood Ahmad Bhatti and others v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, M/O Information Technology and Telecommunication and others"" (2012 SCMR 152), the writ petition is competent against the impugned orders. Lastly prayed that while setting-aside the orders dated 24.03.2005 and 31.12.2014, the order of dismissal from service be converted into an order for compulsory retirement from service.
3.
 On the other hand, the learned law officer assisted by learned counsel for the respondent department argued that as earlier the petitioner was employed in Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation which was converted into Company having the control over its affairs and also with respect to service of its employees, hence, no writ petition against a company is competent. Further argued that under section 25 read with section 15 of NAB Ordinance, after entering into plea bargain the petitioner earned the status of a convict employee, and at the moment plea bargain was accepted, forthwith he ceased to hold public office, as such, no illegality has been committed in the order dated 24.03.2005 whereby the petitioner was dismissed from service w.e.f. 17.03.2003, date of acceptance of his plea bargain. While touching the ground of discrimination it was argued that two wrongs cannot make a right. Lastly, argued although the order passed by the President of Pakistan is not binding on the company but even then in the impugned order each and every aspect has been discussed and the instant writ petition is liable to be dismissed.
4.
 I have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the parties at considerable length and perused the entire relevant record.
5.
 So far as the question of maintainability of instant writ petition is concerned, while deducing analogy from the case ""Masood Ahmad Bhatti and others v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, M/O Information Technology and Telecommunication and others"" (2012 SCMR 152) it becomes clear that earlier the petitioner was employee of Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation having statutory rules, later-on converted into Company but service of the petitioner still will be governed under the statutory rules, therefore, as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the cited case, the instant writ petition is held to be fully competent and maintainable before this court.
6.
 It is admitted position between the parties that proceedings under NAB, Ordinance were initiated against the petitioner a Reference before the NAB Court was submitted and on 17.03.2003 the petitioner opted for plea bargain under section 25(b) read with section 15(a) of NAB Ordinance, which was allowed. For ready reference sections 15(a) and 25(b) of the NAB Ordinance, are reproduced hereunder:--
15. (a) Where an accused person is convicted of [an offence under section 9 of this Ordinance] he shall forthwith cease to hold public office, if any, held by him and further he shall stand disqualified for a period of ten years, to be reckoned from the date he is released after serving the sentence, for seeking or from being elected, chosen, appointed or nominated as a member or representative of any public body or any statutory or local authority or in service of Pakistan or of any Province;
Provided that any accused person who has availed the benefit of [subsection (b) of section] 25 shall also be deemed to have been convicted for an offence under this Ordinance, and shall forthwith cease to hold public office, if any, held by him and further he shall stand disqualified for a period of ten years, to be reckoned from the date he has discharged his liabilities relating to the matter or transaction in issue, for seeking or from being elected, chosen, appointed or nominated as a member or representative of any public body or any statutory or local authority or in service of Pakistan or of any Province,
(b) Any person convicted of an offence [under section 9 of this Ordinance] shall not be allowed to apply for or be granted or allowed any financial facilities in the form of any loan or advances [or other financial accommodation by] any bank or financial institution [owned or controlled by the Government] for a period of 10 years from the date of conviction.
 Section 25(b):-
""(b) Where at any time after the authorization of investigation, before or after the commencement of the trial or during the pendency of an appeal, the accused offers to return to the NAB the assets or gains acquired or made by him in the course, or as a consequence, of any offence under this Ordinance, the Chairman, NAB, may, in his discretion, after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case, accept the offer on such terms and conditions as he may consider necessary, and if the accused agrees to return to the NAB the amount determined by the Chairman, NAB, the Chairman, NAB shall refer the case for the approval of the Court, or as the case may be, the Appellate Court and for the release of the accused.""
This court is aware of the fact that provincial and federal public servants when are proceeded under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 or Federal Investigation Agency Act, 1974 and convicted they are not automatically dismissed or removed from service by virtue of their conviction and the authority i.e. the departmental authority has to proceed separately under the relevant laws and pass an independent order but the special enactment i.e. NAB Ordinance which provides for effective measures and speedy disposal of cases involving corruption, corrupt practices, misuse or abuse of power or authority and misappropriation of property, provides somewhat different mechanism i.e. when an accused enters into plea bargain during investigation or the trial, by bare reading of Section 25(b) read with Section 15 of the NAB Ordinance, is clear that the legislators have taken note of such eventuality and perhaps considering the seriousness of the charge towards the society as a whole, they not only inserted section 15 in the NAB Ordinance but also used the word ""forthwith"" in the said provision, it means that sooner/at the moment when plea bargain is opted by an accused and approved by the court, he at once/ immediately/without any further delay ceases to hold the public office.
7.
 Here in this case, admittedly the plea bargain opted by the petitioner concluded on 17.03.2013, therefore, for all practical purposes the petitioner ceased to remain on job. However, every department is expected to maintain, manage and update the service records of its employees, for various internal purposes like audit, assessment of working strength, creation of new posts, etc. Therefore, despite the fact that petitioner ceased to hold the office on 17.03.2003, the respondent department in order to update its records for departmental intricacies, took up the matter of the petitioner and purely on the basis of his conviction by the NAB, vide Inter Office Memo dated 24.03.2005 the petitioner was dismissed from service w.e.f. 17.03.2003 (the date of conviction by the NAB). The order dated 24.03.2005 though for departmental purposes, yet the same in fact is implementation of specific provision (Section 15) of the NAB Ordinance. In this respect para-5 of the order passed by NAB court against the petitioner is relevant and the same is reproduced hereunder for ready reference:--
""Khalid Habib shall deemed to be convicted under section 9 of the NAB Ordinance and he shall forth with cease to hold public office, if any, held by him and further he shall stand disqualified for a period of ten years, to be reckoned from the date he has discharged his liabilities relating to the matter or transaction. In issue, for seeking form being elected, chose, appointed or nominated as a member or representative of any public body or any statutory or local authority in the service of Pakistan or any of the Province Reference to the extent of Khalid Habib accused be filed.""
In the light of above reproduced paragraph, the contention that the order dated 24.03.2005 amounts to passing of an order with retrospective effect, is not well founded. In this respect the case ""Muhammad Aslam, Ex-Deputy Director (Audit) District Govt. Lahore Region, Lahore v. Auditor-General of Pakistan, Islamabad"" (2013 SCMR 1904) is referred, wherein, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan held that:--
""The law has provided the penalty in the nature of disqualification on entering to plea bargain. It is not in dispute that the plea bargain as entered into and accepted by the Chairman. NAB and the NAB Court accorded approval in terms of section 26(b) of the Ordinance and ordered release of the appellant. As a consequence of the approval, it entails the penalty in terms of proviso to subsection (a) of section 15 of the Ordinance, by which the appellant stood disqualified.""
8.
 As regards the question of discrimination, although the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan jealously safeguards the citizens from any sort of discrimination but whether any illegal act or order by an authority could be made a ground for another legal act/order. I have given my anxious consideration to this aspect, but feel that as the order/act of any subordinate authority is not precedent and has not binding effect on the courts to be, followed and for considering any case whether discrimination has been meted out or not, the courts have to see:--
i)
 if the order has been passed by the Supreme Court or the High Court on a principle of law, that must be followed and no other person should be discriminated;
ii)
 However, when an order is passed by an executive authority then the court while issuing a writ on the ground of discrimination must consider whether such order has been passed fairly, impartially, in a transparent manner and strictly within the parameters of law. If the order does not stand to the above touchstone, then such order could not be weighed to issue writ on the ground of discrimination alone.
In this respect the case ""PRTC v. Mahmood Ahmad"" (2007 PLC 196) is referred, wherein, it has been held that two wrongs do not make a right. Furthermore; the Indian Supreme Court in the case ""Chandigarh Administration v. Jagit Singh and another"" (AIR 1995 Supreme Court 705) held that:--
""8. We are of the opinion that the basis or the principle, if it can be called one, on which the writ petition has been allowed by the High Court, is unsustainable in law and indefensible in principle. Since we have come across many such instances, we think it necessary to deal with such pleas at a little length. Generally speaking, the mere fact that the respondent-authority has passed a particular order in the case of another person similarly situated can never be the ground for issuing a writ in favour of the petitioner on the plea of discrimination. The order in favour of the other person might be legal and valid or it might not be. That has to be investigated first before it can be directed to be followed in the case of the petitioner. If the order in favour of the other person is found to be contrary to law or not warranted in the facts and circumstances of his case, it is obvious that such illegal or unwarranted order cannot be made the basis of issuing a writ compelling the respondent-authority to repeat the illegality or to pass another unwarranted order. The extra-ordinary and discretionary, power of the High Court cannot be exercised for such a purpose. Merely because the respondent-authority has passed one illegal/unwarranted order, it does not entitle the High Court to compel the authority to repeat that illegality over again and again. The illegal/unwarranted action must be corrected, if it can be done according to law-indeed, wherever it is possible, the court should direct the appropriate authority to correct such wrong orders in accordance with law, but even if it cannot be corrected, it is difficult to see how it can be made a basis for its repetition. By refusing to direct the respondent authority to repeat the illegality, the court is not condoning the earlier illegal act/order nor can such illegal order constitute the basis of a legitimate complaint of discrimination. Giving effect to such pleas would be prejudicial to the interest of law and will do incalculable mischief to public interest.""

 For what has been discussed above, I do not see any merit in this writ petition and the same is dismissed.

 KHADIM HUSSAIN TUNIO, J.---
Through this common order, I propose to dispose of captioned applications for grant of bail as same are outcome of same FIR hearing No.142 of 2014.
2.
 Succulently, the facts of the prosecution case are that on 30.12.2014, at about 01:50 p.m., at the Otaq of applicant Ihsan Ahmed situated in Deh Metahar, complainant Baia Muhammad along with his brother Noorullah, Muhammad Alim and Haji Thahrio were available for taking lea can the invitation of applicant Ihsan, where applicants namely Ihsan Ahmed, Sultan and Farooque with co-accused Abdul Jabbar. Imdad and one unidentified person were sitting in the Otaq. After taking tea. accused persons went home and brought guns and K.Ks, aiming their weapons upon the deceased Noorullah and declared him as Karo. Applicant Ihsan fired from his KK upon deceased Noorullah, in the meantime, applicant Sultan and Farooque with co-accused Abdul Jabbar also tired with K.Ks, directly upon the deceased Noorullah. with the intention to commit his Qatal, the bullets directly hit him, who after receiving tire arm injuries/fell down. 'Thereafter, all the applicants and co-accused fled away from the scene. Thereafter, on 31.12.2014, at around 01:50 p.m. the complainant recorded the FIR after the funeral of the deceased.
3.
 Learned Counsel for the applicants submits that the applicants are innocent and have been falsely involved in this case by the complainant party; that all the witnesses are close relatives and deeply interested in the prosecution case; that applicants namely Sultan and Farooque were found innocent by the Investigating Officer and their names were placed in Column No.2 of the challan, but learned Magistrate while taking cognizance issued NBWs against them; that there is delay of three days in lodging of the FIR, hence false implication of applications after due consultation cannot be ruled out at this stage; that applicant Ihsan was arrested by the police on 11.01.2015 and till this day is behind the bars; that soon after the incident, complainant obtained a letter (lash chakas form) for the post mortem and after postmortem and observing funeral ceremony of the dead body, went to police station where he reported. the matter though there was sufficient time with the complainant to register the FIR, but he failed to do so. After the arrest of applicant Ihsan, not a single incriminating article was recovered from his possessions which may connect him with this crime; that applicants Ihsan and Farooque and co-accused Abdul Jabbar all fired at the deceased, hence it would be determined at trial; that which shot was fatal and caused the death of the deceased; that majority of the co-accused persons have been let off during the course of investigation, which facts make the case of prosecution of two versions; that the applicants namely Sultan and Farooque after grant of interim relief were attending the learned trial Court regularly for a period of about 4/5 months and never misused the concession of bail; that the case has been challaned as such, the applicants are not required for investigation purpose; that it is the tendency of area to involve as many as innocent persons along with actual culprits just to settle the account of their enmity; that when the NB Ws were already converted into B.Ws by this Court then there was no need to cancel the pre-arrest bail of applicants namely Sultan and Farooque; that the case of applicants requires further inquiry as contemplated under subsection (2) of section 497, Cr.P.C.; that co-accused Imdad has already been granted post-arrest bail by this Court; that police after registration of FIR thoroughly investigated the case, recorded 161, Cr.P.C. statements of independent witnesses and came to conclusion that applicants are innocent, hence case of prosecution has become of two versions, which one is correct, it is yet to be determined at trial, that there is inordinate delay in conclusion of trial and such delay is attributed on the part of complainant party; that expeditious trial is right of every accused which cannot be denied to the present applicants. He has cited case-law reported as 1998 SCMR 01, 2004 PCr.LJ 1843, 2005 MLD 1267, 2016 YLR 2671, PLJ 2013 73, 2010 SCMR 966, 1995 SCMR 1765, 2016 PCr.LJ Note 73 and unreported authority Cr.B.A.No.S-552 of 2015, Re: Abdul Wahid v. The State, Cr.Misc.A.No.S-105 of 2010, Re: Loung Khan and others v. The State, Cr.Misc.A.No.S-111 of 2015, Re: Muhammad Afzal and others v. The State and Criminal Petition No.105-K of 2002.
4.
 As against this, Learned APG opposed the bail application of applicants. While Messrs Shafi Muhammad Mahar and Gul Muhammad Mahar argued that names of applicants are disclosed in the FIR with specific role; that the bail of applicant Sajjad Ahmed was dismissed as withdrawn on 24.08.2015; that the bail application filed on behalf of applicant Sajjad Ahmed is not maintainable at law; that police opinion regarding innocence of applicants Sultan and Farooq is not binding upon the court; that the delay in conclusion of trial is attributed to the applicants as in this case charge against the accused persons was framed on 01.03.2016 and the matter adjourned to 16.012016 for evidence. on 16.03.2016. 14.04.2016. 25.08.2016 and 01.09.2016 the complainant \\vas in attendance but the learned counsel for applicants was called absent, as such, matter was adjourned; that the delay if any is not attributed on the part of complainant party, hence he prayed for rejection of bail application.
5.
 Having heard and perused the relevant record carefully with their assistance.
6.
 On perusal of case papers, it appears that applicants are nominated in the FIR with specific allegations; that the applicants along with co-accused had allegedly committed murder of deceased Noorullah. This fact finds support from the statements of prosecution witnesses recorded under section 161, Cr.P.C. Nothing has been brought on record that prosecution witnesses have any ill will or grudge against the applicants, which prima-facie shows involvement of the applicants in this case of serious and heinous in nature and the punishment for offence with which present applicants are booked falls under the o prohibitory clause of section 497, Cr.P.C.
7.
 Applicants also seek bail on the ground of statutory delay in conclusion of trial, therefore, I have gone through the newly amended provision in section 497, Cr.P.C., which o contemplates that where court is of the opinion that delay in trial of the accused has not been occasioned by an act or omission of the accused or any person acting on his behalf, direct that such accused persons be released on bail, who is accused of an offence punishable with death, has been detained for such offence for continuous period exceeding two years and trial has not been concluded provided that the above benefit will not be available to a previously convicted offender for an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life. As far as the delay for non conclusion of trial within a period of two years is concerned, it is to be noted that on 16.03.2016, 14.04.2016, 25.08.2016 and 01.09.2016 although prosecution witnesses were present in court for recording of evidence but case could not be proceeded on account of non-availability of defence counsel or adjourned at the request of defence counsel. As per case diaries of trial court available on record, which shows that defence was responsible for causing delay in finalization of trial within the period of two years. The intention of law is to see that whether finalization of the trial has taken place on account of the delay caused by the defence. In the case of Akhtar Abbas v. The State reported in PLD 1982 SC 424, adjournments were sought on eight occasions and it was observed that all that is necessary to be seen whether the delay in finalization of the trial has, in any manner, been delayed by an act or omission on the part of the prosecution or defence. In the case in hand, delay was partly attributed to the applicants, which was clear Vifrom the diary sheet of the trial Court. Again in another case of Muhammad Younis v. The State reported in 1995 SCMR 1087, it was held that the defence on four occasions had requested for adjournment and the accused, therefore, was not entitled to concession of bail. Also in the case of Javid-ur-Rehman another v. The State reported in 2010 SCMR 1744 although on one date, prosecution witnesses were present in Court but counsel for accused did not appear for recording of evidence, bail was refused by 1-Ion'ble Supreme Court.
8.
 It is settled proposition of law that in criminal administration of justice, each case has to be decided on its own facts and circumstances and Courts are required to exercise jurisdiction independently. Reliance in this respect is placed on a case of The State v. Haji Kabeer Khan reported in PLD 2005 Supreme Court 364 and in case of Muhammad Faiz alias Bhoora v. The State and another reported in 2015 SCMR 655, it has been held as under:--
""S. 497(2)---Bail---Case-law cited by counsel for accused in support of bail--Relevance---Precedents in bail matters were of no help to a party, as it varied from case to case depending upon the facts of each case---Court had to examine as to whether accused had made out a case of further inquiry or not.""
9.
 In another case of Farrukh Qadri v. State (2006 PCr.LJ 1256), it has been held by this Court as fallows:
""The narration of the facts, depicting the picture of attendance of witnesses in the year 2005 shows that they were present on 10 dates and it is not difficult to visualize that these were not the only dales when they appeared and case did not proceed and, therefore, they lost patience and discontinued to appear before the Court. The prosecution and defence are not supposed to test patience of the witnesses and when they lose it then start claiming concession. The benefit can be sought only if the witnesses fail to appear in order to cause the delay and extend the incarceration of the accused person in jail.""
""When the 3rd and 4th proviso to section 497, Cr.P.C. were on the Statute Book, this point was considered by several superior Courts. Pre-dominant view was that if the witnesses appeared on several dates and were not examined, their subsequent absence, shall not justify the release of accused on bail as a matter of right and same principle is still applicable when the bail is not be granted as a matter of right but can be considered on the ground of inordinate delay in disposal of the case.
""I would also like to observe that generally the trial Courts appear to be totally oblivious of the provisions contained in section 540-A, Cr.P.C. and, therefore, are not resorting to this provision, in any case, which was inserted to meet the eventualities as in this case. It appears that the learned Advocate for the complainant and prosecutor, as well as the learned defence counsel .failed to assist the Court and never made a request that if one or two accused were not produced on any particular date, while other accused persons were present before the Court and the witnesses were in attendance, and the accused who were not produced before the Court were represented through the Advocate the case could be proceeded with. I am of the opinion that the trial Court, prosecutor, Advocate for the complainant and the defence Advocates have equally contributed in causing delay in disposal of the case and perpetrating the agony on the accused as well as prosecution witnesses. This state of affairs cannot he termed as satisfactory by any stretch of imagination. The system of law can work properly if all the stake-holders perform their duty properly and with due diligence. Be that as it may, the entire responsibility for delay cannot he saddled on the shoulder of prosecution witnesses, therefore, I am of the opinion that the applicant is not entitled to he released on bail. The bail application stands dismissed accordingly.""
10.
 For the above stated reasons, criminal bail applications are dismissed. However, trial Court is directed to decide the case within a period of three months time its compliance report be submitted to this Court through learned Additional Registrar for perusal.
11.
 As far as case law referred by learned counsel for applicants at Bar are; riled, the same have been perused and considered but the same are distinguishable the facts of the case in hand.
12.
 Needless to mention here that the observations made hereinabove are tentative in nature and would not influence trial Court while deciding the case of applicants/accused on merits.

 MUHAMMAD AYUB KHAN, J.---
Having failed to get the concession of bail from the Courts of learned Judicial Magistrate-II, D.I.Khan and learned Additional Sessions Judge-I, D.I.Khan vide orders dated 12.4.2017 and 19.4.2017 respectively, accused/ petitioner Faheem Ullah has filed the instant petition for the same relief in case FIR No.308 dated 05.4.2017 registered under Section 489-F, P.P.C. at Police Station Cantt, D.I.Khan.
2.
 As per contents of FIR, complainant Muhammad Noor submitted an application dated 29.3.2017, to the District Police Officer, D.I.Khan to the effect that the accused/petitioner obtained Rs.2,18,00,000/- from him for the purpose of business of medicine and in this regard on 26.7.2016, he issued two cheques i.e. one cheque bearing No.34414728 amounting to Rs.1,18,00,000/- and other cheque bearing No.34414729 amounting to Rs.10000000/- of Habib Bank Ltd. Circular Road Branch, D.I.Khan for encashment on 25.3.2017 and also scribed an Iqrar Nama dated 26.7.2016 in favour of complainant in presence of witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan and Din Muhammad. On 28.3.2017, the complainant submitted cheque No.34414729 worth Rs.100,00,000/- in his account at United Bank Ltd. Circular Road Branch, D.I.Khan for transfer of amount from the account of accused/petitioner but it was dishonoured due to insufficient funds. On the application of complainant/ respondent No.2 above referred FIR was registered against the accused/ petitioner.
3.
 Arguments heard and record perused.
4.
 Admittedly, the accused/petitioner issued the cheque in question to the complainant which was dishonoured vide cheque return memo dated 28.3.2017 for reason of insufficient funds, which prima facie establish that the petitioner was having no intention to pay the outstanding amount to the complainant. The act of the petitioner amounts to financial murder of the complainant. 
5.
 It is also on the record that the accused/petitioner issued cheque of Rs.2,75,00,000/- in favour of one Zawail which was dishonoured and in this respect a case vide FIR No.245 dated 21.3.2017 was registered under section 489, P.P.C. at Police Station Cantt, D.I.Khan against the accused/petitioner which prima facie suggest that he is habitual offender of issuance of cheques and defrauding the people.
6.
 No doubt the case in hand is not covered by the prohibitory clause of section 497, Cr.P.C., but that alone cannot hold the petitioner entitled to the concession of bail. In such like cases, grant of bail is not a rule of universal application and each case is to be decided on the basis of its own merits keeping in view its own set of facts and circumstances. Reliance may safely be placed on Muhammad Siddique v. Imtiaz Begum and 2 others (2002 SCMR 442), Shameel Ahmad v. The State (2009 SCMR 174) and Muhammad Imran v. The State and another (2012 YLR 2748).
7.
 The tentative assessment of the available record prima facie connects the accused/petitioner with the commission of the offence and he is not entitled to the concession of bail. Consequently, his instant petition for release on bail is dismissed.

 WAQAR AHMAD SETH, J.---
Accused-petitioner, Mosam Khan son of Rasheed Khan, seeks bail in case FIR No. 06 dated 8.1.2006 under sections 302/364/34, P.P.C. registered at Police Station Mattani, Peshawar. He has been refused bail by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-XIV, Peshawar vide order dated 12.4.2017; hence, the instant petition for the same purpose.
2.
 Brief facts of the case are that father of the complainant, namely, Muslim Khan was abducted on 6.11.2005 at 0900 a.m. by the petitioner along with his co-accused, namely, Hassan Khan son of Rasheed Khan, Yaqoob Khan, Saeed Khan sons of Abdul Hameed, Abdul Hameed son of Gul Mir from the vicinity of Government High School Sherkera in the presence of Shah Zaman son of Abdul Hanan and Zahid Hussain son of Abdul Ghani and shifted him to tribal territory. However, on the same day, the abductee was killed. Motive is stated to be blood feud enmity. According to the complainant, the dead body was discovered by the political authorities and was brought to the village whereafter it was taken to the police station for registration of FIR but the local police refused the same; hence, he filed an application under section 22-A, Cr.P.C. before competent court of law, which was allowed on 2.1.2006 and on basis of which, the instant FIR was registered.
3.
 At the very outset, learned counsel for the complainant raised objection that this Court has got no jurisdiction to entertain the present bail petition because the deceased was done to death in the tribal territory and the accused-petitioner is required to approach the appropriate forum for such a relief. To meet the objection, first, I would like to reproduce section 403, Cr.P.C., which reads as under:
""403. Persons once convicted or acquitted not to be tried for the same offence. (1) A person who has once been tried by a Court of competent jurisdiction for an offence and convicted or acquitted of such offence shall, while such conviction or acquittal remains in force, not to be liable to be tried again for the same offence "".
 Similarly, this Court in the case of Munawar Khan v. Political Agent Khyber Agency Station and 4 others (2012 MLD 503), has held that:
""Ss. 365/400/401/411---Frontier Crimes Regulation, 1901, Ss. 11 & 48---Criminal Procedure Code (V of 1898), Ss. 180 & 403---Constitution of Pakistan, Arts. 199 & 13---Constitutional petition---Abducting, belonging to gang of dacoits and dishonestly receiving stolen property---Jurisdiction of court---Double jeopardy---Counsel for petitioner/accused had contended that as the case was registered at Police Station at Peshawar, and according to the FIR alleged abductee was abducted from settled area, Assistant Political Agent had no jurisdiction to try and convict accused; that no person would be prosecuted or punished for the same offence more than once and that all judgments under Frontier Crimes Regulation as well as by Judicial Magistrate Peshawar, be set aside and accused acquitted of the charge---Validity---Alleged abductee was abducted from the jurisdiction of Police Station at Peshawar; and was recovered from a place situated in Tribal Areas falling within the jurisdiction of Assistant Political Agent---Both Assistant Political Agency and Judicial Magistrate Police Station Peshawar had the jurisdiction to try accused as provided under S. 180, Cr.P.C.---Article 13 of the Constitution provided that no person would be prosecuted or punished for the same offence more than once which had also been provided under S. 403, Cr.P.C.---Subsequent trial of accused person by Judicial Magistrate Peshawar and his judgment, were violative of Art. 13 of the Constitution and S. 403, Cr.P.C. and were of no legal consequence"".
 In the instant case, co-accused of the petitioner, namely, Saeed Khan and Abdul Hameed were tried by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-VII, Peshawar and they were acquitted vide judgment/order dated 26.2.2010, against which, the complainant filed Cr.A. No. 291/2010 before this Court but the same was also dismissed in limine vide order dated 3.2.2011. Moreover, another co-accused, namely, Muhammad Yaqoob was also allowed bail by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-III, Peshawar vide order dated 4.5.2012 and against the said order, the complainant filed cancellation petition before this Court, which too, was dismissed vide order dated 15.2.2013, so keeping in view the above facts and circumstances of the case and while taking guidance from the judgment reported in 2012 MLD 503 (referred above) along with section 403, Cr.P.C., this Court has the jurisdiction to entertain the present bail petition; hence, the objection so raised by the learned counsel for the complainant is overruled.
4.
 Arguments heard and record perused.
5.
 Without going into deep merits of the prosecution case, suffice it to say, that five (05) persons have been charged by the complainant for the murder of his father Muslim Khan with no specific role, out of them, two were acquitted and one was granted bail by the competent court of law, whose trial is still pending. The case of present accused-petitioner is at par with them and he deserves alike treatment. Besides, the accused-petitioner, after arrest, remained in police custody but no recovery or discovery has been made from him.
6.
 As far as the abscondance of accused-petitioner is concerned, it has been settled law that mere abscondence is no ground to decline the bail, if the case of an accused is otherwise found fit for bail on merits and the bail cannot be refused even if he had remained an absconder. Reliance can be placed on the cases of State v. Malik Mukhtiar Ahmed (1991 SCMR 322) and Mitho Pitafi v. The State (2009 SCMR 299). Accused-petitioner is behind the bars since 31.1.2017. Investigation in the case is complete and the accused-petitioner is no more required for further investigation and keeping him behind the bars would serve no useful purpose, therefore, this Court is inclined to extend the concession of bail to him.
7.
 In view of the above, this bail application is accepted and the accused-petitioner is admitted to bail provided he furnishes bail bond in the sum of Rs. 400,000/- (Rs. Four lacs) with two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate, who shall ensure that the sureties are local, reliable and men of means.
8.
 Above are the reasons of my short order of even date.

Through this common order, I intend to dispose off four (04) Appeals bearing Nos.K-1224, 1223/2016, K-1226 and 1225/2016 directed against Order-in-Original Nos. 664/2015-16 and 665/2015-2016 dated 20.04.2016 passed by Additional Collector of Customs, Adjudication-I, Customs House, Karachi.
2.
 Since, these 04 appeals are based on similar facts and questions of law, therefore, it is needless to reproduce facts of each case separately. Hence, being heard and dealt with and disposed off simultaneously though this common order in the light of the judgment of the Honorable High Court of Sindh in Customs Reference No. 157 of 2008, S.M. Naqi son of Syed Muhammad Hussain v. Collector of Customs (Adj-I) and others. For reference the facts of Appeal No.K-1224/2016 as reported by the Directorate General of Intelligence and Investigation-Customs, Enforcement, Karachi (here-in-after to be referred as respondent No. 2), M/s. Chief Auto Centre (Pvt.) Ltd., Lahore (here-in-after as Appellant No. 1) imported a consignment machinery/excavator parts stuffed in 1 x 40"" container. Upon receipt of import documents delivered those to his clearing agent M/s. Haris Enterprises, Karachi (here-in-after as Appellant No. 2) for transmitting Goods Declaration under the provision of section 79(1) of the Customs Act, 1969 and Rule 433 of Sub-Chapter III of Chapter XXI of Customs Rules, 2001 with the MCC of Appraisement-West, which he did and as per pre-requisite deposited upfront duty and taxes, consequent to which GD was numbered as KAPW-HC-62483 dated 08.10.2015. Upon appearance of Goods Declaration, the nominated Appraiser instead of completing the assessment on the basis of the declaration and scanned documents, opted to get the goods examined under Section 198 of the Act and Rule 435 of the Rules. He while adducing his opinion transmitted the GD to the Deputy Collector of the Group, who gave his assent and transmitted the GD to the Deputy Collector KICT, who marked that to the examiner for conduction of physical examination of the imported goods for determination of actual description, quantity and quality. The examiner concerned carried out the examination and found the goods in accordance with the declaration and report so prepared was posted by him in the reservoir of the Goods Declaration. The nominated Appraiser upon appearance of report on his desktop, completed the assessment and passed assessment order under Section 80 of the Act and Rule 438 of the Rules and transmitted view message for payment of additional amount of duty and taxes, which was deposited by the appellant No. 2 after obtaining pay order from appellant No. 1, consequent to which the inbuilt authority of the WeBOC passed Clearance Order in terms of Section 83 of the Act and Rule 442 of the Rules. Immediately, after passing of Clearance Order, the officials of respondent No. 2 blocked the delivery and thereafter detained the goods on the plea that the assessment order so passed is erroneous being passed on the basis of declaration and examination report, scanned documents/catalogues upon receipt of view message under Rule 437 of the Rules, which is contrary to the actual description and classification of the goods. The official of respondent No. 2 subsequently examined the goods, which transpired that the appellant No. 1 in active connivance of appellant No. 2 has obtained clearance of auto parts of trucks in the garb of machinery and excavator parts, which are poles apart from each other auto parts falls under PCT 8409.9910 as against declared and assessed 8409.9999 and 8483.6099, this resulted in loss of Rs. 2,444,889.00 and the act of the appellant's falls within the ambit of section 32(1) and (2) sections 3, 4, 6, 33 and 34 of the Sales Tax , 1990 and section 148 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, punishable under clause (14) of section 156(1) and aforesaid Sections of the Sales Tax and Income Tax. As a result of the said finding, the official of respondent No. 2 seized the goods under section 168(1) of the Act and a notice under section 171 was also served upon the appellants. The appellant No. 1 sensing the gravity of the issue filed a Constitution Petition in the High Court of Sindh, which ordered release of the goods after depositing pay order of the amount of revenue loss and post dated cheques against the anticipated imposed fine and penalty. In compliance of the order of the Hon'ble High Court of Sindh after securing the pay order and post dated cheques, the respondent No. 2 ordered MCC of Appraisement-West to release the consignment. Which in the presence of passed assessment order under section 80 of the Customs Act, 1969 piled upon it yet another order passed under section 81 of the Act and the goods were delivered to the appellant No. 1. Thereafter, the officials of respondent No. 2 prepared contravention report and forwarded that to Collector of Customs, Adjudication-I, who referred to the competent authority defined in section 179 of the Act. In consideration of the contravention report, the Additional Collector of Customs, Adjudication-I, issued show-cause notice dated 23.11.2015 containing the facts and the contravening provision of the Act/Ordinance as were reported in the contravention report. The appellant No. 1 replied the show-cause notice, which failed to impress the subordinate of respondent No. 1 and he passed order dated 20.04.2016, through which he held the charges against the appellants as established and ordered confiscation of the goods subject to redemption of those upon payment of 35% of the value of the goods in terms of SRO 499(I)/2009 dated 13.06.2009, imposed penalty of Rs. 200,000.00 on the appellant No. 1 and Rs. 100,000.00 on appellant No. 2, in addition to in addition to the worked out evaded amount of duty and taxes of Rs.2,444,889.00/.
3.
 Being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the order-in-original, the appellant filed the instant appeal before this Tribunal on the grounds incorporated in the memo of appeal. The appellant's counsel further argued that on the basis of grounds of appeal and facts, the instant appeal may kindly be accepted and the Order passed by the adjudicating authority may kindly be set aside in the interest of justice.
4.
 The respondent department has submitted Para-wise comments in reply to the memo of appeal, which are placed on record. The departmental representative further submitted that the Order passed by authority below is correct in facts and law, which is required to be upheld.
5.
 Heard the arguments, and perused the record and the relied upon documents/judgments by the appellant's. It is felt appropriate for me to first settle the objection of the respondent No. 1 that the instant appeals could not be heard for decision unless the imposed fine and penalty is not paid by the appellant as expressed in section 195-B of the Act and for that an appropriate order may be passed, while dismissing the appeals of the appellants as non maintainable. In this context, it is clarified that Section 195-B of the Act, is directory and permissive in nature, therefore the appeal cannot be dismissed on the basis of non deposit of imposed fine/penalty. The said provision is imperative and obligatory as it uses the word ""shall"", this word or must are generally considered as mandatory but it is equally well settled that the word ""shall"" and ""may"" depending upon the context in which they have been said or often interchangeable as held by Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in reported judgment PLD 1972 SC 326 that ""it is now well settled that the words ""may"" and ""shall"" in legal phraseology are interchangeable depending on the context in which they are used or not to be interpreted with the rigidity, which is attributed to them in ordinary parlance."" Although section 195-B of the Customs Act, 1969 while directing the deposit of amount of duty in respect of goods which are not under the control of customs authority or any penalty levied under this Act uses expression ""shall"" no consequences are flowing in the expression for non compliance. Another well settled principle of interpretation of statutes became applicable that as the language of section 195-B of the Customs Act, 1969 is in affirmative and not negative, it is deemed to be directory not mandatory as held in reported judgment PLD 1974 Supreme Court 134 Niaz Muhammad Khan v. Mian Fazal Rakib that ""as a general rule a statute is understood to be directory when it contains matter merely of direction, but not when those direction are followed up by an expressed provision that, in default of following them the fact shall be null and void. To put it differently if the act is directory its disobedience does not entail any invalidity; if the Act is mandatory disobedience entail serious legal consequences amounting to the invalidity of the act, done in disobedience to the provision. The respondent No. 2 failed to appreciate that the provision of section 195-B has to be read in harmony and in the benefit of the appellant because non payment of imposed penalty least snatch his right of appeal guaranteed under section 194-A of the Customs Act, 1969. Hence, it is appropriate to dispense with the condition of payment of penalty as i.e. proper and just course of action and decide the appeal on merit as right of appeal is an inalienable guaranteed under section 194-A and Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan and injunction of Islam beside the said act would had been an act of allowing the appellant a fair trial in terms of Article 10-A of the Constitution of Pakistan 1973 (18 Amendment). My findings have the validation of reported judgment 1993 MLD 1645, 1993 CLC 1405 and 2005 PTD (Trib.) 731.
6.
 Prior to dealing with the merits of the case, it is noted with concern that the Adjudicating Authority, for the purposes of imposition of Redemption Fine, has resorted to application of SRO 499(I)/2009 (which has been issued under the Provisos to section 181 of the Customs Act, 1969) despite there being no allegation as to the subject import being violative of section 15 or a notification issued under section 16 of the Customs Act, 1969 or any other law for the time being in force, which requirements clearly have the mandate of law under the referred Provisos to section 181 of the Customs Act, 1969. Such recourse has been had by the Adjudicating Authority without there being any allegation in such regards either narrated in the Show-Cause Notice or, for that purpose, in the Order-in-Original, impugned in the present appeal. In mounting one illegality upon the other, the Adjudicating Authority has also unlawfully fixed the amount of the Redemption Fine to the extent of 35% of the value of the offending goods in spite of the fact that the honourable Sindh High Court in the case of Weave & Knit (Pvt.) Limited (reported at 2004 PTD 2981) and a Division Bench of the Customs Appellate Tribunal in the case of Novo Nordisk Pharma (reported at 2013 PTD (Trib.) 2186) have held that ""Customs Value"" is to be worked out with reference to the amount of duty/taxes attempted to be evaded and not the value of the ""offending goods"". In accordance with the word of the law as well as the principle laid down by the honourable High Court of Sindh, as followed by a Division Bench of this Customs Appellate Tribunal, I do not have any difficulty in holding that the manner in which the Redemption Fine has been imposed simply militates against the settled principle, of law and is neither warranted nor sustainable under the law.
7.
 Reverting to the factual aspects and merits of the case, the appellant's counsel argued that the engine parts for diesel engines, as imported, were for use in the engines of the earth moving machinery and that there was no strength in the departmental allegation that these had been imported for use in the heavy duty vehicle. To such an end, Goods Declarations were produced on the importer's behalf to substantiate that as a matter of long standing practice like and identical goods had been cleared on the basis that these were to be used in the engines of earth moving machinery. In rebuttal, the DR contended that the subject engine parts were for use in the heavy duty vehicles as was established during the adjudication proceedings on the strength of documents furnished by them. Upon being asked as to whether there was any difference between the engines of the earth moving high-powered machinery and those of the heavy-duty automotive vehicles, satisfactory response was not advanced on the respondents' behalf. It was, nevertheless, contended that the appellant importer commercially imported and dealt in engine parts for heavy duty vehicles which fact gave credence to the fact that the subject imported engine parts were to be used in the heavy duty automotive vehicles and not the earth moving machinery.
8.
 Upon perusal of the operating part of the subject Order-in-Original, it is seen that the documents produced by the appellant, in defending the case made out against them by the officers of the DG I&I-FBR, were not relied upon by the Adjudicating Authority on the basis that these were "" .... Photocopies of the leaflets retrieved by the respondents from different websites . "" and also as ""computer printouts of websites other than the manufacturer and various instructions manuals in Japanese language .."". It is further stated that it was confirmed by the respondent/Detecting Agency that the appellant was the ""importer/ trader"" of automotive engine replacement parts ""for vehicles, including earth moving and other machinery"". The Adjudicating Authority did not take into consideration the Purchase/Supply Order as had been issued to the appellant importer for supply of spare parts of construction machinery on the basis that the appellant importer was not able to produce any evidence by way of Sales Tax Invoice duly supported with Sales Tax Return that they ever supplied an identical part(s) to any construction company/contractor for use in machinery in the past. In the same manner the so-called printouts and leaflets from websites were also purportedly not taken into consideration by the Adjudicating Authority on the pretext that the appellants could not put forth any plausible reason and/or arguments to rebut the charges against them when purportedly and allegedly confronted with the original catalogue of the manufacturer.
9.
 Upon minute examination of what has been stated by the Adjudicating Authority in the impugned Order-in-Original, it is rendered obvious that the appellant importer's two contentions have been given two different and separate treatments. Firstly, the appellant importer's contention that it was an importer of engine replacement parts for vehicles, including earth moving and other machinery was deemed by the Adjudicating Authority to confirm (on account of the use of the word vehicle) that the appellant was the commercial importer of automotive engine replacement parts completely ignoring the fact that the appellant importer had contended that such vehicles also included earth moving and other machinery. Notwithstanding the fact that a quasi-judicial form is not vested with the authority to pick and choose from a party's contention or to interpret it in such manner as is beneficial to the prosecution's case and to discard what is detrimental to it, I also find no justification in the Adjudicating Authority not accepting the Purchase/Supply Order produced by the appellant importer on the pretext that it was not supported by the evidence such as Sales Tax Invoices and Returns as to the past transactions. Once a party, during the adjudication proceedings, has produced documentary evidence as to the legality of its imports then the burden of proof in terms of Sections 156(2) and 187 of the Customs Act, 1969, stands discharged and it is then for the department to prove the party's contentions to be as incorrect, which, in my opinion, was not done in the present case and while the mere use of the word ""vehicles"" in the appellant importer's pleadings was used against him to treat him as a commercial importer of replacement engine parts of vehicles only but simultaneously the other documents that he produced in aid of his contentions that the subject goods were for use in the construction and other machinery was not even considered on the basis of lack of further documentary evidence in such regards as to the ""past transactions"". Accordingly, I find no merit and substance in the Adjudicating Authority's finding as to the subject goods being engine replacement parts to be used in vehicles other than the construction and other machinery.
10.
 In relation to the NPR catalogue, of which there is no mention in the Show-Cause Notice and, therefore, the appellant importer cannot be deemed to be confronted with the same during the adjudication proceedings, the learned DR was specifically asked the question whether the engines used in the construction machinery (excavators, bulldozers, fork-lifters etc.) were any different from those used in the heavy vehicles, trucks and buses, he replied in the negative but asserted that on account of the fact that the appellant importer also dealt in replacement engine part of vehicles, therefore, it cannot be said with certainty that these would indeed be used in the construction machinery. I am not inclined to accept such contention insofar as the classification of any goods is not dependent upon the manner in which these are to be used in the post importation scenario and even otherwise the appellant importer has successfully established the existence of past practice in relation to the subject goods to be cleared under the HS Codes 8409.9999 and 8483.6099. The honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Radaka Corporation reported at 1989 SCMR 353 has held that a departure from departmental practice following a particular course in the implementation of a rule will be extremely unfair.
11.
 Besides the above discussed points of utmost importance. It is further matter of facts that the goods were examined under section 198 of the Act and Rule 435 and thereafter the authorities defined in sections 80 and 83 of the Act in exercise of the powers vested upon them through Notification No.371(I)/2002 dated 15.06.2002 passed valid assessment/ clearance orders, meaning thereby the goods were out of charge of Customs. Those could not be detained or seized by either respondent No.2 or his subordinates for the purpose of examination and assessment or even classification, nothing this sort is permissible as it is settled principle of law that after the goods are out of charge the Customs Officials became functus officio. Even otherwise, powers of valuation, classification and assessment are not available to the official of respondent No.2 under SRO. 486(I)/2007 dated 09.06.2007. In case of apprehension of evasion of duty and taxes, the appropriate course available with the respondent No. 2 was to file an appeal under the provision of Section 193 of the Customs Act, 1969 against the assessment orders passed under Section 80 of the Act and Rule 438 of the Rules, incorporating the apprehension and fact of the case and the contravening provision of the Act/Rules. Upon receipt of appeal, the Collector Appeal if observed that the contention of the officials of respondent No. 2 is correct is empowered to issue show-cause notice under the provision of section 32 to the importer/appellant and upon receipt of the reply to the show-cause notice have to pass an order, after perusal of the grounds of appeal and the reply to the show-cause notice. Instead of adopting the correct course of law, the respondents reopened the assessment order under the provision of Section 195 of the Act, under which only Board or Collector is empowered. The respondents reopened the assessment orders by assuming the powers of Collector, which is tantamount to usurpation and renders the detention/seizure/ show-cause notice and Order-in-Original without power, hence, void and ab-initio and of no legal effect. Similarly, neither respondent No. 2 nor respondent No. 1 is empowered to frame contravention report or issue show-cause notice and pass order-in-original under any provision of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 and Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, by virtue of the fact that none of them are appointed as officer of Inland Revenue under the provision of sections 30-A and 30 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 and sections 228 and 207 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001. Resultant insertion of the provision of Sales Tax and Income Tax in contravention report and invoking of those in the show-cause notice is without lawful authority and as such of no legal effect. This lapse is fatal and renders the action right from detention till order-in-original, ab-initio, null and void.
12.
 It is noted with concern that despite framing of contravention report and issuance of show-cause notice to the appellants under the provision of Section 32(2) of the Act, which speaks about ""deliberate act and collusion"" none of the Customs Officials of MCC of Appraisement-West, who examined the goods and passed assessment/ clearance orders under the provision of sections 198, 80 and 83 of the Act and Rules 435, 437, 438 and 442 of the Rules, have been charged under the provision of Section 32 despite apparent ""deliberate act and collusion"" if analyzed with the contravention report, show-cause notice and order-in-original. If the respondents are of the view that none of the officials of MCC of Appraisement-West are involved, it is hard to digest because none of the appellant are allowed to arrange the examination, instead i.e. arranged by the Terminal Operator on the order of Deputy Collector of Customs KICT or his subordinate. Similarly, the assessment order is passed by the appropriate authority independently without any influence either of the appellants. If it is assumed for the sake of arguments that none of the customs officials were involved, in that case Section 32(2) is not applicable and case in question falls within the ambit of ""error, omission or misconstruction"" attracting the provision of Section 32(3) of the Act, the authority to issue show-cause notice under the said section is Principal Appraiser as enunciated in SRO 371(I)/2002 dated 15.06.2002. To the contrary, in the instant case the show-cause notice and order-in-original have been issued/passed by the Additional Collector. No authority is empowered to assume the powers of his subordinate prescribed for the purpose of adjudication because while performing their duties as quasi judicial authorities they cannot be termed as subordinate to the higher officer and they are quite independent in performing their officials duties as adjudicating officers. This lapse render the show-cause notice and order-in-original without lawful authority and jurisdiction. Hence, ab-initio, null and void.
13.
 I am also flabbergasted to observe that respondents have charged the appellants for mis-declaration under the provision of section 32(2) of the Act, in the absence of availability of collusion, although this is without any basis, if it is presumed that their exist any collusion, that it could not be with the active connivance collusion of the Officials of MCC of Appraisement-West. Ironically, no charges have been levelled under Section 32(2) against them. I have also noticed that in similar case of M/s. Trading House, Karachi, relating to GD No. KEPW-HC-184947-23052015, contravention report was prepared, which was rejected upon conduction of 2nd examination report, on the basis of which assessment order was passed to the contrary, in the case of appellant contravention was framed for adjudication proceeding despite standing on the same pedestal as of appellant. This act of the respondents proves that the appellant has been met out with partial and different treatment in negation of Articles 4 and 25 of Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The High Court of Sindh in its reported judgment 2002 PTD 976 held that ""vacating the show-cause notice in one case and taking action against another person in similar situation, is amount to discrimination which is hit by Article 25"". In reported judgment 2002 SCMR 312 and 2009 PTD 1507 the Hon'ble Superior Courts ""there exist no power to target incidence of tax in such a way that similarly placed person be dealt not only this similarly, but discriminatingly"". Whereas, in reported judgment 2005 SCMR 492 the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that ""A facility allowed to some one and denied to other is discrimination"". The Apex Court further held in reported judgment 2010 SCMR 431 that:
""doctrine of equality, as contained in Art. 25 of the constitution, enshrine golden rules of Islam and states that every citizen, no matter how high so ever, must be accorded equal treatment with similarly situated persons--- State may classify persons and objects for the purpose of legislation and make laws applicable only to persons or objects within a class--- In fact all legislations involve some kind of classification whereby some people acquire rights or suffer disabilities whereas others do not--- What however, is prohibited under principle of reasonable classification, is legislation favouring some within a class and unduly burdening others-- Basic rule for exercise of such discretion and reasonable classification is that all persons laced in similar circumstances must be treated alike and reasonable classification must be based on reasonable grounds in given set of circumstances but the same in any case must not offend spirit of Art. 25 of the Constitution.""
14.
 For the foregoing reasons and in the light of prescribed law and evidences, the instant appeal is allowed and I, hold that the subject goods, in terms of description and HS Codes, are to be assessed as per the appellant importer's declaration and consequently the Order-in-Original, impugned by the appellants, and the Show-Cause Notice providing the basis thereof are hereby set-aside with no order as to costs.
15. 
 Order passed and announced accordingly.

40,"MUHAMMAD IQBAL Versus GOVERNMENT OF KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA through Secretary to Government, Finance Department, Peshawar","June 8, 2017","PESHAWAR HIGH COURT"," Honorable Justice Muhammad Younis Thaheem ","2018 PLC(CS)N 174","JUDGMENT
 MUHAMMAD YOUNIS THAHEEM, J.---
Through this single judgment we propose to decide the instant writ petition along with connected W.P. No.1418-P/2014 titled 
Molvi Muhammad and 4 others v. Government of KPK through Secretary Education (E&S), Peshawar and others
 and W.P. No.2053-P/2014 titled 
Saeed Ullah and 32 others v. Government of KPK through Secretary S&GAD and others
, as in all above petitions common question of law and facts regarding non-granting of two advance increments on attaining higher educational qualifications, granted under Notification No. FD(PRC)1-1/89 dated 11.08.1991 Paragraph 5 are involved. Brief facts of the instant writ petition and connected petitions are separately given below:
i)
 
W.P. No.913-P/2014:
 The petitioners served in police department and retired as Inspectors, claimed above said relief after attaining higher educational qualifications by acquiring LL.B Degrees, they filed W.P. No.3600/2010 which was allowed by this Court vide judgment dated 28.10.2010 and were declare entitled for the benefit of two advance increments already given to other civil servants but inspite of favourable judgment of this Court in their favour, the petitioners were refused relief, therefore, they filed contempt of Court petition bearing C.O.C. No.201-P/2013, wherein this Court after hearing the parties passed an order for the implementation of judgment instead Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Cessation of Payment of Arrears on Advance Increments on Higher Educational Qualification Act IX, 2012 was promulgated, which has been challenged on the ground that it is to nullify the effects of judgment dated 28.10.2010 in W.P. No.3600/2010 titled as 
Muhammad Iqbal and others v. Provincial Police Officers, K.P.K Police and others
 by giving it retrospective effect from 01.12.2001 so to the extent of retrospectivity given in Section 2 of the ibid impugned Act is liable to be truck down.
ii)
 
W.P. No.1418-P/2014:
The petitioners are employees of Education Department working on the posts of AT and TT who attained Master Degrees during service, so claimed same relief as were deprived, so filed W.P. No.1791/2009 which was decided by this Court vide order dated 08.09.2009 with the direction to decide the matter of advance increments within 03 months, but respondents gave deaf ear to the grievance of the petitioners rather to make the aforesaid judgment as effectless, promulgated enactment known as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Cessation of Payment of Arrears on Advance Increments on Higher Educational Qualification Act-IX of 2012 which is ineffective upon the rights of petitioners, so be declared as null and void and its retrospectivity given in section 2 be expunged.
iii)
 
W.P. No.2053-P/2014:
 The petitioners in the above referred petition are provincial government civil servants in different capacity from BPS-1 to BPS-15 in the education department who also during service attained higher qualifications, so sought relief provided vide notification dated 11.08.1991. The petitioners approached respondent No.4 by filing representation/departmental appeal for the grant of two advance increments but their said representation has not been considered but took shelter in the notification dated 03.01.2009 which contemplates as following: 
 ""Now it has been decided that those who are although entitled but have not availed the same facilities so far will not be given advance increments in future""
but said notification dated 03.01.2009 has been declared discriminatory and violative of law by Honourable Supreme Court in judgments passed in C.P.L.A. No.525 of 2007 titled as 
Rashid Iqbal Khan v. District Coodination Officer, Abbottabad and others
 and C.P.L.A. No.526 of 2007 titled as 
Muhammad Haroon Qureshi v. District Coodination Officer, Abbottabad and others
 decided on 19.07.2007. Moreover, the petitioners have also challenged the vires of ibid KPK Act IX of 2012.
2.
 The petitioners in all the above said petitions have invoked the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court for the relief regarding grant of two advance increments on attaining higher educational qualifications and in this regard the notification dated 03.01.2009 has been set aside in W.P. No.368/2009. Petitioners have also challenged the vires of K.P.K Cessation of Arrears on Advance Increments on Higher Educational Qualification (hereinafter called impugned Act IX of 2012) to the extent of giving it retrospective effect before 01.12.2001 as against law with prayer to declare it null and void and it be expunged to the extent of retrospectivity.
3.
 Comments from respondents were called who submitted the same wherein they took stance that the petitioners have no any vested rights in view of notification dated 03.01.2009 and new enactment said K.P.K. Cessation of Arrears Act IX of 2012 and notification dated 03.01.2009. Respondents contended that the existing scheme of advance increments has been discontinued w.e.f. 03.01.2009 and vide section 2 of ibid impugned Act before 01.12.2001 and have given it retrospective effect which is within legislative powers of Pakhtunkhwa Assembly.
4.
 The learned counsel for the petitioners argued that issuance of notification dated 03.01.2009 and giving retrospective effect to the impugned enactment K.P.K. Cessation Act, 2012 is only aimed to nullify the beneficial effects of judgment of this Court in W.P. No.3600/2010 vide which notification dated 03.01.2009 has been set aside by this Court and by Honourable Supreme Court in above mentioned CPLAs decided on 19.07.2007, so this Court can examine the constitutionality of the piece of legislation by ibid impugned section 2 of K.P.K. Cessation Act IX of 2012 to the extent of giving it retrospective effect. He added that so many civil servants of provincial government had been benefited earlier from the notification dated 11.08.1991 but petitioners have been deprived, so the impugned enactment is mala fide to nullify the judgment of this Court and prayed for striking it down to the extent of section 2 of impugned ibid Act by giving it retrospective effect before 01.12.2001.
5.
 On the other hand learned counsel for the respondents supported the impugned notification dated 03.01.2009, relied on their comments and impugned Act. He further argued that this enactment is neither aimed at to nullify the judgment of this Court nor that of Honourable Supreme Court. He lastly argued that petitioners are not entitled for the advance increments due to aforesaid notification dated 03.01.2009 and ibid impugned Act IX of 2012.
6.
 Arguments heard and record perused.
7.
 From the perusal of record it is admitted position that vide paragraph 5 of the notification dated 11.08.1991 issued by Finance Department, it was provided that any civil servant of Provincial Government Department who attained higher qualifications during service, would be entitled for two advance increments and due to said notification admittedly so many civil servants had already been benefited. However, above said relief has not been extended to petitioners despite of representations to their higher competent authorities and judgment passed by this Court as well as by Honourable Supreme Court particularly in W.P. No.1791/2009 decided on 08.09.2009 vide which direction was given to the respondents to decide the representation of the petitioners within 03 months but neither the respondents have decided the matter nor given said advance increments, on this inaction, petitioner filed COC Petition No.133/2010 which was disposed of vide order dated 11.10.2012 as abated in the light of impugned Act, IX of 2012 known as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Cessation of Payment of Arrears on Advance Increments on Higher Educational Qualification Act, 2012 in the light of provision by giving it retrospective effect before 01.12.2001, so the petitioners feeling aggrieved have challenged the vires of above said notification and impugned enactment to the extent of giving it retrospective effect.
8.
 In brief the reliefs sought by the petitioners in all petitions is, one for the grant of two advance increments in purview of notification dated 11.08.1991, second for the implementation of beneficial judgments in W.P. No.368/2009 dated 24.03.2009 and W.P. No.3600/2010 dated 28.10.2010 and in third to declare the retrospective effect of impugned ibid Act, IX of 2012 as null and void and for expunction.
9.
 The question for determination before this Court is as to whether impugned enactment passed by the Pakhtunkhwa Assembly with legislative nomenclature as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Cessation of Payment of Arrears on Advance Increments on Higher Educational Qualification Act, IX of 2012 is to nullify the effects of aforesaid judgments passed by this Court and to annul the beneficial effects of notification dated 11.08.1991 from which earlier so many civil servants of different departments of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have been benefited.
10.
 We examined the impugned notification dated 03.01.2009 and whole of impugned ibid Act IX of 2012 by giving it retrospective effect before 01.12.2001. A query was put to the learned counsel for respondents as to whether before promulgation of impugned Act, its cause was removed and as whether that same provision in the impugned legislation would not amount to nullify the effects of judgment passed by this Court in the light of judgment of Honourable Apex Court cited as 2013 SCMR 1752, on this learned counsel for the respondents failed to provide some reasonable and rational explanation for giving the impugned Act as retrospective effect before 01.12.2001. The Honourable Supreme Court while taking cognizance about the anomaly and miscarriage of justice caused to other civil servants in the Sindh Province for giving out of turn promotions by way of deputation and absorption of different officers in the province of Sindh through legislation by way of amending Sindh Civil Servants (Amendment) Act, 2013 and Sindh Civil Servants (Second Amendment) Act, 2013 but said piece of enactment in aforesaid enactment through amendment was struck down in the referred judgment i.e. 2013 SCMR 1752 (Contempt Proceedings case).
11.
 In the above cited judgment the Honourable Supreme Court held that Supreme Court either on its own or on petition by party is vested with the judicial power to examine, review and expunge the vires of such piece of legislation/amendment relating to the rights of civil servants and having public importance.
12.
 The Honourable Supreme Court vide above said judgment set aside the piece of legislation promulgated by the Sindh Assembly with regard to out of turn promotions of some officers by way of deputation /absorption. In the said judgment certain principles have been enunciated regarding instruments/piece of legislation which had nullified the effects of the judgments passed by Honourable Apex Court as well as of Honourable Sindh High Court. In this respect paragraphs Nos.165, 166 and 167 of said cited judgment are reproduced below:
 165. The leading judgment on the subject issue, which our Courts have approvingly referred to the case of 
Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narain
 (AIR 1975 SC 2299) which relates to amendment in the Election Laws of India. In the said judgment Paras 190 and 191 are importance and reproduced hereunder:-
 ""190. A declaration that an order made by a Court of law is void is normally part of the judicial function and is not a legislative function 
 191. The position as it prevails in the United States, where guarantee of due process of law is in operation, is given on pages 318-19 of Vol. 46 of the American jurisprudence 2d as under:
 ""The general rule is that the legislature may not destroy, annul set aside, vacate, reverse, modify, or impair the final judgment of a Court of competent jurisdiction, so as to take away private rights which have become vested by the judgment. A statute attempting to do so has been held unconstitutional as an attempt on the part of the legislature to exercise judicial power, and as to violation of the constitutional guarantee of due process of law. The legislature is not only prohibited from reopening cases previously decided by the Courts, but is also forbidden to affect the inherent attributes of a judgment. That the statute is under the guise of an act affecting remedies does not alter the rule. It is worthy of notice, however, that there are cases in which judgments requiring acts to be done in the future may validly be affected by subsequent legislation making illegal that which the judgment found to be illegal, or making legal that which the judgment found to be illegal.""
13.
 Similarly Paragraphs Nos.166 and 167 of the cited judgment (2013 SCMR 1749) are reproduced as under:
 ""166. This Court in the case of 
Fecto Belarus Tractor Ltd. v. Government of Pakistan through Finance Economic Affairs and others
 (PLD 2005 SC 605) has held that when a legislature intends to validate the tax declared by a Court to be illegally collected under an individual law, the cause for ineffectiveness or invalidity must be removed before the validation can be said to have taken place effectively .
 167. In order to nullify the judgment of the Court, 
unless basis for judgment in favour of a party is not removed, it could not affect the rights of a party in whose favour the same was passed.
 The issue of effect of nullification of judgment has already been discussed in the case of Mobashir Hassan reported in (PLD 2010 SC 265), Para-76 discusses the effect of nullification of a judgment by means of a legislation. In the said case, the view formed is identical to the one in the case of 
Indira Nehro Gandhi v. Raj Narain
 (AIR 1975 SC 2299) and 
Fecto Belarus Tractor Ltd. v. Government of Pakistan through Finance Economic Affairs and others
 (PLD 2005 SC 605) and it was observed that the legislature cannot nullify the effect of the judgment and there are certain limitations placed on its powers including the one i.e. by amending the law 
with retrospective effect on the basis of which the order or judgment has been passed thereby removing basis of the decision.
""
 (Underlining are ours for emphasis)
14.
 In the petitions in hand the Government of Pakhtunkhwa by means of issuing notification dated 03.01.2009 had nullified the effect of notification dated 11.08.1991 and same notification dated 03.01.2009 had been declared null and void by this Court in judgment passed in W.P. No.3600/2010 dated 28.10.2010 and Honourable of Supreme Court in above referred C.P.L.As. No.525 and 526 of 2007. So the petitioners were and are entitled for the benefits arising out of notification dated 11.08.1991 and the judgments passed by this Court, therefore, respondents were not legally authorized to deprive the petitioners from the beneficial effects of the aforesaid notification dated 11.08.1991 and aforesaid judgments through impugned ibid Act, IX of 2012 before first removing the cause that is entitlement and the aforesaid beneficial effects of judgments in the impugned notification dated 03.01.2009 and through the impugned ibid Cessation of Advance Increments Act IX of 2012.
15.
 Thus in view of above discussion, we are of the firm view that by promulgating impugned piece of legislation and giving it retrospective effect is nothing but to destroy, annul and make the judgments of this Court as well as of Honourable Supreme Court as effectless, therefore, to the extent of section 2 by giving it retrospective effect before 1.12.2001 is declared null and void so is hereby expunged and struck down from the aforesaid impugned Act IX of 2012. Hence, these petitions are allowed and the respondents are directed to provide them the benefits of two advance increments according to notification dated 11.08.1991 on attaining higher qualifications during service within the period of two months from the receipt of this judgment according to prescribed manner under the law then in field.

 RAJA SAEED AKRAM KHAN, J.---
The titled appeal by leave of the Court has been directed against the judgment passed by the High1Court on 26.5.2016, whereby, the writ petition filed by the appellant, herein, has been dismissed.
2.
 The facts in brief as stated are that the appellant, herein, filed a writ petition in the High Court, alleging therein, that he is Ex-Secretary General, Bar Association, Muzaffarabad and believe in the supremacy of law, protection of the fundamental rights of State-Subjects, especially, the Health, Education, Environmental protection and liberty of speech. It has been alleged that he filed the writ petition to realize the State functionaries with regard to their obligations and duties. The Chancellor of Azad Jammu and Kashmir University advertised the post of Vice Chancellor in daily newspaper 'Daily Jang' on 29.3.2016 through the President Secretariat. It is averred that the presidential Secretariat under the AJ&K Rules of Business, 1985 has no jurisdiction, to issue such like advertisement. He prayed for setting aside the advertisement dated 29.3.2016 and letter dated 22.3 2016 and the order dated 8.7.2015 through which a Search Committee has been constituted. After necessary proceedings, the learned High Court dismissed the writ petition vide impugned judgment dated 26.5.2016, which is the subject-matter of this appeal.
3.
 Sardar Karam Dad Khan, Advocate, the learned counsel for the appellant, submitted that the learned High Court while holding that the appellant is not an aggrieved person failed to resolve the factual as well as the legal proposition involved in the matter. He further submitted that the act of the respondents will cause the effects upon the whole society, therefore, he challenged the same being citizen of the State. He contended that the statutory provisions of section 10 of the AJ&K University Act, 1985 are ambiguous and arbitrary, therefore the same cannot be given preference over the Constitutional provisions which are the supreme law of the land. He further contended that under the provision of section 7 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act, 1974, the Presidential Secretariat has got no authority to issue the advertisement or to process the case for appointment of Vice Chancellor without any advice of the Prime Minister. He added that the learned High Court has travelled beyond its jurisdiction while issuing the recommendation to the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Bar Council for amendment of the rules. The learned counsel submitted that the learned High Court while delivering the impugned judgment has passed the unnecessary remarks regarding the conduct of the appellant, therefore, the learned High Court has travelled beyond the pleadings of the parties. He argued that the education is one of the fundamental rights of the state-subjects coupled with other constitutionally guaranteed fundamental rights. The University of Azad Jammu and Kashmir is a public institute, therefore, the appointment of the Vice chancellor without lawful authority can infringe the interest of the state-subjects and their future generations. He contended that under law it is the sole discretion of the Chancellor to appoint or remove the Vice Chancellor and determine his terms and conditions, whereas, such unguided powers are not recognised in any civilized society. He submitted that such arbitrary powers of Chancellor exercised by him without advice of the Prime Minister is departure from the Constitutional provisions. The Chancellor being the President has to act on the advice of the Prime Minister who is responsible and answerable before the public through elected representatives at the forum of the Assembly. The learned counsel has relied upon the cases reported as Rana Aamer Raza Ashfaq and another v. Dr. Minhaj Ahmad Khan and another [2012 SCMR 61], and Begum Nusrat Ali Gonda v. Federation of Pakistan and others [PLD 2013 SC 829].
4.
 On the other hand, Mr. Farooq Hussain Kashmiri, Advocate, the learned counsel for respondents Nos. 1 and 3, argued that the judgment passed by the learned High Court is perfect and legal, therefore, no interference is called for by this Court. He further argued that the appellant does not fall within the definition of aggrieved person and he has no locus standi to file the writ petition before the learned High Court, therefore, the appeal is liable to be dismissed on this sole ground. He argued that none of the rights of the appellant have been infringed whereas, only aggrieved person can file the writ petition for the protection of basic fundamental Constitutional rights. He contended that the advertisement dated 20.3.20116 and the appointment notification of the Vice Chancellor dated 28.7.2015 have been issued under section 10 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir University Act, 1985, therefore, no illegality, has been committed by the learned High Court while passing the impugned judgment.
5.
 Mr. Muhammad Zubair Raja, Additional Advocate-General, while appearing on behalf of respondent No. 2, supported the arguments of the learned counsel for respondents Nos.1 and 3. He submitted that the powers to appoint the Vice Chancellor are based on the relevant rules and the vires of the same cannot be challenged until and unless the same are inconsistent with the Constitution, whereas, no eventuality is available in this case. He has relied upon the cases reported as Raja Iqbal Rashid Minhas v. AJ&K Council and 3 others [PLD 2002 SC (AJ&K) 1], Raja Tahir Majeed Khan and others v. Azad Government and 6 others [2014 SCR 272].
6.
 We have heard the arguments of the learned counsel for the parties and the learned Additional Advocate-General at some length and gone through the impugned judgment along with the record made available. The controversy involved in the matter is that the appellant, herein, challenged the letter dated 22.3 2016 issued by the Presidential Secretariat, advertisement dated 29.3.2016 and the order dated 8.7.2015 through which a Search Committee has been constituted for the appointment of Vice Chancellor of the University of Azad Jammu and Kashmir. The claim of the appellant was that section 10 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir University Act, 1985 is ambiguous which confers the arbitrary powers to the President/Chancellor to make the appointment of the Vice Chancellor.
7.
 The learned High Court has given the main thrust on the question of maintainability of the writ petition and held that the same has been filed incompetently by a person who does not come within the definition of an aggrieved person. Thus, we also intend to attend this aspect of the case at first. During the course of argument, the learned counsel for the appellant was confronted that how he is an aggrieved person within the ambit of section 44 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act, 1974, he submitted that the appellant being an advocate believes in the supremacy of law and Constitution. The act of the Presidential Secretariat while issuing letter dated 22.3.2016 and advertisement dated 29.3.2016 and the order dated 8.7.2015, through which a Search Committee for appointment of Vice Chancellor of the University of Azad Jammu and Kashmir has been made, is in violation of the relevant law and rules. He submitted that the appellant agitated his grievance as pro bono publico before the learned High Court by challenging the vires of law.
8.
 To appreciate the argument addressed by the learned counsel for the appellant, we have given our serious thought to the relevant provisions of section 44 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act, 1974, which postulates that one can move the Court pro bono publico to challenge the vires of law on the ground that the same offends the provisions of the Constitution. The person who seeks a command from the High Court for enforcement of fundamental right must first show as to how he is an aggrieved person. A Writ can be issued only on the petition of an aggrieved person and not by a pro bono publico litigant. In other words a person whose interests have been adversely affected by the impugned legislation or order under challenge, he can competently file a writ petition and then file an appeal before the Supreme Court against the judgment of the High Court as required by law.
9.
 In the case in hand, we have failed to gather anything to ascertain that how the appellant is aggrieved by the act of respondent No. 2, herein. Neither the appellant is a candidate for the post of Vice Chancellor nor he is student of the University, therefore, no legal right of the appellant appears to be infringed. The argument of the learned counsel for the appellant that as pro bono publico he challenged the vires of the law before the learned High Court by filing writ petition, it may be observed that every person by his own sweet will, cannot file the writ petition as pro bono publico until and unless he fulfils the conditions to invoke the Constitutional jurisdiction of the High Court. The appellant while invoking such jurisdiction, has to show that he was litigating firstly, in public interest and secondly, for public good or for welfare of general public. In the case in hand, the appellant failed to show any such interest, therefore, he is not an aggrieved person. Thus, he could not invoke the Constitutional jurisdiction of the High Court as pro bono publico as laid down in a case reported as Javed Ibrahim Paracha v. Federation of Pakistan and others [PLD 2004 SC 482], wherein it has been held as under:--
""10. No doubt with the development of new concept of public interest litigation in the recent years, a person can invoke the Constitutional jurisdiction of the Superior Courts as pro bono publico but while exercising this jurisdiction, he has to show that he is litigating, firstly in the public interest and, secondly, for the public good or for the welfare of the general public.
 In a case reported as Col. (Retd.) Muhammad Akram v Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Defence, and others 1998 SCMR 2073], it has been held as under:--
""3. We are unable to subscribe to the above contention of the petitioner as the convict or his close relation could have filed the above writ petition but the petitioner has not been able to show any personal interest in the convict of the nature warranting filing of the same. The case in hand involves trial and conviction of an individual person and hence the principle of pro bono publico cannot be invoked in aid.""
 Similarly, in another case reported as Ghiasul Haq and others v. Azad Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir and others [PLD 1980 SC AJ&K 5], it has been held as under: -
""27. And if this is so the petition, as framed, was not maintainable under section 44(c) because the High Court cannot under the said constitutional provision grant a declaration simpliciter, nor anyone can move the Court pro bono publico to challenge the vires of a law on the ground that the same offends against any provision of the Constitution. The person who seeks a command from the High Court for enforcement of fundamental right must first show with reference to admitted or proved facts, as to how he is an aggrieved person; from what particular act or action he feels aggrieved, and to which authority he wishes the writ of the High Court to be directed ""
The case law referred to by the counsel for the appellant is not helpful to the case because it has distinguishable features and has nothing common with the case in hand.
10.
 In the light of what has been discussed above, we are of the unanimous view that the learned High Court has rightly held that the appellant does not fall within the definition of aggrieved person and has no locus standi to file the writ petition as pro bono publico. The findings recorded by the learned High Court are well reasoned, therefore, we are inclined to endorse the same. However, the remarks given by the learned High Court regarding the conduct of the appellant while deciding the writ petition appears to be unnecessary, therefore, the same are hereby quashed.
 This appeal stands disposed of in the terms indicated above.

 Order accordingly."

 MAQBOOL BAQAR, J.---
The present appeal was preferred against the judgment dated 6th December, 2014 rendered in Election Petition No. 10/2013, whereby the election of the appellant was declared void under section 68(d) of The Representation of the People Act, 1976 (""ROPA""), and the respondent No. 1, who being the runner-up had filed the above Election Petition, was declared elected under section 69 of ROPA.
2.
 The brief facts of the case are that the appellant and the respondents contested election for the National Assembly seat in constituency NA-215, Khairpur, held on 11.05.2013, and as per results announced by the Election Commission of Pakistan, the appellant secured 91809 valid votes, whereas respondent No. 1 obtained 66481 votes. The vote count of the appellant being the highest and that of the respondent No.1 being the second highest, the appellant was declared the returned candidate from the constituency, and the respondent No. 1 stood as the runner-up. Not being satisfied with the result, the respondent No.1 challenged the same through the above petition on the ground that the result was obtained by the appellant by indulging in corrupt practices and exercising undue influence as defined by sections 78(2) and 81(1)(a)(b) of the ROPA respectively.
3.
 The petition so filed contained various allegations and narrated several purported stances of alleged use of force, intimidation and undue influence, such as that a DSP, namely, Munir Ahmed Phulpoto who was posted at Karachi, harassed his voters and persuaded them to vote for the appellant, and though the Returning Officer conveyed such complaint to the Inspector General of Police, Sindh but to no avail. It was also alleged that the appellant along with a few others, in order to harass, intimidate and prevent the petitioner's voters from casting their votes, resorted to aerial firing across the constituency. It was further alleged that the appellant and his accomplices have attacked and fired at one Tahir Imtiaz and some other workers of the petitioner resulting in the death of one Abdul Wahab Narejo, and injuries to a few others of which incident an FIR was also recorded. It was claimed that on 12.05.2013 the respondent No.1 submitted a complaint before the Returning Officer regarding the conduct of the appellant. It was alleged that one Ghulam Abbas, filed an application under section 22(a)(b), Cr.P.C. for registration of an FIR along with an application for medical examination of some purported injured victims, whereupon learned IInd Additional Sessions Judge, Khairpur ordered investigation into the allegations. The respondent No.1 also mentioned names of three Presiding Officers and one Assistant Presiding Officer who allegedly complained of bogus voting at Polling Station, Malir Pato and that the ballot boxes which were snatched from them were filled with bogus votes, and further that the polling staff was confined and harassed by the appellant. The respondent No.1 further alleged that the appellant also removed ballot papers from the ballot boxes and further that the ballot boxes were already stuffed with bogus votes before they were sealed for voting. A further allegation was that the entire district administration was acting on the instructions of the appellant and his uncle Mr. Manzoor Hussain Wasan who had remained Provincial Home Minister during the previous regime. The respondent No. 1 claimed that at Polling Station (Ghulam Raza, UC Lyari, Tehsil Kotdiji, Mr. Manzoor Hussain Wasan threatened and compelled respondent No.1's election agents to leave the polling station. Another allegation was that the Presiding Officer was openly supporting the appellant and that his female agents were forced to leave the polling station Technical College, Tehsil Khairpur. The incidents were reported to the District Returning Officer and the Returning Officers and to the concerned SSP and also to the Army Headquarters, by Ghulam Shabbir Dayo, the General Secretary of respondent No. 1's political party through a written complaint. The respondent No. 1 also alleged that the polling staff who sympathized with the appellant's political party, prepared fictitious results in favour of the appellant and claimed that the Form No. XIV, in respect of polling station, Government Primary School, Kumb shows that at serial No. 7 the respondent No. 1 secured 444 votes, whereas as per the consolidated result he did not secure any vote at the said polling station. It was further submitted that at polling station Government Primary School, Nawab Wassan, the respondent No.1 has been shown not to have secured any vote, whereas the number of votes attributed to the appellant at the said polling station are 1051. Similarly only 8 votes have been shown in favour of the respondent No.1 at Government Primary School, Nawab Wasan, whereas the appellant is shown to have secured 1086 votes. Another allegation is that contrary to the relevant rules, and to favour the appellant, the election results were prepared on plain papers. Alleged incidents of preventing respondent No.l's voters were narrated in the petition, in respect of polling stations Raheem Bux Wasan, Government High School-II, Khairpur, Ghulam Raza Khokhar, UC Lyari, Kouro Ghoth, Taluka Khairpur, Talpur Wada, Hakeem Chakrani and Tando Nazar Ali.
4.
 In support of his case the respondent No. 1 filed his affidavit in evidence, wherein he reiterated the contents of his petition. He also filed affidavit in evidence of seven witnesses, namely, Muhammad Khan, Mrs. Nawab Khatoon, Muhammad Shareef, Safdar Ali Shah Jehania, Nawab Khan alias Raju, Ghulam Shabbir Dayo and Karim Bakhsh Kubar. The witness Muhammad Khan deposed that he resides near Kot Pull, Taluka Khairpur and that he went to cast vote in favour of respondent No. 1, but when he refused to oblige the appellant's agents by casting vote in favour of the appellant the Presiding Officer declined to issue ballot paper to him and that he was pushed out of the polling station. However during his cross-examination he stated that he is not conversant with the English language, wherein the affidavit was written, and that the contents of the affidavit were not read out to him in Sindhi, and upon being explained the contents of his affidavit to him in Sindhi he stated that the same were not correct. The witness was thus declared hostile and was cross-examined by the counsel for the respondent No. 1, but nothing could be extracted from the witness which could be helpful to the said respondent. The witness, Nawab Khatoon deposed that on the polling day she went to polling station Kot Pull but then some persons with muffled faces entered the polling station and resorted to aerial firing which caused terror, forcing her and the other lady voters of the respondent No. 1 to leave the polling station. However during her cross-examination she stated that since the faces of the culprits were muffled she could not see their faces. The third witness, namely, Muhammad Shareef deposed that he lives near Wada Machi and that he went to Polling Station Primary School, Kot Pull for casting his vote in favour of respondent No. 1 where the appellant and his accomplices resorted to aerial firing causing terror and harassment to the petitioner's voters and thus forcing them to leave the polling station without casting their votes. However during his cross-examination he admitted that there was a separate polling station for ""Wada Machi"" (the place where the witness lives) he also admitted not having produced his voters' certificate and that he has not complained about the incident to police or any other authority.
5.
 The 4th witness Safdar Ali Shah Jahania deposed that he went to cast his vote in favour of respondent No.1 to Polling Station Middle School, Mithri, however, Munawar Wassan along with some persons belonging to the appellant's party, duly armed, came to the polling station and caused harassment and commotion, and when the said witness along with one Ghulam Abbas resisted them, the witness and Ghulam Abbas were forcibly removed and were taken away in a vehicle and confined in a godown behind Munawar Wassan's bungalow in his village where they remained confined for three days and were severely beaten by Munawar Wassan and his accomplice, resulting in injuries on the back and head of the deponent, and facture in the arm, and head of Ghulam Abbas. Whereafter Munawar Wassan handed them over to Kotdiji police who booked them in a false criminal case, which case was subsequently disposed of under cancel clause. The witness further deposed that since FIR of the above incident was not being recorded, Ghulam Abbas filed an application under section 22-A, 22-B, Cr.P.C. which was allowed and an order was also passed for their medical examination.
6.
 Similar affidavit in evidence was filed by the 5th witness namely Nawab Khan alias Raju.
7.
 The sixth (6th) witness, namely Ghulam Shabbir Dayo, General Secretary Pakistan Muslim League (N), deposed that he was deputed at the complaint centre established by respondent No. 1, where he received complaints of aerial firing, injuries to voters, bogus voting and of malpractices by the appellant, his uncle Munawar Wassan and Syed Qaim Ali Shah, at various polling stations, which were noted down by him and were conveyed to the office of the District Returning Officer, Returning Officer, Army Headquarter and also to SSP Khairpur but to of no avail.
8.
 The seventh (7th) witness, namely Karim Bakhsh Kubar deposed that he was acting as Chief Election Agent for the respondent No.1, and was assigned to attend telephone complaints regarding ensuing election and that he received complaints of aerial firing at different polling stations. He referred to different polling stations in that regard and further deposed that the appellant in collusion with the election staff, police and some criminals succeeded in obtaining bogus votes, took away ballot boxes and also created terror and harassment in order to implead the election process.
9.
 From the above resume and the evidence recorded on behalf of the petitioner it can be seen that none of the witnesses even incidentally referred to any of the polling stations regarding which respondent No.1's petition contain any allegation. The only witnesses who, have deposed in consonance with certain allegations contained in the petition to some extent are Safdar Ali Shah Jahania and Nawab Khan also Raju, however, it has nowhere been disclosed by the said witnesses or any of the other witnesses, regarding the fate of the FIR allegedly sought to be registered by the said two witnesses. Furthermore and more importantly the incident of violence as alleged by the two witnesses pertain to Polling Station Middle School, Mithri, however, absolutely no reference to or allegation in relation to said polling station, has been made by respondent No.1 in his petition, or otherwise. Even the hand notes, of the complaints received by Ghulam Shabbir Dayo does not make any mention of the Polling Station Middle School, Mithri, from where the said witnesses were allegedly abducted. Moreover neither the doctor who purportedly issued the injury/medical certificate was produced nor was the photographer who took photographs of the injured produced. We may observe here that it is unsafe to accept oral evidence at its face value, unless the same is vouched and supported by unimpeachable documentary and/or circumstantial evidence. The evidence of the said two witnesses is thus wholly irrelevant and. inconsequential, and of no avail to respondent No.1. Whereas the evidence of Ghulam Shabbir Dayo is bereft of necessary details as required by law. Similarly the affidavit in evidence of Karim Bakhsh Kubar lacks in necessary details, contain vague allegations, and the only polling station mentioned therein, namely, Govt. Primary School Khanan Buriro, where according to the witness one police constable namely Ali Gohar Wassan was handed over to Rangers, does not find mention either in the petition or in the evidence of the petitioner, or in any of his other witnesses, whereas the appellant and the co-accused in the case of murder of Abdul Wahab Mourejo and of injuries to Tahir Imtiaz Phulpoto, as mentioned by the said witness, have been acquitted, as the complainant in that case who was allegedly injured in the incident, and the other witness namely Mushtaq Jagirani did not support to the allegations contained in the FIR.
10.
 It may be noted here that in order to successfully challenge an election on the ground that the same was induced through corrupt practices, the petitioner should be conscious of the fact that the charge of corrupt practices is in the nature of a criminal charge and has to be proved beyond any shadow of doubt. The standard of proof required for establishing such charge is the same as is applicable to a criminal charge. The evidence should be absolutely credible by the standards of the appreciation applicable to criminal cases and should be able to stand the test of strict and scrupulous scrutiny. It is also now well settled that the party seeking to challenge the validity of an election should essentially specify in the election petition the incident(s) of corrupt practice with as much precision as is possible and with all necessary details and particulars. The petitioner should keep in mind that no fresh charge or incident can be introduced during the trial. The other well pronounced principle is that the evidence in proof of the alleged corrupt practices is to be restricted to the instances as set out in the petition, and in order to succeed, the petitioner has to prove such ingredient of the corrupt practice alleged, affirmatively. Statement of allegation contained in the petition should therefore be precise and should clearly contain all the necessary details as required in terms of section 55 of the ROPA.
11.
 However in the present case, as noted earlier, none of the respondent No.1's witnesses deposed regarding the alleged instance pertaining to the various polling stations, as mentioned in the petition, and the polling stations whereabout the respondent No. 1's witnesses deposed were neither mentioned in the petition nor in the affidavit of evidence of the petitioner. Such evidence is therefore wholly irrelevant, inconsequential and is liable to be ignored, and cannot be thus taken into consideration. Even otherwise the evidence recorded on behalf of the petitioner in view of the foregoing analysis of such evidence does not at all prove that the appellant indulged in any corrupt practice or resorted to any undue influence to procure his success in the election.
12.
 We may also mention here that at the request of respondent No.1, the counterfoils of the used ballot papers, the used electoral list, and the statements of counts pertaining to all the polling stations of the constituency, were sent to National Database Registration Authority (""NADRA""), for forensic examination of the thumb impressions appended to the said counterfoils and used electoral list. However, as per the NADRA report it was only in respect of 229 counterfoils that the fingerprints failed authentication whereas the fingerprints which could not be deciphered, inter alia, due to use of poor quality/inappropriate ink were 99752, however such counterfoils did bear valid CNIC numbers of the voters, and therefore, and specially so in view of the fact that the difference of votes between appellant and respondent No.1 is 25328 votes, the NADRA report does not adversely affect the success of the appellant in the election.
13.
 In view of the foregoing, absolutely no case was made out for declaring the appellant's election void under section 68(d) of the ROPA, and or declaring the respondent No.1 as elected in terms of section 69 of the ROPA. We have also found that the Presiding Officer of the Election Tribunal has failed to function within the parameters of law and has grossly misunderstood and misapplied the relevant provisions of ROPA. The judgment also miserably suffers from non-reading and misreading of evidence which resulted in miscarriage of justice.
14.
 It was for the foregoing reasons that, we, through our short order dated 07.06.2017, allowed the above appeal and set aside the order impugned thereby.

Through instant bail application, applicant Asghar Ali seeks post arrest bail in Crime No.35/2016 registered at Police Station ANF Hyderabad, under sections 9(c), 14 and 15 of C.N.S. Act, 1997.
2.
 Precisely relevant facts are that on 27.09.2016, complainant along with his subordinate staff was present at PS where they received spy information that present applicant is bringing the huge quantity of narcotics for selling purpose. On such information, complainant along with his subordinate staff reached at the pointed place and saw the present applicant having one black shopper in his hand, who on seeing the police party tried to slip away. However, the present applicant was apprehended and during search recovery of 2.450 grams charas was affected from accused Property and accused were brought at Police Station. FIR was registered against the applicant. After usual investigation they were sent up for trial.
3.
 Learned counsel for the applicants inter alia contends that recovery affected from the applicant is 2.450 grams charas chemical report is delayed; no independent person has been cited as witness; applicant has no previous criminal record; investigation is completed; all the prosecution witnesses are police officials hence there is no question of tampering with the prosecution evidence. He lastly contended that applicant is behind the bar since last about 09 months.
4.
 Learned Special Prosecutor ANF opposed this application on the ground that this is a crime against society, however he concedes that there is no criminal history of applicant.
5.
 After careful consideration of contentions of learned counsel for the parties and meticulous examination of available record, alleged contraband narcotics is 2.450 grams charas. No private witnesses have been associated in spite of prior spy information received at the police station hence the complainant party least could have made an attempt to associate private mashirs from way or pointed place; there is a delay in sending the representative part for chemical examination which (delay) would also be required an explanation by prosecution hence making a room for further probe. Applicant has been in continuous custody since last about 09 months and are no more required for any purpose of investigation nor the prosecution has claimed any exceptional circumstance which could justify keeping the applicant behind the bars for an indefinite period. Moreover, prosecution has not claimed that the applicant is previously involved in same nature of the cases. All the prosecution witnesses are police officials hence there is no question of tampering with the evidence. Therefore, keeping peculiar facts of instant case; continuous detention of more than 09 months as well minimum punishment, which normally may be considered while dealing with bail plea, I am of the view that scale tilts in favour of the applicant for grant of bail as no useful purpose is likely to be served with further detention of applicant pending determination of his guilt.
6.
 Keeping in view the above given circumstances, prima facie, applicant has succeeded to bring his case within the purview of subsection (2) of section 497, Cr.P.C., for this reason, he is admitted to post arrest bail subject to furnishing solvent surety in the sum of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees fifty thousand) and P.R. Bond in the like amount to the satisfaction of trial Court.

According to this Act, the Board and the Executive Committee has its own functions. The Board has to formulate the policies and issued guidelines for implementation while the Executive Committee is responsible for implementation and to exercise financial and administrative powers as assigned to it. The Chief Executive Officer is the administrative head of the PEDO.
3.
 Section 5 (1) provides the criteria for appointment of Chief Executive Officer, which is reproduced as below:
""5(1). Government shall appoint the Chief Executive Officer of the Organization from amongst the persons having expertise in the field of energy and power section on such terms and conditions as the Government may determine"".
4.
 It is alleged that initially vide advertisement the post of Chief Executive Officer was advertised providing therein the qualification and experience in accordance with the PEDO Act, which is reproduced:---
 ""Candidates must hold at least Master Degree in Civil/ Electrical/Mechanical Engineering/Business Administration or C.A. Must have at least 25 years of post-qualification experience in the 
organization/companies dealing in Hydel/thermal power generation and power distribution.
i.
 5 years as head/CEO of any Power Project Construction Company/organization and proven track record of achievements.
ii.
 10 years Senior level experience in management of construction of power projects and transmission lines/Grids and distribution of power i.e. Pre-implementation, tendering contract negotiations, award of contract and its Implementations under all kinds of funding(Govt./International Donor Agencies). 
iii.
 Experience of interacting with NEPRA"".
5.
 It is alleged that again on 18.9.2014 malafidely the post of Chief Executive Officer, PEDO was re-advertized giving a completely different criteria, contrary to the Section 5(1) of the PEDO Act, 1993 Relevant para from the advertisement is reproduced:-
 ""Minimum of 15 years of experience in energy, power or Financial sectors with at least 3 years as CEO, MD, COO, CFO or Country Head in corporate entity (i.e. No.1 or 2 in corporate hierarchy) having annual turnover of more than 25 Billion"".
6.
 It is alleged that the respondent No.1 who has the political backing and close links with one Mr. Asad Umar, MNA-48 Islamabad, who is the Member of the Energy Apex Committee of this Province, was appointed in violation of merit and the criteria set in the Act ibid.
7.
 The respondents were put to notice, they filed their joint comments. Defending and denying any foul play in the matter of appointment of this important office of Chief Executive Officer. They summarized their defence in paras-3 to 5 of the comments, the same is reproduced for convenience:-
 ""Paragraphs 3 to 5 of the petition are refuted being misleading. In fact, when despite abundance of resources, SHYDO kept performing below par and miserably failed in materializing any mega projects, Government was constrained to re-examine and realign its priorities. Feedback from relevant stakeholders and interaction with other federal and provincial counterparts necessitated whole-scale changes in SHYDO. Not only an immediate need was felt to restructure and reorganize this floundering Organization but it was also felt that Province must harness other forms of energy and power besides merely hydro-electricity. This led the Government to bring substantial changes in SHYDO Act, 1993 through Act XIII of 2014, whereby not only the Organization was renamed to PEDO but besides restructuring the Board of PEDO many other important changes were also brought on the statute book. Bedrock and spirit of these statutory amendments were reorganizing this entity on corporate lines. It was also felt that business-as-usual would not bring any desired changes thus to foot the bills of future energy plans, Government has to run this organization through a corporate-sector led, lean Board with minimum government involvement, with a Chief Executive from corporate sector, who is capable of thinking out-of-the-box, who knows to leverage the resources well and has mastery to attract more and more investment through his connectivity and abilities of showcasing projects with potentials to maximize profits for government.
4.
 Para 6 of the petition needs elaboration. Criterion advertised through advertisement dated 04.04.2014 was prepared prior to promulgation of Act XIII of 2014 and was already in process of publication on 02.04.2014 when the Act received asset of the Governor and was accordingly notified. Criterion had no legal backing or mandate as PEDO Act, 1993 (as amended) does not postulate such cumbersome eligibility. Even otherwise, Board and the HR Committee and of reorganized PEDO was looking for a dynamic and talented individual with demonstrable expertise to run PEDO on corporate lines so that he may take PEDO to pinnacle of success besides coming up with out-of-box solutions to meet the outlay of hundreds of billions to execute the energy plan of the Province, especially when the Provincial coffers are grossly insufficient to meet such sizable fiscal requirements. This led the Board to go for a fresh round of advertisement. In case of any grievance against Board decision, petitioner or for that matter any of the candidates could have challenged such decision before competent forum.
5.
 Paragraphs 7 to 9 are vehemently denied being nothing but willful distortion and misstatements. The process of re-advertisement and consequent selection were open, fair and transparent. Respondent No.2, while substantially fulfilling the requirements of amended section 5(1) and while keeping in view required skill set for a corporative PEDO sought candidates having required expertise in energy and/or finance. Respondent No.1, who happens to have one of the shiniest profiles and a resplendent profile as corporate guru with sufficient experience of energy and power while working with another affiliate concern of E&P Department and Engro group, known for their energy exploits in Sindh applied for the post of CEO and after going through a long winded and thoroughly scrutinizing process, got recommended for appointment of the Board. The entire process was ensured to meet the highest standards of merits and was kept insulated from strongest of pressures and influences asserted by certain elements to perpetuate vested interest as well as to induct stereotypical incumbents with no corporate skills. Respondent No.2 clearly fulfills the criterion laid down in law. He was promised market-based salary at the time of hiring as per Board decision, in view of his multi-national exposure and his feats on top management positions both in country and abroad (at Japan, Papau New genie and Singapore). Petitioner has no legal right, character or entitlement to challenge either the appointment or for that matter the salary setting process of the respondent No.2"".
8.
 Learned counsel for the petitioner referred to para 5(1) of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Energy Development Organization Act, 1993 duly up-dated and amended vide PEDO (Amendment Act, 2014) and contended that this subsection is the only pre-requisite under the law for appointment against this public post of Chief Executive Officer and the plain reading of this subsection suggest that expert only in the field of Energy and Power sector would qualify to be appointed as Chief Executive Officer (PEDO). He argued that the authority of the government to appoint the Chief Executive Officer is structured one and confined within the four corners of law. Learned counsel for the petitioner then referred to the initial advertisement issued on 4.4.2014 and argued that there the qualification and experience mentioned placed emphasis on dealing with Hydel/Thermal Power Generation and Power Distribution but the amended advertisement dated 18.9.2014 introduced a complete different criteria for the appointment of Chief Executive Officer, wherein experience in financial sector was included as a substitute for the experience in energy and power. Learned counsel further argued that the respondents themselves carried out a short-listing process in which the respondent No.1 was placed at Sr. No.5 from amongst the (18) eligible candidates. However, having certain background of affiliation with an MNA and prominent leader of the Ruling Party of the Province, was preferred over the better candidates and appointed him. Learned counsel referred to the bio-data of the respondent No.1, wherein he claimed to have remained as Senior Business Analyst, Finance and Planning of Engro Chemical Pakistan Limited allegedly owned by the said MNA. Learned counsel argued that where the respondent No.1 was appointed in violation of law and was having no lawful authority to hold the post of Chief Executive Officer, the petitioner who is low paid employee of the respondent/organization, is merely placing information before this Court to proceed in the matter. He lastly argued that the appointment of respondent No.1 need to be strucked down to upheld the rule of law.
9.
 Learned Advocate General referred to the appointment letter of the respondent No.1 dated 18.2.2015 and argued that the Provincial Government is empowered to appoint the Chief Executive Officer of the Pakhtunkhwa Energy Development Organization on contract basis, because section 5(1) of the PEDO Act, 1993 empowered the Government to appoint on such terms and conditions as it may determined. Learned AG argued that the writ petition is filed for ulterior motives and referred to certain paras of the writ petition to contend that the petitioner's main grievance seems to be apprehending some service risk on the appointment of respondent No.1. He lastly argued that where there is mala fide on the part of the petitioner or personal interest, the writ of quo warranto cannot be entertained and placed reliance on 2004 SCMR 1299 and argued that on the touch stone of the judgment of the Apex Court, this writ petition is liable to be dismissed. 
10.
 Mr. Shumail Ahmad Butt, learned counsel representing the respondent No.1 argued that though the main emphasis of qualification is on experience in energy and power sector, but these sectors also include specialized person in financial matters, and therefore, the respondent No.1 having a vast experience in financial matters by referring to his bio-data contended that he fulfilled the criteria for appointment as mentioned in the PEDO Act, 1993. Learned counsel for respondent No.1 argued that despite the fact that this province had the potential of generation of about 4000 MW Electricity but the previous Regime for almost three decades could not even tape up to 100 MW. Learned counsel for respondent No.1 argued that on the appointment of the respondent No.1 a series of projects were initiated and are near completion. Learned counsel also referred to the CV of respondent No.1 and argued that the petitioner also remained Chief Finance Officer of KP Oil and Gas Company Limited and major financial and industrial concerns of this country. Learned counsel for the respondent No.1 argued that the energy and power cannot be taken in its restrictive sense, he referred to the definition given to the power in subsection xii of section 2 of the PEDO Act, 1993 whereby ""power"" includes hydraulic power, electrical, energy, steam, gas, thermal generation, alternative renewable sources of energy. He thus argued that merely a candidate having potential in Hydel cannot run the post and a dynamic candidate having expertise in all fields including power and finance could better run this public office. Learned counsel lastly argued that the Provincial Government has rightly exercised its authority and appointed respondent No.1 in the public interest. He also referred to different averments of the petition and contended that there is extreme mala fide on the part of the petitioner in questioning the appointment of respondent No.1, thus the writ petition is not maintainable.
11.
 Arguments heard and record perused.
12.
 This petition is filed under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 sub-article (b) (ii) of Article 199 deal with the writ of quo warranto. No doubt, that the issuance of writ under Article 199 of the constitution are discretionary but it is equally true that under the mandate of Article 199, it is not necessary that a person seeking writ of quo warranto must be aggrieved and no such restriction could be placed when Article 199 allow specifically. The Apex Court of this country held in so many judgments that where a petitioner simply laid information before the High Court regarding illegal appointments, he should not necessarily be aggrieved person. We are fortified in our view by the dictum laid down by the Apex Court in the following cases PLD 1974 SC 228, PLD 1975 SC 244, 1981 SCMR 74, PLD 1989 SC 166, 1998 SCMR 996, 2004 SCMR 1299 and 2007 SC 52.
13.
 Merely for the reason that the petitioner is an employee of the respondent/Organization cannot be considered as his mala fide, because the main averments are about the ineligibility of the respondent No.1 violation of law, and appointment of ineligible candidate on the post of Chief Executive Officer, PEDO, thus we only considered this writ petition as an information placed by the petitioner before this Court and held this petition as maintainable. Now coming to the basic question regarding the eligibility of the respondent No.1 to the post Chief Executive Officer, section 5 (1) of the PEDO Act, 1993 provides that the government shall appoint the Chief Executive Officer of the Organization from amongst the persons having expertise in the field of energy and power sector on such terms and conditions as the government may determine. There are two parts of this section, first; the one deal with the basic eligibility for the post of Chief Executive Officer while the second portion deal with the terms and conditions as may be agreed with the candidate or appointee or set by the government. Section 10 of the Act ibid prescribed the general powers and duties of the organization and framing of schemes. Subsection (2) of section 10 identifies the schemes on which the PEDO will focus i.e. i- the generation, transmission and distribution of power, ii-the construction, maintenance and preparation of power houses, grids and micro grids, transmission and distribution lines, specially in the remote mountainous areas of the province.
14.
 Keeping in view the powers and duties of the organization. Section 5 (1) of section 5 considers only those persons eligible who have expertise in the field of energy and power sector. The respondents have admitted that the respondent No.1 was expert in financial matter, the detail of which has been enumerated in his bio-data which was referred by both the parties. We found that the reference of the learned counsel for respondent No.1 to his position as Finance Officer of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Oil and Gas Company Limited is mis-placed as it suggests that he was posted against the said post in September, 2014 while the advertisement for the Chief Executive Officer PEDO was also published on 18.9.2014. We thus found that the expert on financial matters can never be a substitute for expert in energy and powers both are completely different fields, because section 2(xii) defines ""power"" includes hydraulic power, electrical energy, steam, gas, thermal generation, alternative renewable sources of energy"". The plain reading of the definition no where suggest to include any financial matter, similar is the case of energy the same is not defined in the PEDO Act, 1993 and where it is not so defined we can conveniently refer to its dictionary meaning given in Concise Oxford English Dictionary 11th Edition it defines energy as (i) the strength and vitality require for sustained activity ii) power derived from physical or chemical resources to provide light and heat or to work machine and iii) the property of matter and radiation which is manifest as a capacity to perform work.
15.
 We have before us also the record of the appointment process which provides that about (122) candidates applied for the position of Chief Executive Officer PEDO, of which (18) candidates were considered eligible and short-listed. Four candidates were given grand total of 55 marks while the respondent No.1 and remaining 14 candidates were given 52 scores. Interestingly in those short-listed candidates, there are other potential candidates, who have their experience both in energy and power and finances but the respondent No.1 was picked, having only experience in finances and then appointed to this very important post.
16.
 There is no cavil with the proposition that the Courts cannot assume the role of selection authority to determine the fitness of a candidate to be appointed to a particular post, but here the situation is completely different, the process of appointment to the post of Chief Executive Officer is in violation of merit, and that the basic ineligibility of the respondent No.1, whereby he cannot even be short-listed for the position of Chief Executive Officer. Merely because advertisement was manipulated to bring this candidate within the ambit of eligibility criteria would be of no help to him, where the parent law did not consider him to be eligible. The news reports and other documents placed on file by the petitioner though cannot be substantiated but in the background explained above; wherein ineligible candidate was selected, strengthen this contention that it was for extraneous consideration and political manoeuvring in appointing the respondent No.1 to the post of Chief Executive Officer.
17.
 In PLD 2011 SC 516, the Apex Court refused leave against the judgment of the High Court, whereby out of turn promotion of an Executive Engineer was strucked down in a writ of quo warranto. In PLD 2010 SC 817, the selection of a candidate to the parliament was strucked down for holding fake degree. In PLD 2016 SC 961, the appointments made in the Islamabad High Court in violation of merit and rules was strucked down by the Apex court, 2007 SCMR 97 and 1991 SCMR 2234, the judgments of High Court striking down the appointment of Secretary Pakistan Tobacco Board and Secretary Karachi Joint Water Board which were made in violation of law and rules were maintained.
18.
 The nutshell of the above discussion is, the notification dated 18.2.2015 regarding the appointment of respondent No.1 as Chief Executive Officer Pakhtunkhwa Energy Development Organization is declared as illegal without lawful authority and is strucked down, and declare the post of Chief Executive Officer Pakhtunkhwa Energy and Development Organization (PEDO) as vacant and direct the respondent to fill the post of Chief Executive Officer strictly in accordance with law.

 The supra titled writ petition has been addressed under section 44 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act, 1974, whereby, following relief is made:---
 ""In the circumstances enumerated above, it is humbly prayed that by accepting this constitutional petition, high Prerogative writs of mandamus, prohibition and others deemed expedient in the interest of justice, may kindly be issued directing respondents to finally settle the long standing issue of petitioner's service, by implementing and giving effect to the final orders of the competent authority/Prime Minister dated 26.10.2014, bearing No.P.M Secretariat 5821 dated 27.10.2014, and issue retrospective promotion order of petitioner, besides his reinstatement in service and superannuating retirement from service notifications w.e.f. 27.09.2009.

2.
 Precise facts of the case are that petitioner was serving as Secretary to Government in BPS-20. It is averred that competent authority/Prime Minister Azad Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir, approved promotion of petitioner as Senior Member Board of Revenue BPS-21, equivalent to post of Additional Chief Secretary General, i.e. from date of retirement of one Khalil Ahmed Qureshi, (the then SMBR), vide notification dated 02.12.1997, w.e.f. 16.05.1997. The said promotion order of petitioner was passed downwards to Chief Secretary/Secretary Services and General Administration Department, for implementation and issuance of formal notification as in those days there was no requirement or necessity of routing matter of promotion to posts of BPS-21, through Selection Board. The respondents instead of issuing formal notification, the decades back implemented and acted upon notifications of promotions of petitioner against the posts of Secretary to Government B-20, D.G. Information B-20, Director Information B-19, Deputy Director Information B-18, and Assistant Director B-17, were retrospectively recalled and ultimately he was dismissed from grade B-16, vide notification dated 01.04.1998. As all the aforesaid promotion notifications of petitioner were rescinded, who was also dismissed from service, hence, he constrained to challenge the said Government notification through Writ Petition No.215/1998, titled ""
Mujahid Husain Naqvi v. Azad Government and others
"", before this Court, which was accepted vide order dated 05.10.1999. The aforesaid order of this Court dated 05.10.1999, was challenged by respondents before the Supreme Court, in which, difference of opinion arose between two Hon'ble Judges of the Apex Court, resultantly, matter was placed before third Judge, who was at the then time, the Hon'ble Chief Justice (Mr. Justice Sardar Said Muhammad Khan). However, on application of petitioner, the learned Chief Justice, declined to hear the case, hence, the order of this Court was declared to be the judgment of the Supreme Court. It is alleged that Prime Minister of the time, granted sanction/approval for issuance of notification of reinstatement in service of petitioner in B-21, vide order dated 19.09.2009. It is further alleged that the Prime Minister also reaffirmed promotion order of petitioner in B-21, earlier passed on 02.12.1997. It is claimed that in the meantime, a bureaucratic conspiracy was hatched against petitioner by some interested persons and aforesaid order of the Prime Minister dated 19.09.2009, was recalled in so-called review, which was not competent because earlier orders were also passed upon review petition. It is contended that the learned Acting Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, as third Judge, dismissed the appeal filed by Government vide order dated 08.05.2010. Thereafter, number of orders were obtained by petitioner from the competent authority/Chief Executive of the State, for his reinstatement and retirement from service, which were revoked in sheer violation of law. It is stated that despite all obstacles petitioner was able to obtain new order from the Prime Minister on 26.10.2014, which was not implemented by respondents for mala fide reasons, hence, the instant constitution petition.
3.
 The writ petition has been resisted by respondents Nos.1 to 3 through comments, wherein, it is stated that petitioner was serving as Secretary to Government B-20, who tampered orders of the Prime Minister, against which, an inquiry was conducted as per the AJ&K Civil Servants (Efficiency and Discipline) Rules, 1977. After detailed inquiry, petitioner was reverted to lower rank and finally he was dismissed from service. The petitioner approached to this Court through writ petition No.215/1998, titled ""
Mujahid Hussain Naqvi v. Azad Government and others
"", which was accepted vide order dated 05.10.1999. Against the aforesaid order respondents filed an appeal before the Apex Court, however, the order passed by this Court was maintained vide judgment dated 09.09.2009. Against the aforesaid judgment dated 09.09.2009, a review petition was filed by respondents before the Apex Court, hence, while accepting review petition, appeal of Govt. was restored vide order dated 11.05.2011. It is maintained that the Supreme Court ultimately while accepting appeal filed by Government set aside order of this Court dated 05.10.1999. It is further submitted that appointment and all promotions of petitioner were recalled as unlawful, therefore, section 22 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Civil Servants Act, 1976, never attracted in the given case. It is urged that earlier matter of petitioner remained under active litigation from 1998 to 2012, up to the Supreme Court and had finally been decided, hence, submitted for dismissal of writ petition in limine.
4.
 The petitioner appeared in person and argued that with regard to reinstatement and retirement a valid order was passed by the Prime Minister of Azad Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir on 26.10.2014, however, same could not be acted upon by respondents for mala fide reasons. He further contended that although he was dismissed from service vide Government notification dated 09.05.1998, against which his writ petition was accepted by this Court through order dated 05.10.1999 and against the aforesaid order, respondents preferred an appeal before the Apex Court which was also dismissed. The petitioner emphasized that since 2010 to 2015, he remained almost unconscious, hence, he is not aware about any judgment of the Apex Court dated 09.10.2012. He finally craved for admission of writ petition, so that direction in the nature of mandamus may be issued against respondents jointly and severally to act upon order of the then Chief Executive dated 26.10.2014, relating to his re-instatement in service along with promotion in BPS-21 since 02.12.1997, followed by notification of retirement on reaching superannuation w.e.f. 27.09.2009.
5
 Mr. Asghar Ali Malik, the learned counsel for respondents, however, submitted that petitioner was dismissed from service on the ground of misconduct, vide Government notification dated 09.05.1998, against which he filed a writ petition before this Court, which was accepted through order dated 05.10.1999, however, Government-respondent and others preferred an appeal against the aforesaid order, which was ultimately accepted by the Apex Court and his writ petition was dismissed, through judgment dated 09.10.2012. He further contended that against the aforesaid judgment, petitioner also filed a Civil Miscellaneous No.429/2014, titled ""
Mujahid Hussain Naqvi v. Azad Government and others
"" which was also dismissed by the Apex Court through order dated 05.12.2015. The learned counsel pressed into service that petitioner concealed the above mentioned judgment and order of the Supreme Court and succeeded to obtain a baseless and concocted order from the Prime Minister dated 26.10.2014, which is not only violative of law but also against the judgment and order of the Apex Court, hence, submitted for dismissal of writ petition in limine.
6.
 We have heard petitioner at some length as well as the learned counsel for respondents, perused the contents of writ petition and examined the appended documents made available with utmost care.
7.
 A contemplate perusal of record reveals that petitioner while holding the post of Secretary to Government BPS-20, was proceeded against as per the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Civil Servants (Efficiency and Discipline) Rules, 1977 and after thorough probe of allegations was found that he had committed misconduct, hence, was reverted grade wise to BPS-20 to BPS-16 as Information Officer and then was dismissed from service through Government notification dated 09.05.1998. Against the aforesaid notification, petitioner instead of filing an appeal in Service Tribunal being civil servant, preferred Writ Petition No.215/ 1998, titled ""
Mujahid Hussain Naqvi v. Azad Government and others
"" before this Court, which was accepted, vide order dated 05.10.1999. Against the aforesaid order Government-respondent and others filed an appeal before the Apex Court, in which difference of opinion arose between two Hon'ble Judges, as a result whereof, matter was placed before the 3rd Judge, who was at the then time, the learned Chief Justice (Mr. Justice Sardar Said Muhammad Khan, as His Lordship then was). The petitioner, however, moved an application that His Lordship should not hear the case for the reasons mentioned in the application, whereupon, the learned Chief Justice declined to hear the case, vide order dated 01.08.2001. The Apex Court, however, finally accepted appeal of respondents vide Judgment dated 09.10.2012, wherein, in paragraphs Nos.13 and 18 of the report, it was observed as under:-
""13.
 We have heard the learned counsel for the appellants, perused the written arguments submitted by respondent No.1 as well as the judgment of the High Court. We propose to take up the argument of the respondents that since he had ceased to be a civil servant, he could not at the relevant time approach the Service Tribunal and the High Court had the jurisdiction to entertain, and decide the writ petition filed by him. After initiating the disciplinary proceedings against the respondent, some administrative orders were also passed by the Government, whereby the respondent was demoted from the post of Secretary to Government as a Director General and ultimately as Information Officer B-16. All orders of demotion have been set aside by the High Court. In the instant appeal, it has been contended by the appellants that the High Court had no jurisdiction to set aside the aforesaid orders of demotion of the respondent because it was the Service Tribunal which had the exclusive jurisdiction to deal with the matter. The orders of demotion of respondent from the post of Secretary to Government to the post of Director General was passed on 26.03.1998, from the post of Director General to the post of Director on 27.03.1998, from the post of Director to the post of Deputy Director on 30.03.1998 and finally from the post of Deputy Director to the post of Information Officer on 1.4.1998. The assertion of the respondent is that when the amendment was carried out on 28.2.1999, a civil servant could file an appeal before the Service Tribunal. The expression 'civil servant' has been defined in section 2 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Civil Servants Act, 1976 which reads as under:---
""2.
 Definitions:- In this Act, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context;
(a)
(b)
 'Civil Servant' means a person or holds a civil post in the service of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, employed in connection with the affairs of the State, but does not include:-
(i)
(ii)
(iii) 
 The final order of reversion of the respondent was passed on 1.4.1998 and he remained in service till 9.5.1998; the date when he was dismissed from service. He filed three appeals before the Service Tribunal to challenge the orders of his reversion. The appeals were pending before the Service Tribunal when he was dismissed from service. However, later on he withdrew the appeals and filed a consolidated writ petition to challenge all the orders, including the order of his dismissal from service. It is clear that cause of action arose to the respondent in respect of his reversion orders on four different dates, i.e., 26.3.1998, 27.3.1998, 30.3.1998 and 1.4.1998. When these causes of action arose his appeals before the Service Tribunal were maintainable and it was only the Service Tribunal which had the jurisdiction to decide whether the reversion orders were validly passed or not. The respondent had filed appeal before the Service Tribunal which was the competent forum. The dismissal of the respondent from service did not have the effect of taking away the jurisdiction from the Service Tribunal to decide the appeals. Therefore, the respondent wrongly withdrew the appeals from the Service Tribunal. According to section 47 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act, 1974, the High Court has no jurisdiction to entertain a dispute over which the Service Tribunal has the exclusive jurisdiction. It was the duty of the High Court to first determine the question of its jurisdiction before passing the impugned judgment. In these circumstances the writ petition filed by orders was not maintainable. Therefore, it can safely be held that the High Court had no jurisdiction to entertain a writ petition in respect of the reversion orders passed against the respondent.
18.
 Now we advert to the crucial question, i.e., whether the High Court has rightly set aside the finding of fact recorded by the Prime Minister being an administrative Authority. It is celebrated principle of law that finding of fact recorded by an administrative Authority performing functions under a statute is sacrosanct. It is also settled now that the High Court, while exercising writ jurisdiction cannot substitute its opinion for the opinion of the administrative Authority. The High Court has held that actually the Prime Minister had ordered the promotion of the respondent to grade B-21 and by implication, there was no forgery. The order of dismissal passed by the Prime Minister on 9.5.1998, after holding that the respondent was guilty of forgery was available before the High Court. In the aforesaid order it was stated that the competent Authority (the Prime Minister) had come to the conclusion in the light of the proceedings taken under notification dated 11.3.1998, that respondent, herein, had tampered with the order passed by the Prime Minister on 02.12.1997. It was also stated in the notification dated 11.3.1998, that the Prime Minister acting as Authority under the E&D Rules, 1977, had directed for initiation of disciplinary proceedings against the respondent on the ground that he had interpolated the order passed by the Prime Minister. After due process, the charge was held to be proved. The finding was recorded by the Prime Minister in his capacity as the Authority under rule 8 of the E&D Rules, 1977. Rule 8 of the E&D Rules, 1977 may advantageously be reproduced below:--

 Action by the Authority,- In the case of any proceedings the record of which has been reported for (sic) or rule 7-A, the authority may pass such orders as it deems fit but before imposing a major penalty, the authority shall afford the accused an opportunity of being heard in person, either before himself or before an officer senior in rank to the accused designated for the purpose after taking into consideration the record of such personal hearing prepared by the officer so designated.
 The assertion of the respondent, the Prime Minister himself allegedly has passed the promotion order of respondent. If it was, so, then there was no question that the Prime Minister could have made a false statement that respondent had been guilty of tampering. The averments made in the written statement filed by the appellants, herein, before the High Court, are fully supported by the record summoned from the Services and General Administration Department but the High Court failed to give any finding on it. The record shows that two orders were passed by the Prime Minister in which he stated that the respondent had interpolated his order dated 2.12.1997. On 20.1.1998, an order was passed by the Prime Minister whereby he ordered that disciplinary action may be taken against the respondent. On 5.3.1998, a similar order was passed by the Prime Minister which is a detailed order in which he has pointed out the exact interpolation and tampering and confirmed the earlier order for initiating disciplinary proceedings against the respondent. Later on when the authorized officer submitted his report to the Prime Minister, the same was accepted and it was ordered that the respondent be dismissed from service for misconduct. The High Court failed to consider these orders properly.
 It may be observed that the order dated 2.12.1997 which according to the respondent, is an un-tampered is itself contradictory and shows that it had been tampered with. For better understanding the position, here we again reproduce the alleged order passed by the Prime Minister. The order reads as under:-
 The perusal of the above order reveals that it has two parts. In its one part, the Prime Minister has directed the Chief Secretary to hear the parties and take further proceedings in the case and in the other part, while accepting the review petition, the Prime Minister has promoted the respondent to grade B-21. In these circumstances the Prime Minister was justified to hold that the order has been tampered with. In presence of the above said material, the observation of the High Court that if the Prime Minister's order had been tampered with, he should have said so rather than withdrawing it, is merely conjectural and it is settled that conjectures cannot take the place of proof. Therefore, we have no hesitation in holding that the High Court has erred in holding that the order passed by the Prime Minister had not been tampered with which finding of the High Court is set aside accordantly.""
 Again in paragraphs Nos.21 and 24 of the report, it was held as follows:-
""21.
 There is still another contention of the respondent that while passing the dismissal order against the respondent, rule 8 of the E&D Rules, 1977 has been violated because fresh notice was not issued by the Authority before passing the said order. A perusal of rule 8, reproduced in the earlier part of this judgment, shows that it does not contain that a fresh notice shall be given to the accused civil servant. However, it provides that the Authority shall afford an opportunity of being heard. As we have observed earlier that in the initial stages all efforts were made for the appearance of the respondent to show cause but on one pretext or the other he failed to appear and show-cause, therefore, it is clear that he was not interested in showing cause. It can safely be held that he had no explanation to give, therefore, there was no occasion for the Authority to provide any opportunity of hearing to the respondent. In our estimation, the opportunity of hearing under rule 8 is only to be provided to a person who has joined the proceedings and has submitted his explanation. It may be stated here that on presentation of the report by the Authorized Officer, the Prime Minister observed that since the accused exhibited non-cooperation with the Authorized Officer by firstly refusing to receive the notice and subsequently by abstaining from filing a written explanation, it was not possible to give him personal hearing.
 Thus, the objection raised by the respondent that no fresh notice was issued to him by the Authority has no force and is hereby repelled.
24.
 Before parting with the judgment, it may be observed that it is a fit case in which the criminal proceedings should be ordered but keeping in view the bad health of the respondent, the dismissal of the writ petition and restoration of the order passed by the Authority will meet the ends of justice.
 In light of what has been discussed above while accepting this appeal and setting aside the judgment of the High Court dated 5.10.1999, the writ petition filed by the respondent is dismissed with no order as to costs.""
8.
 The petitioner concealed the aforesaid judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court dated 09.10.2012, and preferred an application before the Prime Minister who passed the following order:-
9.
 A perusal of application of petitioner reveals that petitioner has deliberately concealed the judgment of the Apex Court dated 09.10.2012, and by suppressing fact succeeded to obtain a void order of his reinstatement and promotion in BPS-21 since 02.12.1997, as well as retirement after attaining age of superannuation w.e.f. 27.09.2009, who has not invoked jurisdiction of this Court with clean hands, therefore, is not entitled to equitable relief of writ jurisdiction. A similar proposition came under consideration before the Apex Court in case titled 
Azad Government and 03 others v. Abdul Ghaffar Butt and 02 others
 [1999 PLC (C.S.) 1203], wherein, at page 1207 of the report it was held as follows:-
""9.
 The contention of the learned counsel for the appellants that even if the allotment in favour of the appellants is void, that should have been challenged by the respondent before the appropriate authority otherwise it cannot be ignored, does not help his case. Because it was the appellants who filed the writ petition in the High Court and it has been repeatedly held by this Court that a person who seeks relief by invoking writ jurisdiction must come with clean hands; if a person bases his claim on a void order, he is not entitled to any relief in exercise of writ jurisdiction.""
The same point came under consideration before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case titled ""
Abid Hussain Jafri and others v. Azad Government and others
"", [1998 PLC (C.S.) 141]. At page 144 of the report, it was opined as follows:-
 "" This is well settled principle of law that a person seeking redress of his grievance by resorting to the writ jurisdiction, must come with clean hands. If it is found that the person seeking relief by way of writ petition has no legal or moral case, then irrespective of the fact that the Chief Secretary or, for that matter, any other departmental authority is bound to obey the orders of the Prime Minister, the High Court may refuse to issue a writ of mandamus in exercise of its discretionary powers vested in it. As the order which was sought to be implemented by the appellants was passed in violation of the principle of 'audi-alteram-partem', the High Court could rightly refuse to issue a writ of mandamus for the implementation of the same irrespective of the fact as to whether the Secretary Works was bound to carry out the same or not. The writ jurisdiction cannot be exercised in perpetuation of an illegal order.""
The similar point was resolved by the Lahore High Court, in case titled 
""Iqtedar Hyder v . Bank of Punjab through its Chairman and another
"", [2001 MLD 1537]. At page 1540 of the report, it was held as follows:-
 ""----It is also settled principle of law that he who seeks equity must come to the Court with clean hands. It is pertinent to mention here that decree was passed against petitioner on 12.09.1998 and petitioner did not agitate the same before this Court by way of appeal nor filed any objection petition before the executing Court. In this view of the matter I am not inclined to exercise my discretion in favour of petitioner"".
10.
 The petitioner, therefore, filed the instant writ petition with unclean hands which is ex-facie frivolous, as well as, contemptuous to frustrate the judgment and order of the Apex Court of the country.
11.
 The contention of petitioner that he remained almost unconscious from 2010 to 2015, seems to be falsified. A perusal of judgment of the Apex Court dated 09.10.2012, makes it abundantly clear that he himself argued his case and pleaded each and every point pertaining to prove his dismissal order as unlawful and each point was authoritatively resolved by the Apex Court of the country. He later on also moved an application for recalling judgment dated 09.10.2012, which too was argued by him. The application was turned down by the Hon'ble Court through order dated 05.12.2015, which proved that his assertion about unconsciousness since 2010 to 2015, is falsified. Even otherwise, the aforesaid point has not been raised by petitioner in memorandum of his writ petition. It is well settled principle of law that a party cannot be allowed to argue its case vis- -vis to pleadings. The aforesaid point was considered by the Apex Court in case titled ""
Azad Government and others v. Qamar-uz-Zaman Khan Niazi
"" (1993 SCR 9). At page 13 of the report, it was held as follows:-
 ""Before going into the merits of case we would like to dispose of this application. The application has been filed under rule 6 of Order IX read with Order XLIII of the Supreme Court Rules and is basically aimed at seeking permission of the Court to file affidavits of the Additional Chief Secretary (General) and the counsel for the appellants. However, a closer look at the contents of the application as well as affidavit shows that practically the appellants are seeking to set up a new case which is entirely inconsistent with the case before the Service Tribunal. As has already been noted, before the Service Tribunal the application which was claimed to have been filed by Qamar-uz-Zaman Niazi containing the conditions of thirty years pension and move-over to grade 19 had been accepted as genuine. In fact it had been clearly stated in the written statement that the Government acted in accordance with law by acceding to the request for retirement as it was authorized by law to pass an order of retirement but did not accept the conditions imposed by Qamar-uz-Zaman Niazi because the same were illegal and could not have been legally accepted. Now before us the Government wants us to hold that the application submitted by Qamar-uz-Zaman Niazi imposing the conditions mentioned above had been returned and another application claimed to have been filed by Qamar-uz-Zarnan Niazi was subsequently processed and in this application Qamar-uz-Zaman Niazi had asked for retirement on completion of 25 years of service. It is well settled that no party can be allowed to set up a case different from a case which had been set up in the pleadings. Apart from that the point at issue is a pure question of fact which can only be decided after taking of fresh evidence. It is equally well settled that a question of fact cannot be raised for the first time in this Court. Without commenting on genuineness or otherwise of the application claimed by the Government to have been filed subsequently by Qamar-uz-Zaman Niazi, we may point out that the copy placed on the record of this Court is a photo copy and is not attested by any officer of the Government. It is only attested by counsel for the appellants. In law a copy can only be issued and certified by a person who has custody of the original document. Admittedly the learned counsel for the appellants is not such a person. Even in the Government file the original, if any, is not available. It cannot, therefore, be positively proved that this application was in fact filed""
The same view was reiterated by the apex Court in case titled ""
Muhammad Hussain v. Abdul Majid and others
"" (1993 SCR 319), wherein at page 321 of the report, it was opined as under:-
 ""It may be stated that this is well settled principle of law that the parties cannot depart from the case as set up in their pleadings and vary the same subsequently at the appellate stage. The parties are bound by their pleadings and even if evidence is led in support of a plea which was not set up in the pleadings, such evidence cannot be looked into. Thus, the High Court has not committed any error in holding that the appellant cannot be permitted to put up altogether a different case from the one which he had set up in the plaint. It may be stated that according to the plaint, each of the share, i.e., 1/3 each, and the mutation was also attested in the year 1958 in accordance to the terms of the decree of the Deputy Custodian. Thus, it does not lie in the mouth of the appellant at the appellate stage to change his stand and argue that he was entitled to more than 1/3 share which he had according to the decree of the Deputy Custodian on the basis of which mutation was also attested.""
The aforesaid view was again highlighted by August Supreme Court in case titled 
""Sheikh Javed Iqbal v. Muhammad Bashir and 5 others""
 (2010 PLC (C.S.) 1264). At page 1268 of the report, it was observed as follows:-
 ""It is celebrated principle of law that no party can travel beyond its pleadings. Respondent No.1 has categorically taken a stand in para 9 of memo. of appeal before the Service Tribunal that no adverse order was communicated to him and he got knowledge of all the orders passed by the departmental authorities on service of order dated 18.09.2009. This factual assertion of the respondent has not been denied by the present appellant and pro forma respondents.""
12.
 The epitome of above discussion is that, finding no substance in the instant writ petition, the same is hereby dismissed in limine with special costs of Rs.50,000/- to be deposited with the ""Nazir"" of this Court, within fortnight period.

 The petitioner has invoked the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 with the following relief:
""It is therefore, humbly prayed that on acceptance of this writ petition the order of respondent No.1 dated 27.08.2012 may graciously be set aside and declared the order of respondent No.1 as null, void and of no legal effect.""
2.
 Brief facts of the case are that land situated in Khata No.44 to 48, Mouza Saro Shah District Mardan measuring area 13169 PIUs i.e. 222 acres, 04 Kanals and 13 Marlas was resumed under Land Reforms Regulation No.115 and Land Reforms Act II of 1977 on 04.01.1977 from late Mir Afzal Khan the landlord of the area. After resumption the management of Sarfaraz Khan District Hospital Charity Trust, applied for the grant of lease for the said resumed land which was granted and said land was leased out for 10 years w.e.f. 24.12.1977 vide lease dated 25.03.1980 by the then Deputy Land Commissioner with certain conditions particularly submission of declaration and afterward lease was extended for next 30 years which was to be expired in the year 1987. The Federal Land Commission (hereinafter called as FLC) cancelled the lease vide judgment dated 18.02.1990 and Sarfaraz Khan District Hospital Charity Fund feeling aggrieved filed writ petition which was allowed and case was remanded to respondent No.1 for decision afresh, however against the same remand order, the tenants/respondents No.2 to 102 feeling aggrieved filed Civil Petition before the Honourable Supreme Court but the above said remand order passed by this Court was upheld by the Honourable Supreme Court. The Federal Land Commission vide order dated 28.03.1993 withdrew the notice by holding that Federal Land Commission has got no jurisdiction to revise the order of President of Pakistan, however in the year 2011 Sarfaraz Khan Charity Trust surrendered the same resumed land to the Provincial Land Reforms Commission. Thereafter, the present respondents Nos.2 to 102 filed application for cancellation of lease in favour of Sarfaraz Khan Charity Trust and allotment of same resumed land to them being sitting landless tenants which application was dismissed vide order dated 01.01.2012 by the Deputy Land Reforms Commissioner Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The relevant portion of order is reproduced below:
""I am directed to refer your letter No.104/LR dated 17.12.2011 of the subject noted above and to say that the lease in favour of Mr. Sarfaraz Khan Charity Fund needs to be cancelled by the authority that sanction it. As far as allotment of land to sitting tenants presently there is no scheme of government and should not be done.""
The tenants/respondents Nos.2 to 102 feeling aggrieved from the aforesaid order dated 01.01.2012 challenged same order before the learned Chairman Federal Land Commission/respondent No.1 by filing revision petition i.e. RP.3(30)/FLC/2012 which after hearing was allowed vide order dated 27.08.2012 and respondents No.1/Deputy Land Reforms Commissioner, Mardan was directed to implement the above said order dated 27.08.2012 for distributing/allotting the said resumed land amongst the sitting tenants i.e. respondents Nos.2 to 102. The present petitioners feeling aggrieved from the order dated 27.08.2012 of respondent No.1/Chairman Federal Land Commission, Islamabad filed instant petition on the grounds mentioned therein. During pendency of the instant petition, CM No.291-P/2017 was filed for impleadment of legal heirs of Mir Afzal Khan as party which was allowed vide order dated 17.01.2017.
3.
 Arguments heard. Record perused.
4.
 From the perusal of record it reveals and is admitted position that land in question was resumed under MLR 115 and Land Reforms Act, 1977 by the Federal Land Reforms Commission but instead of distributing the resumed land to the sitting tenants, it was leased out firstly for 10 years to the Sarfaraz Charity Trust which afterward was extended for 30 years onward by the Provincial Land Reforms Commission. The Chairman Federal Land Commission on report of head of the investigation team of FLC took cognizance of the matter of lease of resumed land to the Trust who vide its order/judgment dated 18.02.1990, cancelled the same lease. The said order dated 18.02.1990 was challenged by Sarfaraz Khan Charity Trust by filing writ petition No.140/1990 which was partially allowed as discussed above and tenants/presents respondents Nos.2 to 102 feeling aggrieved from the judgment of this Court dated 23.02.1992, filed Civil Petition No.51-P/1992 before the Hon'ble Apex Court who vide order/judgment maintained the order/judgment of this Court dated 30.02.1992. Lastly, the Senior Member FLC vide order dated 28.03.1993 vacated the notice issued to the Trust and filed the case. In the meanwhile in the year 2011 the said Sarfaraz Khan Hospital Charity Trust surrendered the same resumed land to the Provincial Land Reforms Commission, upon which the sitting tenants/respondents Nos.2 to 102 moved application for cancellation of lease to the Trust and allotment of the same land to them i.e. respondents Nos.2 to 102 which application was turned down despite No Objection Certificate by the Trust vide order dated 01.01.2012, passed by Deputy Land Commissioner, so the same order was challenged by the present respondents Nos.2 to 102 by filing Revision Petition i.e. RP.3(530)/FLC/2012 which petition after hearing was allowed. The relevant Paragraph of the order, passed by the learned Chairman Federal Land Commission, Islamabad is reproduced as below:
""In view of the foregoing arguments of the learned counsel for the petitioners, position available on file relating to the claim of the petitioners and considering the possession of the sitting tenants along with provisions of paragraph 18 of the Land Reforms Regulations, 1972 I hereby accept the instant petition and allot the land mentioned in the respective khata numbers available in the revenue record, which provide the names of tenants before this Court. This allotment is made under the provisions of paragraph 18(3) of MLR-115/72 according to the possession of the tenants. The stance taken in the para-wise comments by the Provincial Land Reforms Authorities is not legal and against the norms of justice and is also without jurisdiction. The stand taken in the said comments is also against the preamble of the Land Reforms Regulation, 1972 and the Land Reforms Act, 1977, as it purely favours the rights of tenants and the supreme cause given in the preamble relates to the uplift of peasantry i.e. the tenant class. Hence, the directions issued by the Respondents Nos.1, 2 and 3 are set aside as being without lawful authority and of no legal effect. Deputy Land Commissioner, Mardan/Revenue Staff of the concerned halqa are directed to implement this order of allotment in the revenue record in favour of the petitioners, which have been mentioned in the petition, and is attached with this order. However, land allotted to the tenants shall not exceed 100 kanals or 12-1/2 acres as given in the Regulations/Act DLC, Mardan is further directed to submit compliance report of this order to the Register, FLC within a fortnight on its official receipt.""
5.
 Here it is pertinent to mention that the office of Advocate General Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar was consulted by the SMBR for legal opinion in view of judgment passed in Revision Petition RP.3 (530)/FLC/2012. The office of Advocate General put forward his opinion which is reproduced as below:
 After resumption of land despite distributing it to the peasantry it was delivered to the same land owner in the name of charitable trust which offended the very cause of Land Reforms and now since the Charity Trust has surrendered it and have got no objection, so if the same land is allotted to the sitting tenants, therefore, he opined that:
""I do not see any reason why the same shall not be given to the peasants within the terms of the law on the subject.""
6.
 Though the previous lease holder i.e. said Charity Trust has no concern with the resumed land even then the management of said Trust submitted No Objection Certificate (NOC) signed by the Admn: Manager Premier Sugar Mills Retired Major Shoukat Ali Khan dated 13.09.2011 that the Charity Trust has got no objection if the same resumed land is allotted to the sitting tenants. The revenue record annexed with the writ petition also supports that respondents Nos.2 to 102 are sitting tenants of the land at the time of resumption and during lease period of said Trust, so the respondents Nos.2 to 102 are coming tenants of the resumed land since their forefathers.
7.
 Thus after examining the record and the case law on the subject, this Court is of the view that first of all the petitioners have no locus standi and cause of action to file the instant petition to challenge the order, passed by Chairman FLC which is superior forum in the hierarchy of Federal Land Reforms Commission. Secondly, the land was basically resumed from original land owners for its aim and purpose of distribution/allotment to the sitting tenants and not to government officers whether Federal or Provincial or lease it out to someone else instead of tenant under the Land Reforms Laws in any garb, however after the judgment passed in Qazalbash's case cited as PLD 1990 SC 99, vide which fresh resumption of land for the purpose of Land Reforms was declared against the injunctions of Islam but it was not held in said judgment that resumed land for the purpose and aim to distribute it to the landless tenants will not be distributed or allotted to the sitting landless tenants and has not given any direction that instead of allotting resumed land to the landless tenants, it be allotted to officers or employees of Federal as well as Provincial Government employees or to lease it out or to utilize it against the aim and object of the Land Reforms Laws rather resumption made from 1972 under MLR 115 and ibid Act, 1977 was saved. In the instant case it has been noticed that instead of distributing the same resumed land to the sitting tenants, it was leased out to the original owner in the name of Trust who in turn received millions of rupees from the old sitting tenants. So the order dated 27.08.2012 impugned herein passed by Chairman FLC is in accordance with Land Reforms Laws and is not against the injunctions of Islam.
8.
 This Court found no any illegality in it rather the same order dated 27.08.2012 is a step for the accomplishment of object and purpose of Land Reforms Program for which land in excess of determined ceiling was resumed to distribute it to the sitting landless tenants, so in the instant case tenants/respondents Nos.2 to 102 were entitled for allotment since the resumption of land under Land Reforms Regulation and ibid Act, 1977, hence their right for allotment subsisted by the operation of law as the laws are still in field, it requires no any scheme by the Provincial government for the distribution of resumed land, therefore, the Chairman FLC had correctly set aside the order passed by Deputy Land Commissioner, Mardan dated 01.01.2012. Moreover, the land resumed has not been freshly resumed from the original land owner but it was resumed only with aim, object and purpose to allot/donate the same to the sitting landless tenants for same purpose Land Reforms Commission was constituted and due to inaction of Federal Land Reforms Commission from the date of resumption by not allotting resumed land to sitting tenants shall not be affected adversely, so the cut date in Qazalbash's case dated 23.03.1990 does not create any hurdle for allotment of resumed land to the landless sitting tenants according to Land Reforms Laws, Rules and Regulations.
9.
 Moreso, resumption of land under Land Reforms Laws has been saved in the judgment of Qazalbash's case, so the original land owners though after resumption has no concern whatsoever with the resumed land even then in the instant case he/they have got no objection as discussed above if the same resumed land is distributed amongst sitting tenants i.e. respondents Nos.2 to 102. This Court is of the view that if the said resumed land is utilized other than the purpose ordained in the Land Reforms Laws, then it would be great injustice to the sitting tenants and would amount making Land Reforms Laws as effectless on one pretext or the other. Moreover, the Land Reforms Laws are still in field and the Parliament of Pakistan has not repealed these laws, so are effective from the date of their commencement. It is further observed that different land Mafias including the officers of Federal as well as of Provincial government employees are behind such resumed and other government lands to grab it which is very unfortunate, so the concerned Land Reforms Commission's officers must take notice of it and distribute the resumed land in K.P.K to the sitting tenants as they are holding their offices for the accomplishment and fulfillment of very purpose and object of Land Reforms Program as huge amount in form of salaries is paid to the employees of the commission.
10.
 Thus what has been discussed above, we are of the view that this petition being bereft of merits, is dismissed.

 MOHAMMAD IBRAHIM KHAN, J.--
By this writ petition Shafiullah the Petitioner herein, has set in the following prayer:-
""In the light of the above and many other grounds to be advanced at the time of hearing with the prior permission of this Hon'ble Court, it is therefore, humbly prayed that consequent upon, the acceptance of this writ petition, the impugned order of lower Appellate Court (Respondent No. 7) dated 06.06.2013 may kindly be declared illegal, unlawful, unconstitutional, against law and natural justice, and the Respondents Nos. I and 2 may kindly be held responsible for the payment of decretal amount which is outstanding against the original judgment debtor, as they stood surety for the payment during the pendency of the original suit by filing affidavit in this regard, and the Respondent No.8 be directed to proceed against the Respondents Nos. 1 and 2 according to law.
Any other remedy coupled with cost, which is efficacious and appropriate, in peculiar circumstances of the case, may please be graciously granted though not specifically prayed for.""
2.
 In essence the grievance of the Petitioner is that he had filed a suit for declaration cum permanent injunction against the predecessor-in-interest of the Respondents Nos. 3 to 6 and Manager Habib Bank Chakisar Branch on account of being owner of the house bearing Khasra No. 1928 situated within the local limits of Mauza Chakisar. The said house was crumbled down in the earthquake occurred in the year 2005 and predecessor-in-interest of the Respondents Nos. 3 to 6 was tenant-at-will in the said house, so, he has no right to construct the same or receive compensation in lieu of it from the government exchequer, which has been issued to the earthquake affectees in the year 2006. During the pendency of this Civil Suit No. 23/1, the Petitioner moved an application for obtaining temporary injunction, which was dismissed by the learned Trial Court on 17.07.2007 mainly on the pretext that learned counsel for the Defendant/Respondents Nos. 1 and 2 furnished an affidavit that they will pay double amount in case of decree in favour of the Petitioner (hereinbefore called as Plaintiff).
3.
 After grant of decree in favour of Petitioner (hereinbefore called as Plaintiff), an appeal was preferred bearing No. 144/13 of the year 2010 on behalf of the Respondents Nos. 1 and 2, which was also answered in negative vide the order dated 13.10.2011 by the learned District Judge/Zila Qazi Shangla and being not assailed further the said order has attained finality. For satisfaction of the decree, the Petitioner (hereinbefore called as Plaintiff/decree-holder) filed execution petition before the learned Executing Court i.e. Respondent No. 8 by adding names of the Respondents Nos. 1 and 2 in the column of judgment debtors. The other part filed cross-objection petition bearing No. 1/11 of the year 2012 before the learned Executing Court, which was left undecided as learned appellate Court suspended the execution proceedings in wake of the pendency of civil revision bearing No. 19/5 of 2012. In the meanwhile, the Respondents Nos. 1 and 2 submitted revision petition for deletion of their names from the panel of judgment debtors in the execution proceedings, which was allowed vide the impugned order dated 06.06.2013, resultantly names of the Respondents Nos. 1 and 2 were deleted from the list of judgment debtors. Having no other alternate remedy the Petitioner/decree-holder approached this Court through the writ petition in hand inter alia on the grounds mentioned therein.
4.
 Having heard arguments of learned counsel for the Petitioner, while despite hectic efforts service of the Respondents could not be procured, hence most of them have been placed ex parte.
5.
 The impugned order dated 06.06.2016 is gone through, it reveals that the Petitioners, who were herein the Respondents, were not arrayed party in the original suit bearing No. 23/1 decided by the learned Civil Court, therefore no decree was passed against each of the judgment debtor in the execution proceedings. Hence, the petition was accepted and names of the Petitioners herein now the Respondents/judgment debtors in the execution proceedings of the decree dated 24.5.2010 were deleted from file No. 2/10 of 2012 pending adjudication before the learned Executing Court, Chakisar.
6.
 Hence the impugned order in view of the provisions of section 145 (1) of the Civil Procedure Code has not been passed in accordance with law, which reads as under:-
145. 
Enforcement of liability of surety
.- Where any person has become liable as surety--
 (a) for the performance of any decree or any part thereof, or
 (b) for the restitution of any property taken in execution of a decree, or
(c) for payment of any money, or for the fulfillment of any condition imposed on any person, under an order of the Court in any suit or in any proceedings consequent thereon,
the decree or order may be executed against him, to the extent to which he has rendered himself personally liable, in the manner herein provided for the execution of decrees, and such person shall, for the purpose of appeal, be deemed a party within the meaning of Section 47.
Provided that such notice as the Court in each case thinks sufficient has been given to the surety.
7.
 During pendency of the execution proceedings an objection petition was filed before the learned executing Court, wherein it was specifically mentioned therein in Para V in respect of taking over of the responsibility by sureties/guarantors for payment of an amount released from the government exchequer for renovation of the house damaged during the earthquake which was withdrawn from Habib Bank Chakisar Branch. It has also been held in 2002 CLC 451 ""Habib Bank Limited v. Malik Ata Muhammad and 4 others"". The relevant citations (a) & (e) are reproduced as under:-
 (a) Civil Procedure Code (V of 1908)
Ss. 47 & 145. Execution of decree. Liability of surety. Surety not arrayed as party to suit or appeal. Execution of decree against such surety. Validity. Decree passed against a judgment-debtor could also be executed against such surety, which was not even arrayed as a party to suit or appeal. Liability of the surety was co-extensive with the judgment-debtor and continued till such tune that the decree was either satisfied by the judgment-debtor or by the surety.
 (e) Civil Procedure Code (V of 1908)
Ss. 147 & 96. Liability of surety. Scope. Appeal was continuation of suit. If appeal was accepted, the liability of the surety was revived. Such revived liability could be enforced against the surety.
8.
 Under the Contract Act, 1872 that even a guarantor can only be burdened to the extent and in accordance with the terms of the guarantee executed by him. In this respect, reliance has been placed on 2002 CLD 509 ""Mst. Parveen Amir v. National Bank of Pakistan and 3 others"". The relevant citation (b) is reproduced as under:--
 (b) Contract Act (IX of 1872)
...Ss. 126 & 128. Liability of guarantor. Extent. Guarantor could only be burdened to the extent and in accordance with the terms of guarantee executed by him.""
 The liability of the guarantor being co-extensive with judgment debtor and surety is liable by all means to fulfill his commitment in respect of the payment with regard to which he has taken the responsibility for its payment. The learned Executing Court can lawfully proceed against the sureties for the recovery of the amount to the extent of decree, thus, the names of the Respondents Nos. 1 and 2 were unlawfully deleted from the panel of judgment debtors in the execution proceedings by acceptance of the revision petition by the learned District Judge/Zila Qazi Shangla through the impugned order, which stands set aside, the sureties cannot be exempted from the liability of the payment in such hasty manner in violation of the provision of Section 145(1) of the Civil Procedure Code.
9.
 It is as learnt that out of the Respondents, Saifullah Khan, Respondent No. 1 has died, so his Legal Heirs are liable to pay the decretal amount in equal share, while the Respondent No. 2 Zahid Ali has been placed ex parte as he was only interested to defend his rights in this writ petition.
10.
 Copy of this judgment be placed before the learned Executing Court for the recovery of decretal amount from guarantors/ sureties, exclusively who shall be summoned before the learned executing Court.
11.
 In such terms this writ petition is accepted accordingly.

 AAMER FAROOQ J.---
 The petitioner filed a Suit for Declaration and Permanent Injunction challenging the price fixed by the respondents at the time of registration of the Drug 'Sofvasc-HCT Tablets' manufactured by the petitioner on the ground that the respondents not have the authority to do so and the price fixed was discriminatory, illegal and inconsistent with the provisions of Drugs Act, 1976 and Drugs Regulatory Authority of Pakistan Act, 2012. Along with the Suit, an application for interim relief was filed under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. The respondents filed reply to the referred application. The said application for interim relief was dismissed vide order dated 07.11.2016 on the ground that jurisdiction of the Civil Court is barred. The petitioner assailed the order before District Judge, Islamabad by way of an appeal which was dismissed vide order dated 11.02.2017.
2.
 Learned counsel for the petitioner, inter alia, contended that the courts have interpreted the provision regarding the bar of jurisdiction strictly and do exercise jurisdiction. It was further contended that the Civil Court do have the jurisdiction in such like cases and in the instant the Court had the jurisdiction inasmuch as the issue of price fixation does not fall within the domain of the Authority and it has exercised the same illegally, which can be examined by the Court of plenary jurisdiction. Reliance was placed on cases reported as 'Mian Muhammad Latif v. Province of West Pakistan through the Deputy Commissioner, Khairpur and another' (PLD 1970 Supreme Court 180), `Hamid Husain v. Government of West Pakistan and others (1974 SCMR 356), 'Province of the Punjab through Collector District Khushab, Jauharabad and others v. Haji Yaqoob Khan and others' (2007 SCMR 554), `Begum Syeda Azra Masood v. Begum Noshaba Moeen and others' (2007 SCMR 914), 'M/s Getz Pharma (Pvt.) Ltd. through Authorized Person v. Province of Sindh through Chief Secretary, Government of Sindh and 7 others' (PLD 2016 Sindh 479), `Liaqat National Hospital Association through Chairman, Governing Body and another v. Province of Sindh through Chief Secretary and 5 others' (PLD 2002 Karachi 359) and `Shahida Bibi and others v. Habib Bank Limited and others' (PLD 2016 Supreme Court 995).
3.
 Learned counsel for the respondents, inter alia, contended that jurisdiction of the Civil Courts is barred under section 39 of the Drug Act, 1976 therefore the orders passed by the courts below are in accordance with law.
4.
 The petitioner filed a Suit for Declaration and Permanent Injunction which was resisted by the respondents on the ground that same is barred under section 39 of the Drugs Act, 1976. For the ease of convenience, relevant provision of law is reproduced below:--
""39.
 
Finality of orders, etc.--
 Save as otherwise expressly provided in this Act, every order passed or decision given by any Board, a Drug Court or any other authority under this Act shall be final and shall not be called in question by or before any Court or other authority.""
The bare reading of above Section shows that any order passed or decision given by any Board is final and not to be called in question by or before any court or other authority.
5.
 The Courts of Pakistan have interpreted such provisions strictly in a way not to oust the jurisdiction of the courts. In a case reported as 'Mian Muhammad Latif v. Province of West Pakistan through the Deputy Commissioner, Khairpur and another' (PLD 1970 Supreme Court 180), it was observed as follows:-
""There is no doubt that under section 11 of the Sindh Revenue Jurisdiction Act, 1876, ordinarily a party in revenue matters should exhaust all his remedies by way of appeal before invoking the aid of the civil Court. But there are different considerations where the allegation of a party is that the impugned order is a nullity in the eye of law. The civil courts have jurisdiction to examine into cases where statutory provisions have not been complied with or the statutory tribunal has not acted in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial procedure""
Similarly, in case reported as `Hamid Husain v. Government of West Pakistan and others' (1974 SCMR 356), it was observed as follows:-
""Jurisdiction of civil Courts even if bared and conferred upon special tribunals, civil courts being Courts of ultimate jurisdiction have jurisdiction to examine acts of such forums to see if such are in accordance with law, or illegal, or even mala fide.""
In a case reported as 'Province of the Punjab through Collector District Khushab, Jauharabad and others v. Haji Yaqoob Khan and others' (2007 SCMR 554). it was held as under:-
""It is pertinent to mention here that different statutes provide that an order made by the authority acting under it shall not be called in question in any Court. The intentions of the Legislature in their wisdom qua section 36 of Colonization of Government Lands (Punjab) Act, 1912 are that the officers working under the Act should exercise their powers freely and should not be interrupted unnecessarily to administer colony land according to the terms and conditions issued by the competent authority off and on but this provision does not give unfettered power. The ambit of jurisdiction has been prescribed by the Act and the officers functioning there under cannot be allowed to act beyond their scope of jurisdiction. The Civil Court while exercising supervisory jurisdiction has the authority to interfere, if the orders are without jurisdiction, mala fide, excessive or otherwise not in accordance with law or based on fraud. This proposition of law was considered by the Privy Council in Secretary of State v. Mask and Company AIR 1940 PC 105 and laid down the following principles:---
""The exclusion of jurisdiction of the Civil Courts is not to be readily inferred but that such exclusion must either be explicitly expressed or clearly implied. It is also well-settled that even if jurisdiction is so excluded, the Civil Courts have jurisdiction to examine into cases where the provisions of the Act have not been complied, or the statutory Tribunal has not acted in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial procedure.""
The aforesaid proposition of law was considered by this Court in Zafarul Ahsan's case (supra) and laid down following principles:---
""Of course where the proceedings are taken mala fide and the statute is used merely as a cloak to cover an act which in fact is not taken though it purports to have been taken under the statute, the order will not, in accordance with a long line of decisions in England and in this sub-continent, be treated as an order under the statute.""
There are several pronouncements of the superior Courts that Civil Court in spite of the exclusive power has jurisdiction to take the cognizance of the matter in case the authorities under the Special Law have passed the order in violation of Rules and Regulations or mala fide. It is also settled law that manner of exercising power is also termed as mala fide as law laid down by this Court in Agha Shorash Kashmiri's case PLD 1969 SC 14. The aforesaid proposition of law with regard to the jurisdiction of the Civil Court is supported by following judgments:--
(1) Khadim Hussain's case PLD 1967 Lah. 915, (2) Muhammad Amin's case 1998 MLD 413, (3) Jewana's case PLD 1954 Lah. 253, (4) Karam Dad's case PLD 1978 Lah. 679, (5) Muhammad Saleh's case 1980 CLC 662, (6) Muhammad Ibrahim's case PLD 1960 Lah. 1106, (7) Masood Ali's case PLD 1950 Lah. 340, (8) Anjuman-e-Taleem-ul-Islam's case PLD 1983 Lah. 294, (9) Hamayun's case 1997 MLD 2669, (10) Muhammad Akram's case PLD 1993 Lah. 114, (11) Nawab Din's case 2003 CLC 1922, (12) Fateh Muhammad's case 2002 CLC 639, (13) Muhammad Zafar's case 2003 CLC 1922, (14) Muhammad Saleh's case 1980 CLC 662 (15); Khadim Hussain's case 1970 SCMR 127 and (16) Muhammad Shafi's case 1982 CLC 55.
The ratio of the aforesaid judgments is that section 36 of the Colonization of Government Lands (Punjab) Act, 1912 is available only where the authorities concerned acted within powers and four corners of their jurisdiction and not their acts are ultra vires or without jurisdiction or void or in excess of their jurisdiction""
In a case reported as 'Begum Syeda Azra Masood v. Begum Noshaba Moeen and others' (2007 SCMR 914), the august Apex Court reiterated the earlier case law and observed as follows:
""The law is clearly settled that an ouster clause in any statute will only apply when the authorities constituted therein act within the four corners of the statute and if they step out of it, the protection available to the orders passed by a Tribunal of special jurisdiction is no more available and Court of plenary jurisdiction could examine the controversy""
The Hon'ble Sindh High Court also followed the referred principle in a case reported as ""M/s Getz Pharma (Pvt.) Ltd. through Authorized Person v. Province of Sindh through Chief Secretary, Government of Sindh and 7 others' (PLD 2016 Sindh 479).
6.
 In view of above case law, the ousting of jurisdiction as provided in Section 39 of Drug Act, 1976 shall operate only if the Board or Drug Courts have acted in accordance with four corners of law. In case, there is any illegality or jurisdictional defect in exercise of authority, the same can be examined by civil courts being the court of plenary jurisdiction and the ouster clause would not be an impediment in exercise of jurisdiction by the civil courts.
7.
 There is no cavil that under section 56(d) of Specific Relief Act, 1877, no injunction can be granted against exercise of authority by a public functionary. However, if the public functionary acts illegally or mala fide, the referred exclusion shall not be applicable. Reliance is placed on a case reported as Liaqat National Hospital Association through Chairman, Governing Body and another v. Province of Sindh through Chief Secretary and 5-others' (PLD 2002 Karachi 359).
8.
 The learned trial court as well as first appellate court, while dismissing the application and the appeal, have erred in holding that the civil courts do not have the jurisdiction in light of Section 39 of the Drugs Act, 1976. The conclusion reached by the courts below is without examining the fact that whether the respondents have exercised their authority in accordance with law or have acted with mala fide. The jurisdiction, hence exercised by the courts below, is with material irregularity hence the impugned orders are not tenable.
9.
 In view of above, instant Civil Revision is allowed and the orders dated 11.02.2017 and 07.11.2016 are set aside. Consequently, the application for interim relief, filed by the petitioner, shall be deemed to be pending before learned trial court and shall be decided on merits in accordance with law.

 MOHAMMAD SHERAZ KIANI, J.--
The captioned writ petition has been filed under section 44 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act, 1974 whereby the petitioners have implored the following relief:--
""It is therefore humbly prayed that the writ petition may kindly be accepted and appropriate writ in favour of petitioner against the respondents may kindly be issued whereby, the order passed by the respondent No.1 dated 30.07.2013 may kindly be set aside. Consequently, the earlier orders passed by respondent No.1 dated 15.03.2013 and 10.08.2011 may also be quashed and the allotment of land bearing khasra Nos.414, 417, 420, 128 measuring 23 kanals 2 marlas situated at village Serri Tehsil and District Muzaffarabad may kindly be restored. Any other relief for which the petitioner be deemed entitled may also be granted in the interest of justice.""
2.
 The precise facts, leading to filing of the instant writ petition are that petitioner, being refugee of 1947 and entitled to 64 kanals land, the land was allotted in village Samahni and Malote tehsil and District Mirpur, as per his entitlement, however the land situated in village Malote Tehsil and District Mirpur, measuring 24 kanals 16 marlas was cancelled from the name of the petitioner, herein, on his request vide order dated 10.08.2011 on the ground that the same was barren and un-cultivable, with the condition that the petitioner will not be entitled to further allotment. It has been stated that thereafter, the petitioner according to his scale, got allotment chit dated 16.11.2011 pertaining to land bearing survey Nos.414, 417, 40, 128 situated in village Serri Tehsil and District Muzaffarabad after due process of law. It has been claimed that the petitioner applied for PRTO, however, the learned Custodian, vide order dated 15.03.2013 cancelled the allotment of the petitioner. The petitioner challenged the above order through a review petition before the Custodian which has also been dismissed through impugned judgment dated 30.07.2013, hence, the above titled writ petition before this Court.
3.
 The respondents were directed to file comments and later on, written statement but they did not appear before the Court, therefore, were proceeded ex-parte vide order dated 24.01.2014, however, upon the application of the respondents vide order dated 11.11.2015, the ex-parte order was recalled by this Court but respondents could not succeed to file written statement.
4.
 Mr. Muhammad Yaqoob Khan Mughal, Advocate the learned counsel for the petitioner, inter-alia, reiterated the facts incorporated in the petition and contended that the petitioner is refugee of 1947, hence, was entitled to the land as per the scale, up to 64 kanals and the same was allotted in his favour, however, the land measuring 24 kanals 16 marlas, situated in village Malote Tehsil and District Mirpur, being barren and unapproachable, was cancelled from the name of the petitioner, on his request vide order dated 10.08.2011 and the petitioner, being entitled to the Evacuee land as per scale, obtained allotment chit for another land bearing survey Nos.414, 417, 40, 128 situated in village Serri Tehsil and District Muzaffarabad on 16.11.2016 and made an application before the Custodian for Proprietary Rights Transfer Order, however, the learned Custodian, vide judgment dated 15.03.2013 cancelled the allotment chit, issued in favour of the petitioner on 16.11.2011. The learned counsel contended that the said judgment is a nullity in the eye of law on the ground that the case of the petitioner does not fall within the definition of the conditions, laid down in Section 18(B) of the Administration of Evacuee Property Act, which empowers the Custodian for cancellation of the allotment. The learned counsel stressed the point that the petitioner, being a refugee of 1947 is entitled to 64 kanals land and he has never abandoned his right of allotment, as has been observed by the learned Custodian and the application of the petitioner does not contain any such condition, however, in the statement the same has been incorporated, inadvertently by the officials of the Custodian, which the petitioner cannot be penalized for.
5. Mr. Muhammad Ilyas Abbasi, Advocate, the learned counsel for the petitioner, adopted the arguments of Mr. Muhammad Yaqoob Khan Mughal and added that the conditions, which have been enumerated in section 18(B) of the Administration of Evacuee Property Act, 1957 cannot be imposed upon the case of the petitioner and the learned Custodian has travelled beyond his jurisdiction, while passing the impugned order, he could have refused to grant the PRTO but cancellation of the allotment was not within his powers, therefore by accepting the instant writ petition, the judgment passed in review petition dated 30.07.2013 and the orders dated 15.03.2013 and 10.08.2011 be quashed and the petitioner be declared entitled to the evacuee land as per the prescribed scale.
6. On the contrary, the learned legal Advisor, appearing on behalf of the respondents, controverted the stance of the petitioner and contended that the petitioner was allotted land in District Mirpur in 1998 and the petitioner remained slept over his own cause for a period of about 13 years and thereafter, when, a valuable land was traced by him, he got cancelled the already allotted land just to take monetary benefits . The learned counsel claimed that the petitioner is estopped from filing the instant writ petition, due to his conduct . The learned counsel stressed the point that the order dated 15.03.2013 has been passed on the basis of order dated 10.08.2011 and the said order has not been challenged by the petitioner, before any proper forum, hence, has attained finality, whereas, the order dated 15.03.2013 has been passed in compliance of the said order, therefore, when the basic order has attained finality, the process in furtherance, thereof, cannot be termed as illegal. The learned counsel submitted that the order dated 10.08.2011 was passed on the request and statement of the petitioner, wherein, he has abandoned his right of further allotment, however, the petitioner, with the connivance of the concerned staff, managed to obtain allotment chit of the land situated in village Serri Tehsil and District Muzaffarabad,. however, when the matter of PRTO came before the learned Custodian, the Custodian, after due inquiry into the matter cancelled the allotment chit, issued in favour of the petitioner, under section 18(B) of the Administration of Evacuee Property Act, 1957. No illegality or irregularity has been committed by the respondents and the instant writ petition has been filed by the petitioner in order to protect the ill-gotten gains and the petitioner does not deserve any relief from this Court.
7.
 I have heard the learned counsel for the parties, gone through the record and given due thought to the controversy involved, therein.
8.
 At the very outset of the case, this Court would like to observe that the Custodian is a special tribunal of exclusive jurisdiction, findings of which cannot be nullified in exercise of writ jurisdiction, until and unless some glare departure from any settled law or its violation is established or the same is passed without jurisdiction , whereas, no such violation of law has been pointed out by the petitioners in the case in hand.
9.
 A perusal of the file reveals that except the judgment dated 30.07.02013, the other documents are unattested Photostat copies, hence, the instant writ petition has not been filed, by fulfilling the requirement of rule 32(2) of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir High Court Procedure Rules, 1984. For convenience, relevant rule is reproduced, which reads as follows:--
""32(1)
 An application under Section 44 of the Constitution for a direction, order or writ in the nature of mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, quo warranto etc, other than a writ in the nature of habeas corpus shall be filed before the Deputy Registrar.
(2) The application shall set out the name and description of the applicant, the exact nature of the relief sought and the ground on which it is sought, and shall be accompanied by an affidavit verifying the facts relied on, a certified copy of the impugned order and at least two copies thereof including annexure if any in addition to separate copy for each one of the respondents. The annexure accompanying the petition shall be marked numerically in red ink by the petitioner and the petition shall be properly indexed"".
10. However, in order to avoid technicalities and give decision on merits, I have perused the file with due care and found that the main stress of the petitioner is that the Custodian was not competent to cancel his allotment because the case of the petitioner does not come within the purview of the conditions laid down in section 18(B) of the Administration of Evacuee Property Act, 1957. To elaborate the legal position, relevant provision of law is reproduced, as under:--
""18(B) 1
. Notwithstanding anything contained contrary in any other law, for the time being in force, and without prejudice to the generality of the powers which already vest in him, the Custodian may cancel any allotment of evacuee property in the following cases:-
(a) Where an allottee has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of allotment within the meaning of Section 18 of the Act,
(b) Where an allottee has; to the satisfaction of the Custodian, voluntarily surrendered or abandoned the allotment;
(c) Where the allotment has been made in violation of law or is without jurisdiction;
(d) Where the evacuee property stands allotted to more than one person and it is necessary to determine the entitlement to allotment;
(e) Where an allotment is in excess of the prescribed scale and it is necessary to bring the allotment within scale in order to confer proprietary rights in accordance with law, upon such allottee. The Custodian shall exercise the powers of Multiple Judge under the Multiple Allotment Act, 1961, in cases processed or being processed for the grant of proprietary rights.
11. As the petitioner had abandoned his right of allotment, while recording his statement, during the proceedings of cancellation of the earlier allotment and the order dated 10.08.2011 was not challenged by the petitioner , well in time and he remained slept over his own case for a pretty long period and contrary to the said order, he managed to obtain further allotment and also applied for PRTO, however, on inquiry the learned Custodian took cognizance of the matter and cancelled his allotment, declaring the same as illegal and derogatory to the order dated 10.08.2011 , relevant content of the order is reproduced, hereunder:
12.
 The above order is still intact, which categorically forbids any further allotment to the petitioner. Previously, according to the prescribed scale, the land measuring 64 kanals was allotted in favour of the petitioner and thereafter, with his own free consent and willingness he got cancelled the allotment of the land to the extent of 24 kanals 16 marlas. He recorded his statement before the Custodian on 10.08.2011 and stated that in lieu of the cancelled land, no other allotment shall be made in his favour and the order of the Custodian dated 10.08.2011 clearly speaks that the petitioner will not be entitled to any further allotment. In presence of that order, the subsequent allotment from khasra Nos. 414, 417, 420, 128 measuring 23 kanals 2 marlas situated at village Serri Tehsil and District Muzaffarabad, in his name was contrary to the order dated 10.08.2011 and the same was allotted without lawful authority. In such situation, section 18(B)1(c) of the Act confers vast powers upon the Custodian, where the allotment is made in violation of any law or without jurisdiction, the Custodian is quite competent to cancel the same, so, the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the impugned order has been passed without jurisdiction is misconceived.
13. It has also been noticed that the petitioner got allotment of land situated in village Malote Tehsil and District Mirpur in 1998 and kept mum for a period of more than 13 years and when he succeeded to trace out some more valuable piece of land, he opted to get cancelled the said land and also succeeded to obtain allotment of another piece of land, apparently out of sheer greed. If the previous allotted land was not useful, why he did not refuse or got it cancelled that time, immediately. If such practice is allowed, then every allottee would like to get costly lands by adopting such methods for commercial reasons, which is not the intent and object of law. The story of allotment reveals that the petitioner has not come with clean hands rather seeks the protection of ill-gotten gains, that too, contrary to a Court order, in such circumstances, the writ cannot be issued in his favour.
14.
 A scrutiny of the file also reveals that the petitioner, though has prayed for vacation of order dated 10.08.2011 in the prayer clause of the petition, however, has not appended the said order with the petition.
15.
 As far the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner never abandoned his right of allotment and there is no mention of the same in the application filed on behalf of the petitioner is concerned, in this regard, it may be observed that the petitioner, has not appended the application, relied upon by him with the petition and has also not challenged the order dated 10.08.2011, properly. As the presumption of correctness is attached with the official/ judicial orders in absence of any proof, his assertion cannot be believed, therefore, it cannot be said that he had not abandoned his right of allotment, especially, when the order dated 10.08.2011 has attained finality.
16.
 For my own satisfaction, I have gone through the judgment under challenge, critically and have found that the same is based on sound reason, comprehensive enough one and a self speaking judgment, which a judicial order should be, and no illegality or departure from any law has been found, therefore, I am of the considered view that the judgment under challenge does not warrant any interference by this Court.
17.
 The sequel of the above discussion is that the instant writ petition being without any substance, is hereby dismissed.

 MOHAMMAD IBRAHIM KHAN, J.---
 A group of as many 10 Junior Lecturers of the Government College of Technology, Timergara Dir Lower, are imploring the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court for a prayer set in:
""Under circumstances mentioned above, it is therefore, respectfully prayed that, appropriate writs may be issued to the Respondents granting the following reliefs to the Petitioners:-
A.
 That the NWFP Regularization of Service Act, 2009 may be declared voilative of Article 26 (1) and void under Article 8 (1) and (2) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973.
B.
 That impugned order bearing No. TEVTA/HR-1/20/27 (79)/755 dated 29.02.2016 rejecting applications of the Petitioners for regularization of their services may be declared without jurisdiction, without lawful authority and of no legal effect.
C.
 That the Respondents may be directed to refrain from making discrimination with the Petitioners in the matter of their services and the right to the regularization from contract to regular basis an well.
D.
 It may be further directed to Respondents to regularize the Petitioners in their services, who were appointed on contract basis and costs of litigation may also be awarded.
2.
 These Petitioners are qualified and stated to have been appointed in the prescribed manner as Junior Lecturers on contract basis in Government College of Technology, Timergarah, Dir Lower by an order of the Director General Technical Education and Manpower Training Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar. Initially they have been appointment on contract and later on their service contracts were extended from time to time. They are still performing their duties with utmost zeal and to the best of their abilities. It is by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Employees (Regularization of Services) Act, 2009 whereby section 3 is discriminatory with regard to the regularization of these employees, which reads as under:-
""All employees including recommenders of the High Court, appointed on contract or Ad hoc basis and holding that post on 31st December, 2008 or till the commencement of this act, shall be deemed to have been validly appointed on regular basis having the same qualification and experience for a regular post.""
3.
 As and when this Act was passed the Government became reluctant in regularization of the services of these employees and are remained under contract. That previously identical writ petition has been decided on 11.12.2014 bearing Nos. 2374/2014, when on the same line the Petitioners be also regularized to meet the ends of justice.
4.
 Previously the Petitioners brought Writ Petition No.153-M of 2016 with a view to obtain directive to decide grievance applications but during the pendency of the said writ petition, the Respondents passed the impugned orders declining regularization to the Petitioners, thereby writ petition was allowed withdrawn and this petition having been presented also impugned the orders have now been challenged. Having set their grounds in the writ petition are to be given their respective reliefs for regularization of their services.
5.
 On calling the comments from the Respondents jointly submitted the defence line, which speaks off that the Petitioners appointment was on the basis of daily wages from student fund for some months each year when the college academic session is on and the Petitioners were engaged out of Student Fund on fixed pay. It was further transmitted through comments that only those government employees were drawing their salaries out of Government allocated budget through the concerned District Account Offices. The District Account Officers allotted the personal numbers. Whereas the Petitioners were purely engaged on fixed pay for academic session out of students fund. Hence prayer was made that because of this reason their regularization in service cannot be awarded.
6.
 Having heard arguments of learned counsel for the Petitioners and learned A.A.G for the Official Respondents, record with their valuable assistance gone through.
7.
 Learned counsel for the Petitioners relied on 2014 PLC (C.S.) 609 (Islamabad High Court) Miss Zakia Naurin and others v. Federation of Pakistan and others"", unreported judgment of this Court rendered in W.P. No. 1648 of 2007 dated 24.9.2008 titled "" Mst. Naveeda Yousaf v. EDO and others"", 1997 SCMR 1101 ""Dr. Zafar Aziz Khan v. Dr. Shabnam Iqbal Niazi and another"", 2002 PLC (C.S.) 1625 (Lahore High Court)"" Muhammad Yaqoob v. The Secretary Local Government"" and 1997 SCMR 1043 ""Mustaq Ahmad Moral v. The Hon'ble Lahore High Court"" and prayed for the acceptance of the writ petition as Petitioners have every right like other government employees to be regularized on their respective posts. On the other hand, learned A.A.G referred to 2015 SCMR 1739 ""Lahore Development Authority v. Mst. Imrana Tiwana and others"" and prayed for utter dismissal of the present writ petition.
8.
 Although many fold arguments in view of the rights being extended to the Petitioners under the relevant Articles of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, the matter could be looked in, but there are strong reservations as similar W.P. No.1823-P of 2016 titled as ""Burhanullah v. The Government of K.P.K"" is there in the field. Para 5 of the said judgment is reproduced as under for ready reference:-

 Record is suggestive that Petitioners were hired purely on contract basis from the student fund, due to acute shortage of teaching staff in the years 2013 and 2014, by the Principals concerned. Learned counsel for Petitioners was directed to address the Court that under which law they are seeking protection as Regularization Act, 2005 nor Regularization Act No. IX 2009 are applicable to the case of Petitioners due to their date of appointments. Learned counsel for the Petitioners failed to convince the Court in this respect.""
9.
 This being the developed scenario, we are unable to accept the prayer of regularization of the Petitioners on the sole score that contractual period has been extended from time to time being paid from the students fund.
10.
 In view of the above, this petition has got no force, which is hereby dismissed.

 SALAHUDDIN PANHWAR, J.---
Through instant bail application, applicant is seeking post arrest bail in Crime No.57 of 2016 registered at Police Station Mehmood Abad under sections 324, 336, 504, 34, P.P.C.
2.
 Precisely, the relevant facts of the case are that the present applicant caused hatchet injury on the back and neck of PW Kelash with intention to commit murder, hence booked in present FIR. 
3.
 It is contended by learned counsel for the applicant that the applicant, being innocent, has been involved in this case falsely; there is delay of two days in lodging the FIR; co-accused Ghulam Mustafa has already been granted bail; injured has not sustained the injury on the vital part of the body; complainant and witnesses are related inter-se; as such according to him the present applicant is entitled for concession of bail on the point of further inquiry. 
4.
 Learned A.P.G. has opposed the bail on the ground that present applicant has caused hatchet blow to PW Kelash with intention to commit his murder and his case is distinguishable to that of co-accused Ghulam Mustafa. 
5.
 Heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the material available on record. 
6.
 Admittedly, the name of the present applicant appears in the FIR with specific role that he being armed with hatchet caused hatchet blow to PW Kelash with intention to commit his murder and that injury has been declared by the Medical Board as ""Itlaf-e-Salahiyat-e-Udw"" which is constituting an offence punishable under section 336, P.P.C. No doubt said injury to PW Kelash is caused on back of his chest below the neck and it may not be said to be vital part of his body but there could be made no denial to the fact that it has entailed impairment of the organs, which according to the opinion of the Medical Board may take years to improve, such fact could not be lost of sight. Here, it may be added that in bail matters innocence or guilt is not decided nor legally it is permissible to step forward to go into such details. In bail matters, normally the accused has to make out a case of further inquiry which too with reference to collected material and not necessarily on basis of defence plea. In that situation, it would be pre-mature to say that present applicant being innocent has been involved in this case falsely. It is true that co-accused Ghulam Mustafa has already been admitted to bail but his case is quite distinguishable to the present accused as he was attributed the role of causing ineffective firing at PW Kelash. No doubt there is delay of about two days in lodging the FIR but delay in FIR per se is no ground for grant of bail if otherwise accused appears to be linked with offence with which he is charged. There appear reasonable grounds to believe that the present applicant is guilty of the offence for which he is charged. 
 In view of the above discussion, prima facie no case of further inquiry is made out. Accordingly, the instant bail application being without merits is hereby dismissed.

 OMAR SIAL, J.---
This post-arrest bail application has been filed by the Applicant in Crime No.40/2013 registered under sections 302, 324, 337-H(2), 114, 147, 149, P.P.C. at Police Station Baberloi.
2.
 The facts of the incident as contained in the FIR are lengthy and as the FIR forms part of the record, the same are not being reproduced here for the sake of brevity.
3.
 I have heard the learned counsel for the Appellant as well as the complainant. I have also heard the learned DPG and examined the record available with the counsels' assistance. My observations are as follows:
i.
 It appears that on 12-12-2014, the Applicant had filed a post-arrest bail application in this court. This application was withdrawn by him on 31-3-2016 before the same was heard. The first issue that I would like to address is whether the Applicant can raise grounds in support of the current application that were available to him at the time when he withdrew the first bail application. The learned counsel for the complainant and the learned APG have argued that he can not. In support of the argument that the Applicant can not raise a ground that was available to him at the time the first bail application, the learned counsel for the complainant has relied on a judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Amir Masih v. The State reported at 2013 SCMR 1524. In this case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that if the first bail application is dismissed as withdrawn, then the second bail application will require fresh ground to be agitated.
ii.
 It would be convenient to reproduce the order of this court dated 31-3-2016. The court ordered as follows:
""Mr. Ghulam Hyder Daudpoto, advocate associate of Mr. A.R. Farooq Pirzada submits that he has filed a statement dated 30-3-2016 that under instructions he does not press instant bail application with permission to avail remedy before learned trial court. Consequently, instant bail application stands disposed of. However, applicant is at liberty to avail remedy under the law.""
iii.
 It is pertinent to mention that the above bail application was not dismissed as withdrawn but was allowed to be withdrawn simpliciter as the Applicant wanted to raise a fresh ground of statutory delay before the trial court. The application was not argued at all by the. Applicant's counsel. In fact, the statement by the counsel for the Applicant was filed a day prior to the hearing of the bail application. In Ali Hasan v. The State (2001 SCMR 1047), the Hon'ble Supreme Court had held that withdrawal of application stmpliciter does not mean that the sane was dealt with on merits or on the grounds pressed. The situation, however, would be different if the earlier bail application was decided on merits and in such case while deciding the subsequent bail application, the ground which was not urged, although the same was available, would not constitute a fresh ground.
The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Nazir Ahmed v. The State (PLD 2014 Supreme Court 241) has also held:
""Withdrawal simpliciter of an earlier application for bail before addressing or hearing of any argument on the merits of the case does not preclude filing of a subsequent application for the same relief before the same court and its decision by such court on the merits of the case. In all cases of withdrawal of such an application the court must faithfully record in its order as to whether withdrawal of the application had been requested and allowed after addressing and hearing of some or all the arguments on the merits of the case or withdrawal of the application had been requested and allowed before addressing and hearing of any argument on the merits of the case.
iv.
 In view of the above judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court coupled with the fact that the court record shows that the bail application was withdrawn prior to being heard or argued at any length, I am of the humble view that the Applicant is entitled in this application to raise the grounds that were available to him at the time he filed the first application.
v.
 I would however like to observe that I am disappointed that the current bail application does not reveal that a previous bail application was filed in this court. In fact, the application states to the contrary. It was left to this court to discover the history of this case.
vi.
 The learned counsel has argued two grounds in support of the bail application. One, that only general allegations have been raised. Two, that the Applicant should be admitted to bail on ground of statutory delay.
vii.
 As regards the first ground raised viz that of general allegations, it is true that the complainant has implicated all the six accused of firing upon the deceased. Deceased Irshad was hit by four bullets whereas deceased Ashfaq Ahmed was hit by five bullets Prima facie, it can not be ruled out at this stage that the bullets fired by all the assailants hit the deceased.
viii.
 As regards the second ground argued i.e. that of statutory delay, the case diaries examined by me reveal that the accused and the complainant party are both responsible for the delay. The accused have kept changing counsel or one or the other defence counsel has remained absent. Similarly several adjournments were granted on account of strikes and other factors. The liability of the delay can not be put exclusively on the prosecution.
4.
 In view of the above, the Applicant has made out no ground for the grant of bail. Accordingly, the application is dismissed.

 MOHAMMED KARIM KHAN AGHA, J.---
Initially the accused/Respondent Asadullah son of Ghulam Farooq (the Respondent) was convicted by the learned Ist Judicial Magistrate, Karachi East vide judgment dated 25.02.2012 in respect of offenses under section 489-F, 448, 506(B), P.P.C. Thereafter, the accused/Respondent preferred Criminal Appeal No.7/2012 against the aforesaid judgment before the learned Sessions Judge, Karachi East, who after hearing the parties had allowed the appeal and the conviction and sentence recorded against the Respondent was set aside and he was acquitted from the charge by Judgment dated 19-09-2013 (the impugned judgment) by extending the benefit of the doubt.
2.
 The appellant Noor Ahmed son of Haji Khair Muhammed being dissatisfied with the impugned judgment has challenged the same through this instant appeal against acquittal.
3.
 The brief facts of the prosecution case as per contents of the FIR are that there were business terms between the Respondent and the appellant and they were running business in the name of Zamzama Hotel and Zamzama Bakery and had also purchased certain properties jointly being partners. The Respondent was tenant in respect of his shop No.1 situated on Plot No.N-3685, Metrovil Block-III, Scheme No.33 and was under obligation to have paid an amount of Rs.2,34,000/- out of which Rs.40,000/- have been paid by him but remaining amount of Rs.2,32,000/- has not been paid and on demand he used to abuse the appellant with filthy language and in pursuance of the said rent the Respondent issued cheques which were bounced. The Respondent was not paying the electricity bills, therefore, he was served notice for his ejection but he also occupied the adjacent shop owned by the appellant. The Respondent also collected money for publishing of Tafseer Quran, which was taken by the Respondent on the pretext of payment of certain profit but he failed to fulfill his commitment to the appellant hence the appellant lodged the aforesaid FIR against him under sections 489(F), 448, 506(B), P.P.C.
4.
 The appellant in this appeal against acquittal has mainly contended that the trial Court has acquitted the Respondent/accused without appreciating the evidence in accordance with the settled principles of law and that there has been a misreading and non-reading of evidence which requires the impugned judgment to be set aside by this court. On the other hand the Respondent has submitted that the impugned judgment is in accordance with law and that there are no legal infirmities which justify it being interfered with. Learned counsel for the State supported the arguments of the Respondent.
5.
 I have heard learned counsel for the appellant, Respondent Addl. Prosecutor General, examined the entire evidence available on record and the impugned judgment with the able assistance of learned counsel for the parties and have considered the relevant case law.
6.
 It appears that the trial Court through the impugned judgment has mainly acquitted the respondent for the following reasons as set out in the impugned judgment below;
Now the point remains only for consideration of bounce of alleged cheque passed on to the complainant by the appellant. The complainant Noor Ahmed in his statement before the trial Court has not disputed about the partnership in between complainant and appellant and running of joint business as well as purchase of property jointly. The said admission of the complainant in his statement before the learned trial Court is of much significance and relevant to the present case as such it has been borne out from the record that there was partnership and business transaction between them and P.W. Noor Ahmed in his statement has, candidly admitted to have received Rs.40,000/- from the appellant. He has also admitted that accused had given two cheques amounting to Rs.13,000/- and Rs.16,000/- and in his last line of the examination in chief he has also admitted that accused had returned an amount of Rs.40,000/-. He has also admitted the partnership in P.C.O. namely Noor Customer and Zam Zam Bakery and Zam Zam Hotel which is of very important nature under the circumstances of the case.
He has also admitted to have purchased two shops from his previous owner Muhammad Iqbal Soomro and the appellant have paid half payment of Rs.33,40,000/- to the seller in respect of two shops. He further admitted in cross-examination that accused had given him 3 cheques and has paid an amount of Rs.11,000/- to him and he had returned the said bounced cheque of Rs.11,000/- to him. He has further admitted in cross-examination that the total amount of 3 cheques comes to Rs.40,000/- and that the said amount of Rs.40,000/- has been paid to him by the accused as per first part of his examination-in-chief. He further admitted in cross examination that he has not served any letter on the appellant for return of the loan amount nor filed suit for recovery of the said amount. He further admitted in cross-examination that he lodged the FIR after quarrel took place in between him and accused in respect of the property which admission also shows that the dispute arose in between them on the point of certain properties owned by both of them. The statement of the complainant is therefore full of discrepancies which shows that there was rivalry in between him and accused because of dispute over the properties which they had purchased during the course of partnership business. Admittedly the complainant Noor Ahmed charged the appellant regarding dishonor of two cheques amounting to Rs.13,000/- and Rs.16,000/- and third cheque of Rs.11,000/- according to him he had returned to the appellant on receipt of cash of Rs.11,000/-. The aggregate amount of all these cheques comes to Rs.40,000/- which he had already received as per his evidence as discussed above, as such registration of FIR is very meaningful and seems to have been registered for some ulterior motive. The witness examined by the complainant has also admitted the payment of aggregage amount of Rs.40,000/- by D.W. Ali Ahmed to Muhammad Siddiq son of complainant and P.W. Muhammad Siddiq has also been examined by the complainant and he also admitted to have received Rs.40,000/- from the appellant. The appellant in his statement on oath has also well worded about payment of Rs.40,000/- against said 3 cheques by deposing that he had given 3 cheques to the tenant of the complainant for handing over the same to the complainant and also informed him that he had no money his account and had also requested him not to present the cheque in bank and later on he had given cheque amount of Rs.40,000/- to Ali Ahmed and complainant received the said amount. The same assertion has been made by him on statement on oath which has not been controverted in cross-examination. He has also examined D.W.2 Ali Ahmed who has also made the similar assertion regarding payment made to the complainant by the appellant.
D.W. Ali Ahmed has been cited by the prosecution as witness but he has not been examined by the prosecution and has been given up vide statement Ex.9 being formal witness and the appellant has examined him as D.W.2 who has not supported the case of the prosecution which also adversely reflects on the case of the prosecution. All the said evidence has not been considered in its true perspective by the learned trial Court while recording conviction and sentence against the appellant.
From the discussion of the evidence it has therefore emerged out that there was a partnership between the parties which culminated in dispute over transfer of the properties which has been admitted by the complainant Noor Ahmed in his statement, therefore, false implication of the appellant could not be ruled out specially when the complainant has admitted the receipt of proceed of alleged bounced cheque without any protest. Therefore, in my humble opinion the complainant has failed to establish his case beyond any reasonable doubt as such the findings of the learned trial Court could not be sustained. (bold added)
7.
 It is settled law that judgment of acquittal should not be interjected until findings are perverse, arbitrary, foolish, artificial speculative and ridiculous as held by the honourable Supreme Court in the case of The State v. Abdul Khaliq and others (PLD 2011 Supreme Court 554). Moreover, the scope of interference in appeal against acquittal is narrow and limited because in an acquittal the presumption of the innocence is significantly added to the cardinal rule of criminal jurisprudence as the accused shall be presumed to be innocent until proved guilty. In other words, the presumption of innocence is doubled as held by the honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in the above referred judgment. The relevant para is reproduced hereunder:-
""16. We have heard this case at a considerable length stretching on quite a number of dates, and with the able assistance of the learned counsel for the parties, have thoroughly scanned every material piece of evidence available on the record; an exercise primarily necessitated with reference to the conviction appeal, and also to ascertain if the conclusions of the Courts below are against the evidence on the record and/or in violation of the law. In any, event, before embarking upon scrutiny of the various pleas of law and fact raised from both the sides, it may be mentioned that both the learned counsel agreed that the criteria of interference in the judgment against acquittal is not the same, as against cases involving a conviction. In this behalf, it shall be relevant to mention that the following precedents provide a fair, settled and consistent view of the superior Courts about the rules which should be followed in such cases; the dicta are:
Bashir Ahmed v. Fida Hussain and 3 others (2010 SCMR 495), Noor Mali Khan v. Mir Shah Jehan and another (2005 PCr.LJ 352), Imtiaz Asad v. Zain-ul Abidin and another (2005 PCr.LJ 393), Rashid Ahmed v. Muhammad Nawaz and others (2006 SCMR 1152), Barkat Ali v. Shaukat Ali and others (2004 SCMR 249), Mulazim Hussain v. The State and another (2010 PCr.LJ 926), Muhammad Tasweer v. Hafiz Zulkarnain and 2 others (PLD 2009 SC 53), Farhat Azeem v. Asmat Ullah and 6 others (2008 SCMR 1285), Rehmat Shah and 2 others v. Amir Gul and 3 others (1995 SCMR 139), The State v. Muhammad Sharif and 3 others (1995 SCMR 635), Ayaz Ahmed and another v. Dr. Nazir Ahmed and another (2003 PCr.LJ 1935), Muhammad Aslam v. Muhammad Zafar and 2 others (PLD 1992 SC 1), Allah Bakhsh and another v. Ghulam Rasool and 4 others (1999 SCMR 223), Najaf Saleem v. Lady Dr. Tasneem and others (2004 YLR 407), Agha Wazir Abbas and others v. The State and others (2005 SCMR 1175), Mukhtar Ahmed v. The State (1994 SCMR 2311), Rahimullah Jan v. Kashif and another (PLD 2008 SC 298), 2004 SCMR 249, Khan v. Sajjad and 2 others (2004 SCMR 215), Shafique Ahmad v. Muhammad Ramzan and another (1995 SCMR 855), The State v. Abdul Ghaffar (1996 SCMR 678) and Mst. Saira Bibi v. Muhammad Asif and others (2009 SCMR 946).
From the ratio of all the above pronouncements and those cited by the learned counsel for the parties, it can be deduced that the scope of interference in appeal against acquittal is most narrow and limited, because in an acquittal the presumption of innocence is significantly added to the cardinal rule of criminal jurisprudence, that an accused shall be presumed to be innocent is doubled. The courts shall be very slow in interfering with such an acquittal judgment, unless it is shown to be perverse, passed in gross violation of law, suffering from the errors of grave misreading or non reading of the evidence; such judgments should not be lightly interfered and heavy burden lies on the prosecution to rebut the presumption of innocence which the accused has earned and attained on account of his acquittal. It has been categorically held in a plethora of judgments that interference in a judgment of acquittal is rare and the prosecution must show that there are glaring errors of law and fact committed by the Court in arriving at the decision, which would result into grave miscarriage of justice; the acquittal judgment is perfunctory or wholly artificial or a shocking conclusion has been drawn. Moreover, in number of dictums of this Court, it has been categorically laid down that such judgment should not be interjected until the findings are perverse, arbitrary, foolish, artificial, speculative and ridiculous (Emphasis supplied). The Court of appeal should not interfere simply for the reason that on the re-appraisal of the evidence a different conclusion could possibly be arrived at, the factual conclusions should not be upset, except when palpably perverse, suffering from serious and material factual infirmities. It is averred in The State v. Muhammad Sharif (1995 SCMR 635) and Muhammad Ijaz Ahmad v. Raja Fahim Afzal and 2 others (1998 SCMR 1281) that the Supreme Court being the final forum would be chary and hesitant to interfere in the findings of the Courts below. It is, therefore, expedient and imperative that the above criteria and the guidelines should be followed in deciding these appeals."" (bold and italics added)
8.
 Having gone through the evidence and the impugned judgment I find that there has been no misreading or non-reading of evidence, that the impugned judgment is based on sound reasons and there is no question of the findings in the impugned judgment being perverse arbitrary, foolish, artificial, speculative and ridiculous especially as it is a well established principle of law that the accused is always entitled to the benefit of the doubt in criminal cases and as was held in the case of Tariq Pervez v. The State (1995 SCMR 1345), where the honourable Supreme Court has observed as follows:-
""It is settled law that it is not necessary that there should be many circumstances creating doubts. If there is a single circumstance, which creates reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the guilt of the accused, then the accused will be entitled to the benefit not as a matter of grace and concession but as a matter of right.""
9.
 As such in my view there is no merit in the instant appeal against acquittal. The Acquittal recorded by trial Court in favour of Respondent is based upon sound reasons, which require no interference at all. As such, the instant appeal against acquittal is dismissed.
10.
 These are the reasons for my short order of even date.

 JAWAD HASSAN, J.---
 Through the instant Constitutional petition, filed under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the ""Constitution""), the Petitioner has impugned order dated 15.11.2016 (the ""Impugned Order"") passed by the Respondent No.1 whereby his representation has been dismissed and also sought a direction to the Respondents for issuance of his appointment letter.
2.
 The facts, tersely revealed from the petition, are that in the year 1995 the Petitioner obtained diploma of Medical Health Technician from the Punjab Health Department. The Respondents Department advertised 14 posts of Medical Health Technicians along with other vacancies for which the required qualification was F.Sc. Pre-Medical with diploma in Medical Health Technician and in pursuance of which the Petitioner and others applied for the said post but their applications were not entertained by the Respondent No.3 whereupon the Petitioner filed W.P. No.5843/2008 (the ""First Writ Petition"") and some other candidates also filed W.P. No.6629/2008 in which it was ordered for the entertainment of Petitioner's Application provisionally. On passing the judgment in W.P. No.1962/2006 by this Court, the Department re-advertised the posts of Medical Health Technician with the requisite qualification of Matric with Science along with diploma of Medical Health Technician. Feeling aggrieved by the age limit in the said re-advertisement the Petitioner and others filed C.M. No.2642/2011 in W.P. No.5843/2008 on the ground that due to constant ban on the recruitments and enhancement of qualification for the post of Medical Health Technician, was entertained provisionally as per order dated 01.06.2011. Thereafter, both the abovementioned writ petitions i.e. W.Ps. Nos.5843/2008 and 6629/2008 were disposed of with the direction to the Respondents to decide the applications of the Petitioner and others whereupon the Respondent No.3 issued appointment letter to the Respondent No.4 instead of issuing appointment letter to the Petitioner and the Petitioner's case was referred for further guidelines. Being dissatisfied from that, the Petitioner filed W.P. No.8027/2016 (the ""Second Writ Petition"") which was disposed of with the direction to the Respondent No.1 to decide the representation of the Petitioner but the same was decided on filing the Crl. Orgl. No.917-W/2016 by the Petitioner vide the impugned order dated 15.11.2016. Hence, this petition.
3.
 In pursuance of order of this Court dated 10.01.2017, the Respondents filed report and parawise comments denying all the allegations levelled in the petition and prayed for dismissal of the petition.
4.
 Learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the impugned order has been passed in contravention of the order passed by this Court in W.P. No.827/2016 dated 03.05.2016; that the Petitioner has been treated with discrimination as the Respondent No.4 has been issued appointment letter but the case of the Petitioner, which is at par with the case of Respondent No.4, has been forwarded for further guidelines; that while deciding the Application of the Petitioner, the Respondent Authority has ignored the issue of age limits as at the time of obtaining diploma he was eligible for the post but due to ban on recruitments, the Petitioner has become overage; that the Respondents have relaxed the upper age limit of other candidate but the Petitioner has been denied of the same; that the Petitioner has become overage due to the circumstances beyond his control, as such relaxation in upper age limited should have been granted to the Petitioner; that some posts of Medical Health Technician are vacant but the Department with ulterior motive is not appointing the Petitioner. In support of his contentions learned counsel has placed reliance on the case tilted Mst. Basharat Jehan v. Director-General Federal Government Education, FGEI (C/Q) Rawalpindi and others (2015 SCMR 1418) and Muhammad Shahab v. Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa through Secretary, Health, Peshawar and 2 others (2013 PLC (C.S.) 712).
5.
 On the other hand, learned counsel for the Respondents controverted the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the Petitioner and prayed for dismissal of the petition on the grounds that the Petitioner was over age, therefore, has been ousted from the recruitment process; that no discriminatory attitude has been adopted towards the Petitioner as the Respondent No.4, who has been issued appointment letter, was not overage rather under the age limit of 35 years.
6.
 I have heard the arguments of both the sides and perused the record minutely.
7.
 Basically, the Petitioner is aggrieved by the impugned order of the Respondent No.1 dated 15.11.2016 passed on the direction of this Court in W.P. No.8027/2016 vide order dated 30.05.2016. The said writ petition was disposed of with the direction to the Respondent No.1 to decide the representation of the Petitioner after affording him opportunity of hearing in accordance with law. The perusal of the impugned order reveals that the same has been passed in detail, containing all the contentions of the Petitioner and after providing full opportunity of hearing to the Petitioner. The Respondent No.1 while passing the impugned order has dismissed the representation of the Petitioner on the grounds that he challenged the amendment in Service Rules after five (5) years and mainly that he has become overage, reaching at the age of about 46 years, therefore, not eligible for the appointment of Medical Health Technician under the Law, Rules and Policies. The impugned order also mentioned that the case of the Petitioner is distinguishable from the case of one Khurshid Ahmed as after uplifting of ban EDO (H) Layyah advertised the post of Health Technician number of times, as such direction of the Ombudsman does not apply to the case of the Petitioner.
8.
 The perusal of report and parawise comments, filed on behalf of the Respondents, depicts that as per the Notification of Services and General Administration Department Lahore dated 06.10.2003, copy of which is attached with the comments, age of candidate should be 21 to 30 years and five (5) years relaxation so for 30 to 35 years but the Petitioner has crossed the limit by that time. Meaning thereby, the Petitioner was denied appointment on the basis of being overage in accordance with law. The Respondents Authority cannot be compelled to give undue favour in shape of relaxation of upper age limit of the Petitioner against their Rules and Regulations. In this regard reliance can be placed on the case titled Muhammad Nazir Khan v. Government of the Punjab (1997 CLC 354) wherein this Court held as under:
""Punjab Public Service Commission being statutory body owed its constitution to Punjab Public Service Commission Ordinance, 1978 and was required to perform its functions and regulate its procedure within ambit of law and rules framed thereunder. The Regulations and decisions meant for internal working must also conform to authority prescribed by law. All statutory bodies and functionaries were under obligation to act in accordance with law and relevant rules; any deviation from such law or rules would render their acts without lawful authority so as to attract power of judicial review.""
Moreover, the perusal of order dated 30.05.2016 passed by this Court in W.P. No.8027/2016 explicitly shows that a direction to the Respondents was issued to decide the representation of the Petitioner strictly in accordance with law, so, when the Petitioner has been rejected in pursuance of above referred Notification on the basis of overage, it cannot be said that the representation has been decided in contravention of the directions of this Court. The grounds taken by the Petitioner for relaxation of upper age limit cannot be considered to be a valid ground. Moreover, it is noticed that while deciding the Representation of the Petitioner, he has been afforded proper opportunity of personal hearing.
9.
 Furthermore, the contention of discrimination of the Petitioner also does not support him as the Petitioner was overage whereas Respondent No.4 was under the limit of age, as such the case of the Petitioner cannot be said to be at par with that of the Respondent No.4. The Petitioner has failed to establish from the record appended with the petition, any element of ulterior motive, as alleged by the Petitioner, on the part of the Respondents/Department while refusing the Petitioner's appointment, hence the impugned order cannot be held to be illegal to the extent of the Petitioner.
10.
 So far as the contention of the learned counsel for the Petitioner that some posts of Medical Health Technician are vacant and the Petitioner can be appointed/accommodated on one of the same is not instructive. It is a settled law that without adopting proper procedure under the law, not even a single post can be filled just to accommodate a person who is otherwise not eligible for the said post. In the case cited by the learned counsel for the Petitioner the appointment orders had been issued to the individual but in the present case the Petitioner has been denied appointment due to being overage, as such the case laws relied upon by the learned counsel for the Petitioner are distinguishable from the case in hand as each and every case has its own facts and circumstances, therefore, do not support him.
11.
 In view of above facts, circumstances and case law, there is no illegality in the impugned order to the extent of the Petitioner. When the Petitioner has become overage, therefore, the Department cannot be compelled to go beyond their Rules, Regulations and Policies and that too this Court cannot rescue any person for the enforcement of any right of which he is not entitled.
12.
 For what has been discussed above, the instant petition, being devoid of any force, is hereby dismissed.

 MIRZA VIQAS RAUF, J.---
By way of this single judgment we intend to decide the instant appeal as well as Crl. Appeal No.338 of 2015 and Crl. Appeal No.375 of 2015 as all these appeals are directed against the judgment dated 30th of July, 2015, passed by the learned Drug Court for Punjab, Rawalpindi Division, Rawalpindi.
2.
 The appellants namely Asim Yasin, Abdul Waris Bhatti and Mir Hassan were tried by the learned Drug Court in pursuance to a complaint lodged by the Provincial Inspector of Drugs, Potohar Town, Rawalpindi, for violation of sections 23(1)(a)(i), 23(1)(c) and 23(1)(i), punishable under section 27(1) & (4) of the Drugs Act, 1976.
3.
 The prosecution against the appellants was set into motion on the allegation that on 30th of November, 2011 the Provincial Inspector of Drugs, Rawalpindi, while on routine inspection got an information regarding sale of some drugs at a medical store by some unknown persons. On the basis of this information Muhammad Shoaib Akhtar Drug Inspector intercepted Asim Yasin (appellant) from in front of Messrs Farhan Medical Store and recovered two different allopathic drugs from his possession which were taken into possession through Form No.5 (seizure Memo) Exh.PA. Suspecting the said drugs to be spurious, samples were extracted for the purpose of test/ analysis vide Form No.4 Exh.PB and a request was routed to the District Quality Control Board (DQCB), Rawalpindi, for permission to lodge an FIR against the accused, which was accorded. In pursuance thereof on the application of Drug Inspector FIR No.27 of 2011 dated 30th of November, 2011 (Exh.PQ) was lodged at Police Station FIA Crime Circle, Rawalpindi. After registration of FIR Asim Yasin (appellant) was taken into custody by the FIA officials, who made disclosure about the chain of supply of spurious drugs and named his co-accused Abdul Waris Bhatti (appellant), who was then called through Asim Yasin to bring more spurious drugs and when he arrived at the given address along with consignment, he was arrested and from his possession a drug was taken into custody vide Form No.5 (Exh.PF). A sample was also extracted from the recovered drug for analysis through Form No.4 (Exh.PE). Abdul Waris Bhatti further made a disclosure and named Mir Hassan as his co-accused. Mir Hassan (appellant) was also called through Abdul Waris Bhatti (appellant) for supply of drugs at the specific place and when he arrived along with the consignment, he was also arrested and from his possession two drugs were taken into custody vide Form No.5 (Exh.PG). Samples from the said drugs were also extracted vide Form No.4 (Exh.PH). All these samples were thus sent to the Drug Testing Laboratory, Punjab, Lahore, (DTL) vide Form No.6 (Exh.PI/1-5) and on analysis the Government Analyst declared all the recovered drugs as spurious vide reports Exh.PZE, Exh.PZH, Exh.PZF, Exh.PZI, and Exh.PZG. Since the Drug Inspector namely Muhammad Shoaib Akhtar, who effected the recovery, in the meanwhile, was transferred and in his place Naveed Anwar took the charge. So after fulfillment of the codal formalities, he referred the matter to PQCB where the formal proceedings were conducted and after hearing the accused (appellants), permission for their prosecution was granted and consequently complaint Exh.PP was placed before the learned Drug Court. While taking cognizance of the offence the accused (appellants) were summoned by the learned Drug Court to face the trial. The learned Drug Court framed the charge against the appellants on 18th of December, 2012 to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
4.
 In order to prove the charge against the appellants the prosecution examined seven witnesses in toto and in addition thereto also tendered certain documents to bring home guilt of the accused (appellants). On closure of the prosecution evidence the respective statements of the accused (appellants) were recorded under Section 342, of The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (hereinafter referred as Cr.P.C.). All the accused pleaded their innocence and stated that false recovery has been foisted and planted upon them. The appellants however, neither lead any defence evidence nor appeared as their own witnesses in terms of section 340(2), Cr.P.C. On culmination of trial the learned Drug Court after holding the accused (appellants) guilty, convicted and sentenced them as under:--
""Accused Mir Hassan is convicted under section 27(1) of the Drugs Act, 1976 for commission of offence under section 23(1)(a)(ii) of the Act ibid and sentenced to ten(10) years R.I. with a fine of Rs.100,000/- (rupees one lakh). In default of payment of fine, the convict shall further undergo two years S.I. He is also convicted under section 27(4) of the Drugs Act, 1976 for selling drugs without having drug sale license and is sentenced to imprisonment of five (05) years R.I. and to pay fine of Rs.50,000/- (rupees fifty thousand) or in default he shall further undergo one year S.I. All the sentences shall run concurrently. Benefit of Section 382-B, Cr.P.C. shall also be extended to the convict.
""Accused Asim Yasin is convicted under section 27(1) of the Drugs Act, 1976 for commission of offence under section 23(1)(a)(ii) of the Act ibid and sentenced to ten(07) years R.I. with a fine of Rs.100,000/- (rupees one lakh). In default of payment of fine, the convict shall further undergo two years S.I. He is also convicted under section 27(4) of the Drugs Act, 1976 for selling drugs without having drug sale license and is sentenced to imprisonment of five (05) years R.I. and to pay fine of Rs.50,000/- (rupees fifty thousand) or in default he shall further undergo one year S.I. All the sentences shall run concurrently. Benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C. shall also be extended to the convict.
""Accused Abdul Waris Bhatti is convicted under section 27(1) of the Drugs Act, 1976 for commission of offence under section 23(1)(a)(ii) of the Act ibid and sentenced to ten(07) years R.I. with a fine of Rs.100,000/- (rupees one lakh). In default of payment of fine, the convict shall further undergo two years S.I. He is also convicted under section 27(4) of the Drugs Act, 1976 for selling drugs without having drug sale license and is sentenced to imprisonment of five (05) years R.I. and to pay fine of Rs.50,000/- (rupees fifty thousand) or in default he shall further undergo one year S.I. All the sentences shall run concurrently. Benefit of Section 382-B, Cr.P.C. shall also be extended to the convict.""
5.
 While opening the case of appellants Mr. Muhammad Abid Raja, Advocate, submitted that prosecution has badly failed to prove the charge against the appellants. He added that though no offence whatsoever is made out against the appellants but a guilty verdict has been recorded by the learned Drug Court in an illegal and unlawful manner. While referring to the statement of Muhammad Amin Bhatti (PW-2), learned counsel emphatically argued that as per prosecution's own case he was the star witness and despite discarding his statement the appellants were held guilty of the offence. Learned counsel added that prosecution evidence was not of trustworthy and there are multiple legal infirmities in the prosecution case. It is contended that conviction of the appellants in the circumstances cannot sustain.
6.
 Conversely, learned Assistant Attorney General while defending the impugned judgment emphasized that appellants were rightly convicted by the learned Drug Court and there is no illegality in the impugned judgment warranting into interference by this Court in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. The learned law officer submitted that the appellants have indulged themselves in the business of selling of spurious drugs and they do not deserve any leniency.
7.
 After having heard learned counsel for the appellants as well as learned law officer at considerable length we have also gone through the record.
8.
 As per initial complaint (Ex.PD) crafted by Muhammad Shoaib Akhtar Provincial Drug Inspector (PW-1), on 30th November, 2011, when he along with Muhammad Amin Bhatti, Naib Qasid (PW-2) was on routine checking in the area of Tahli Mori, Rawalpindi, reached in front of M/s Farhan Medical Store, he saw a person standing there with the intention to supply drugs and when he was interrogated on the basis of suspicion, he was unable to justify his presence there. On the basis of this suspicion from his possession two drugs VELOSEF CAP 500 MG, and NOVIDAT 500 MG TABLET were taken into possession which were later on found as spurious. The said person disclosed his name as Asim Yasin (appellant). The drugs recovered were taken into possession vide Form No.5 (Ex.PA). As per prosecution case accused Asim Yasin further disclosed the name of his co-accused namely Abdul Waris Bhatti (appellant), who was asked through Asim Yasin to supply more medicines and when he reached near G.P.O. Saddar, he was apprehended along with spurious drugs. The name of Mir Hassan accused (appellant) was unsurfaced by Abdul Waris Bhatti, who was also trapped near Bread and Butter Bakery, Saddar by the FIA officials in the same manner and from his possession certain spurious drugs were also taken into custody. After having a cursory glance of the gist of allegations and the nature of accusation against the appellants, we being mindful of the importance of the framing of charge against the accused (appellants), adverted ourselves to the charge framed by the learned Drug Court against the appellants. For the purpose of convenience the same is reproduced below:--
""That on 30.11.2011, at 2.30 pm, Provincial Drugs Inspector Rwp: observed a person (who declared his name) Asim Yasin son of Ghulam Yasin accused No.1 with the intention of selling or supplying of drugs/medicines opposite the above mentioned business premises and recovered capsule Velosef 500 mg Batch No.IF702 and Tablets Novidat 500 mg Batch No.22J (outer carton) and 5K on the strips upon information accused No.1 recovered/seized capsule Velosef 500 mg Batch No.IF 702 from the custody of Abdul Waris Bhatti son of Maqbool Bhatti, Accused No.2. Upon information of Accused No.2 recovered/ seized Tablet Tarivid 200 mg Batch No.WH 049 and Capsul Velosef 500mg Batch No.IF702 from the custody of Mir Hassan son of Syed Hassan, accused No.3. All the samples were sent for test/Analyses purpose to the Drug Testing Laboratory, Punjab, Lahore, who declared ""Them SPURIOUS"" Hence you all have committed the offence un-Warranted, Spurious, Without drug sale License under sections 23(1)(i), 23(1)(a)(i), 23(1)(c) of the Drugs Act, 1976, punishable under sections 27(1) & 27(4) of the said Act.
And hereby you contraved the provisions of section 23 of the Drugs Act, 1976 Punishable under section 27 of the said Act which is within the cognizance of this Court."" (Underlining for emphasis).
9.
 There is no cavil that charge is always treated as foundation of the trial and the legislature in Chapter XIX of Cr.P.C. has provided an elaborate procedure for framing of the charge, enabling the accused to know the exact nature of accusation made against him so that he could give a proper reply of the same. The object and rational for laying down an exhaustive and elaborate procedure for framing of charge is that the accused should know the exact nature of the accusations made against him so that he may not be misled if any vagueness in the said accusations. Charge is always expected to contain all material particulars including time, place and specific name of the alleged offence, the manner in which the offence is committed.
10.
 After having an analytical view of the charge framed against the appellants and the evidence lead in pursuance thereof by the prosecution, we have no doubt in our mind to observe that the appellant Asim Yasin was apprehended only on the basis of suspicion that he was intending to sell the drugs which are later on detected as spurious by the government analyst. Perusal of charge clearly reveals that all the appellants were put to trial on the same allegations. The appellants were undoubtedly have been punished under Section 27 of The Drugs Act, 1976, on account of offending the prohibition contained in Section 23 of the Act ibid. We are mindful of the fact that penalties provided under the said provisions can only be imposed on account of non-compliance of prohibition referred to under Section 23 of the said Act. For the purpose of ready reference and convenience Section 23 is reproduced below:-
""23. Import, manufacture and sale of drugs.---(1) No person shall himself or by any other person on his behalf:--
(a)
 export, import or manufacture for sale or sell:
(i)
 any spurious drug;
(ii)

(viii)

(ix)

(b)

(ii)

(1)
 apply an incorrect batch number to a drug.
(2)
 Nothing in subsection (1) shall apply to the manufacturer of subject to prescribed conditions, of small quantities of any drug for the purpose of clinical trial, examination, test, analysis or personal use.""
11.
 Bare perusal of the above referred provision envisages that prohibition in terms of Section 23 of the Drugs Act, 1976 is imposed upon a person only on the export, import or manufacture for sale or sell any spurious drug. It is prosecution's own case that the appellant namely Asim Yasin was implicated in the case on the basis that he was intending to sell spurious drugs. While taking the case of Asim Yasin appellant we have noticed that he was apprehended by the Drug Inspector in presence of Muhammad Amin Bhatti, (PW-2) only on the basis of suspicion that he was standing there with the intention to supply drugs. As already observed that an accused charged under the Drugs Act, 1976, can only be punished under Section 27 of the Act in case he violates the prohibition contained in Section 23 of the said Act. For invoking the prohibition mentioned in Section 23 of The Drugs Act, 1976, it was incumbent upon the prosecution to first set forth the charge of selling the spurious drugs by the accused and then to lead cogent evidence to this effect. Admittedly, Asim Yasin appellant was neither charged on the basis of selling nor it was the prosecution case that he was selling some spurious drugs. Mere having an intention of sale is not sufficient to saddle the accused with the culpability of offence.
12.
 There is yet another important aspect, the edifice of the prosecution case was solely structured upon the recovery allegedly effected from Asim Yasin appellant which was purportedly witnessed by Muhammad Amin Bhatti (PW-2). It is established on the record that the learned Drug Court has discarded the evidence of PW-2 from its consideration. Thus on account of lack of necessary ingredients for constituting an offence under Section 27 of The Drugs Act, 1976 and the deficient evidence to this effect, we are of the considered view that Asim Yasin (appellant) could not be held guilty of the offence for which he was charged.
13.
 So far case of accused Abdul Waris Bhatti and Mir Hassan appellants is concerned, both were implicated on the statement of their respective co-accused. Law is well settled that mere statement of the co-accused is not sufficient to saddle an accused with the culpability of the offence. There is no independent evidence available with the prosecution to prove that either of the accused namely Abdul Warris Bhatti or Mir Hassan had indulged in the offence of selling spurious drugs. The recovery memos. prepared with regard to the alleged recovery effected from these two appellants and samples extracted therefrom through Form No.4 and Form No.5 tendered in evidence as Ex.PE, Ex.PF, Ex.PG and Ex.PH respectively clearly substantiate that both these appellants were booked in the case with malafide intent and the Drug Inspector has clearly exceeded his jurisdiction. The manipulation with the said documents was even suppressed by the Abid Saeed Baig, Director Technical DHQ Hospital, Rawalpindi, when he appeared as PW-7. The prosecution case is not only suffers a lot of legal infirmities but is fraught with reasonable doubts, the benefit of which always leans in favour of the accused. There are dishonest improvements in the prosecution case which were certainly introduced with a prejudice mind so as to earn a guilty verdict for the appellants.
14.
 The above discussion leads us to an irresistible conclusion that the prosecution evidence was not worthy of credence and legal infirmities noted hereinabove are sufficient enough to discard the findings of guilt recorded by the learned Drug Court. We are thus of unanimous view that the appellants were convicted without properly appraising the evidence, thus the impugned judgment, holding the appellants guilty, cannot sustain in the circumstances. We, thus while extending the benefit of doubt to the appellants, allow these appeals and acquit the appellants from the charge. The appellants shall be released forthwith, if not required in any other case.

 SYED MUHAMMAD ATTIQUE SHAH, J.---
Accused-petitioner seeks his post arrest bail in case FIR No.274 dated 17.04.2017 under section 489-F of Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 registered at Police Station Cantt., Abbottabad.
2.
 The allegation against the accused/petitioner is that he has issued a cheque amounting to Rs.4,400,000/- to the complainant/respondent No.2 in connection with bargain of two vehicles, which was dishonoured on presentation in the concerned bank due to insufficient funds in his account.
3.
 Arguments of the learned counsel for the accused/petitioner and learned State counsel heard and record perused.
4.
 Perusal of record reveals that the cheque in question was issued by the accused/petitioner in connection with bargain of vehicles allegedly purchased by him from the complainant. However, at the moment there is nothing on record to suggest that any such transaction took place between the parties, as no documentary proof has been brought on record by the complainant despite direction by the Investigating Officer, which prima facie calls for further inquiry into the matter. Although the learned counsel for the complainant and the learned AAG have placed much emphasized over the conduct of the accused/petitioner as in the past as well, cases of similar nature has been registered against him but the accused/petitioner has been acquitted in four of the said cases, while two other cases which includes the present case have been recently registered on the report of the complainant and he has to prove the criminal culpability of the accused/petitioner regarding his dishonestly issuing cheques during the trial of the case. Moreover, the offence does not fall within the prohibitory clause of section 497, Cr.P.C, as the maximum sentence under section 489-F, P.P.C. is three years. In Zafar Iqbal's case (2009 SCMR 1488), a larger Bench of the august Apex Court has explicitly expressed the principles for considering the grant of bail, where offences do not fall within the prohibitory clause of section 497, Cr.P.C. The said principles have consistently been followed by the Honourable Supreme Court, as it has been held in Riaz Jafar Natiq's case (2011 SCMR 1708) that:
""Thus keeping in view the law laid down in the case of Zafar Iqbal v. Muhammad Anwar and others (2009 SCMR 1488) ordaining that where a case falls within non-prohibitory clause the concession of granting bail must be favourably considered and should only be declined in exceptional cases. We do not find this to be a case where it should be refused as an exception. Thus, this petition is converted into an appeal and the same is allowed and, resultantly, the petitioner is admitted to bail subject to furnishing bail bond in the sum of Rs. 1,00,000 (Rupees one hundred thousand only) with two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the learned trial Court.""
5.
 In any case, investigation in the present case is complete and the accused/petitioner is not required to the police for the purpose of further investigation. In peculiar facts and circumstances of the present case, no useful purpose is going to be served by keeping him behind the bars.
6.
 Consequently, this bail application is accepted and accused-petitioner, Zakir Qureshi son of Muhammad Zaman is admitted to bail, subject to his furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs.100,000/- (Rupees one lac), with two sureties, each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the Illaqa/Duty Magistrate, Abbottabad.
 Above are the detailed reasons for short order of this Court of even date.
7.
 The observations rendered hereinabove, would not affect the mind of the trial Court in any manner whatsoever, during trial of the case.

 MUHAMMAD TARIQ ABBASI, J.--
This petition, filed under section 561-A, Cr.P.C. carries the following relief:--
""It is therefore, respectfully prayed that the instant petition may ordered to be accepted and the order dated 10.04.2017 may ordered to be set aside, in the best interest of justice.""
2.
 Brief facts of the case are that the respondent No.1 has filed a private complaint under sections 337-F(i)/427/ 447/506/147/149, P.P.C., against the petitioners and six others in which the learned Judicial Magistrate Section-30, Jand, District Attock, through order dated 10.04.2017, has summoned the petitioners and the others, named in the complaint, to face the trial. Hence the petition in hand.
3.
 Arguments heard. Record perused.
4.
 It is noted that the petitioners have invoked the jurisdiction of this Court under section 561-A, Cr.P.C. The said powers and jurisdiction are discretionary in nature and are exercised only if the Court is satisfied that no adequate remedy is provided by law. The principles and law enunciated by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan has narrowed down the scope of the exercise of power under the above mentioned provision to an extent that the same can only be exercised sparingly and under extraordinary and exceptional circumstances. Exercise of powers under section 561-A, Cr.P.C. is an exception and not a rule. The Apex Court in a number of cases had laid down a criteria for interference of the High Court, in exercise of its jurisdiction under section 561-A, Cr.P.C. which are summarized as under:--
(i)
 The said provision should never be understood to provide an additional or an alternate remedy nor could the same be used to over-ride the express provision of law.
(ii)
 The said provision can ordinarily be exercised only where no provision exists in the Code to cater for a situation or where the Code offers no remedy for the redress of a grievance.
(iii)
 The inherent powers can be invoked to make a departure from the normal course prescribed only in exceptional cases of extraordinary nature and reasons must be offered to justify such a deviation.
The Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan while dealing with the question of exercise of jurisdiction under the above mentioned provision of law, in the case titled ""Chaudhary Munir v. Mst. Surriya and others"" reported as PLD 2007 Supreme Court 189, held as under:--
""....The powers as conferred upon High Court in section 561-A, Cr.P.C. being extraordinary in nature must be exercised sparingly with utmost care and caution and it should not be exercised in a casual and cursory manner because inherent jurisdiction as conferred upon the High Court pursuant to the provisions as enumerated in section 561-A, Cr.P.C. are neither ""alternative"" nor ""additional"" in its character and is to be rarely invoke only in the interest of justice so as to seek redress of grievances for which no other procedure is available and that the provisions should not be used to obstruct or divert the ordinary course of criminal procedure.""
5.
 The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners that the respondent No. 1 has filed the private complaint as a counter blast of FIR No. 194 dated 12.12.2012 got lodged by the petitioners' party and as such, the said complaint is not maintainable, is also without any substance because it is well settled proposition that when there are two versions of an incident, one version put forward by one party and counter version by its adversary, the trial Court while assessing evidence brought on record by the parties has to keep both versions in juxtaposition and then arrive at a final conclusion.
6.
 The mere claim of innocence by an accused could never be considered sufficient to justify such a departure from normal procedure because if this is so permitted then every accused would opt to stifle the prosecution and to have his guilt or innocence determined under section 561-A, Cr.P.C. The result would be decisions of criminal trials in a summary and cursory manner rendering the trials as a superfluous activity. This never was and could never been the intention of the law maker in adding section 561-A to the Code. Inherent powers can be invoked to make a departure from the normal course prescribed by law only and only in exceptional cases of extraordinary nature so that the powers meant to prevent the abuse of process of law, are not abused, themselves. 
7.
 Reverting back to the present case, filing of a private complaint, recording cursory evidence in it and then on the basis of available evidence, order for summoning of an accused, could not be termed as abuse of process of law. In this way, such like proceedings, could not be challenged under section 561-A, Cr.P.C, rather may be called in question, through a revision petition and that too, before the revisional court of first instance. The petitioners, instead of adopting the above mentioned legal mode of challenging the summoning order, through a revision petition before the competent court, are seeking quashing of the said order by way of the instant petition under Section 561-A, Cr.P.C, which being not competent and maintainable, is 
dismissed in limine.

 MAZHAR ALAM KHAN MIANKHEL, J.---
This appeal with leave of this Court is directed against the judgment dated 12.11.2012 of the High Court of Balochistan whereby the convictions and sentences awarded to the appellant by the trial Court were maintained/upheld by dismissing his appeal and Murder Reference No.01/2009 was answered in affirmative. The appellant was convicted by the trial Court under section 302(b), P.P.C. and was sentenced to death on two counts with a further direction to pay Rs.100,000/- as compensation to the legal heirs of the deceased persons Peer Muhammad and Muhammad Aslam as provided under section 544-A, Cr.P.C. He was also convicted under section 324, P.P.C. and sentenced to ten years' R.I. with fine of Rs.20,000/- and in default whereof to further suffer S.I. for two months.

2.
 The appellant Muhammad Saddique was indicted by the Sessions Judge Khuzdar, Balochistan to face trial in case FIR No.17/1999 levies dated 17.02.1999, Police Station Nall registered under sections 302, 324, 337, P.P.C. After full fledged trial, the trial Court vide its judgment dated 09-01-2.009 convicted appellant as above. The appellant then questioned his convictions vide an appeal before the High Court which was dismissed. Thereafter his Criminal Petition for leave to appeal before this Court was allowed vide order dated 30.09.2013. Hence this appeal.
3.
 We have heard learned counsel for the appellant as well as learned Additional Prosecutor General and have perused the record with their assistance.
4.
 The case of the prosecution is that on 17.02.1999 at about 9:00 a.m. the appellant allegedly fired at Peer Muhammad and Muhammad Aslam sons of Saleh Muhammad Complainant/PW-1 and his father Jumma Khan. The complainant who was present nearby his fields was attracted to the spot on hearing the fire shots. The moment he reached the spot, his two sons, who succumbed to the injuries, were lying in the pool of blood and mud whereas his father Jumma Khan was lying in an injured condition who informed him that Muhammad Saddique appellant (the real brother of the complainant, uncle of both the deceased and son of Jumma Khan injured) has fired at them and has decamped from the spot. The matter was accordingly reported and a proper case was registered against the accused/appellant vide above stated FIR.
5.
 Initially this case was tried by a Special Judge under the Suppression of Terrorist Activities (Special Courts) Act, 1975 (the 'Act of 1975') and the appellant was tried in absentia because of his absconsion and was convicted by the Special Judge but his conviction was set aside vide judgment dated 26.09.2007 by the High Court by way of his jail appeal after his arrest and a trial afresh was ordered by keeping the appellant as under trial prisoner. During the trial in absentia, complainant Saleh Muhammad appeared as PW 1, Lal Bukhsh son of Imam Bukhsh as PW-2, Jumma Khan son of Saleh Muhammad as PW-3, Dr. Ahmad Khan appeared as PW-4 and Mehboob Ali, Naib Tehsildar, who registered the FIR, appeared as PW-5.
6.
 Since the appellant was absconder so initially incomplete challan was submitted but for a trial afresh, complete challan was submitted by the SHO. Prosecution to prove its case against the accused/appellant again produced complainant Saleh Muhammad as PW-1 who narrated the story given in the FIR. PW-2 Dr. Ahmad Khan produced Medico Legal Certificate of Jumma Khan, injured PW, as Ex.P/2-A and death certificates of Peer Muhammad and Muhammad Aslam, the two deceased, as Ex.P/2-B and C respectively. Report of occurrence was recorded in the shape of FIR by Mehboob Ali, Naib Tehsildar who appeared as PW-3. Jan Muhammad appeared as PW-4 who initially informed the Naib Tehsildar Mehboob Ali. Nasir Khan SHO submitted the complete challan and appeared as PW-5. After recording of the prosecution evidence statement of accused under section 342, Cr.P.C. was recorded who simply denied the commission of offence. He refused to record his statement on oath under section 340(2), Cr.P.C. and also refused to produce any defence evidence on record.
7.
 The most important aspect in this case is that the only direct evidence available to the prosecution was the ocular account to be furnished by the injured eye-witness Jumma Khan, father of the complainant and the appellant but during the trial afresh, only the statement of CW-1 Abdul Karim son of Rehmat Ullah constable No.1476 was recorded who was given the task of service of summons of said Jumma Khan to appear in the Court as a witness. He by producing the certificate from the Local Nazim, disclosed that Lal Bakhsh and Jumma Khan PWs have met their natural death. Jumma Khan PW (appeared as PW-3 in trial in absentia) was the person who was an injured eye-witness of the occurrence and his evidence was the only direct evidence against the appellant but during fresh trial he along with Lal Bakhsh were reported to have met their natural death and were no more in this mortal world. The trial Court on receiving the death report from CW-1 straight away accepted and considered the earlier statement of said Jumma Khan without being brought on the record according to law and passed his judgment of conviction which too was upheld by the High Court through the impugned judgment.
8.
 The law on the point is very much clear and settled. When an accused is absconding, the trial Court has to issue proclamation and attachment under sections 87/88, Cr.P.C. When the absconsion is established and proved on the record, then the trial Court can proceed with the matter under section 512, Cr.P.C. and record the evidence of all the witnesses which later on can be used against the accused in the circumstances provided in section 512(1), Cr.P.C. But it was not the case where proceedings under section 512, Cr.P.C. were to be initiated and completed against the appellant rather the appellant was tried in absentia by the Special Court under the Act of 1975 as provided under section 5-A(4) of the said Act. The basic difference between the two is that in the former case, only evidence in absentia is recorded under section 512(1), Cr.P.C. which can be used against the accused in the circumstances as provided in section 512(1), Cr.P.C. but the Court cannot record conviction after recording evidence in absentia under section 512, Cr.P.C. whereas in the latter case, it is full fledge trial of the accused in absentia under section 5-A(4) of the Act of 1975 and the Court under Special Law is empowered to record conviction of the person in absentia as was done in the earlier trial of the appellant. While coming back to the facts and circumstances of the case, the High Court in earlier Jail Appeal after arrest of the appellant had set aside the conviction so recorded in absentia and sent back the case to the trial Court for fresh regular trial. Here in this situation the prosecution again was duty bound to lead entire evidence to prove its case beyond any shadow of doubt against the appellant. Prosecution has again produced available evidence but has not bothered to look after the ocular account earlier furnished by the injured eye-witness Jumma Khan who according to report met a natural death before initiation of the trial de novo. Such an evidence was necessary to prove the charge against the appellant. The law also caters for such like situation that when a witness meets a natural death or other circumstances as provided in Article 47 of the Oanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 before recording of his statement before the Court, then in that case the evidence of such person earlier recorded in any judicial proceedings or before any person authorized under the law to record the same becomes relevant for the purpose of proving those facts but it should be between the same parties or their representatives and that person is cross-examined during that process. Article 47 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 caters the situation which is reproduced for ready reference:-
47. RELEVANCY OF CERTAIN EVIDENCE FOR PROVING, IN SUBSEQUENT PROCEEDING, THE TRUTH OF FACTS THEREIN STATED.---
Evidence given by a witness in a judicial proceeding, or before any person authorized by law to take it, is relevant for the purpose of proving, in a subsequent judicial proceeding, or in a later stage of the same judicial proceeding, the truth of the facts which it states, when the witness is dead or cannot be found, or is incapable of giving evidence, or is kept out of the way by the adverse party, or if his presence cannot be obtained without an amount of delay or expense which, under the circumstances of the case, the Court considers unreasonable:
 Provided that:-
 the proceeding was between the same parties or their representatives-in-interest,
the adverse party in the first proceeding had the right and opportunity to cross-examine;
the questions in issue were substantially the same in the first as in the second proceeding.
 By keeping in mind the above provision of law and facts and circumstances of the earlier judicial proceedings against the appellant though in absentia but under the Special Law, it was the bounden duty of the prosecution to have brought the said evidence on the judicial record. The statement of said Jumma Khan was neither before the Court nor was brought on the record in accordance with law. The record of the case is completely silent in this regard. No doubt the statement of said Jumma Khan was recorded in the trial in absentia but that cannot be considered/looked into by the trial Court on its own especially when that has not been brought legally on the judicial file and is there in the file of trial in absentia. Besides the above all, not a single question of earlier statement of Jumma Khan recorded during the trial in absentia was ever put to the appellant during his statement recorded under section 342, Cr.P.C. Law on the subject is very much clear and settled that any peace of incriminating evidence must be put to accused in his statement under section 342, Cr.P.C. otherwise the same cannot be used against him. Here in this case, the trial Court has based its judgment of conviction by keeping in mind the earlier statement of the ocular account of Jumma Khan which legally was not before the Court and the long standing abscondence of the appellant. There is nothing on the record to establish the abscondence of the appellant in the shape of proceedings under sections 87/88, Cr.P.C. So, for that matter the appellant in reply to the question of his absconsion has simply denied.
9.
 Prosecution in this case has also failed to bring on record any supportive or corroborative peace of evidence to prove the guilt of accused. There is no recovery of weapon of offence. No motive is brought against the appellant. Though the question of Article 47 was agitated before the High Court in appeal but that was not appreciated by the High Court.
10.
 So, for what has been discussed above, we are of the considered view that the prosecution has failed to prove the guilt of appellant to the hilt. Resultantly, this appeal is allowed. The sentence and conviction of the appellant are set aside. He is acquitted of the charges. He shall be released forthwith, if not required or detained in any other case.
 The above are the reasons for our short order of even date which reads as under:-
""For detailed reasons to follow, this criminal appeal is allowed. The conviction and sentence of the appellant-Muhammad Siddique are set aside. He is acquitted of the charges. He shall be released forthwith, if not required or detained in any other case.""
MWA/M-54/SC
 Appeal allowed."

 MOHSIN AKHTAR KAYANI, J.---
Through this common judgment, I intend to decide all the captioned writ petitions as common question of law and facts are involved in all these writ petitions.
2.
 Through W.P. No.3908/2015 the petitioners have prayed for the following relief:--
(a)
 The requirement to appear in examinations at this belated stage, after 2 years and nine months in service, be declared to be without lawful authority.
(b)
 A declaration be issued that, the first examination held on 31 August till September 5, without prior training, is null and void.
(c)
 A declaration that, the Examination Committee comprising of only two Hon'ble Judges was violative of the adopted Rules, which prescribed a minimum of three Judges, to form the Examination Committee.
(d)
 A declaration that, the Petitioners are being discriminated against in service in complete disregard of Constitutional Guarantees/safe guards and therefore, the whole process and procedure is unconstitutional.
(e)
 A declaration that, since the Petitioners were entitled to four attempts in 24 months, which is not possible through no fault of their own, they are absolved from appearing in the examination, which stand dispensed with in KPK, Balochistan and Sindh High Courts.
Whereas, in W.P. No.3909/2015 same relief has been claimed by the other set of petitioners, therefore, there is no need to reproduce the prayer of said writ petition, whereas in W.P. No.4016/2015 petitioner (Islamabad Bar Association) has prayed for issuance of direction to respondent No.1 to initiate the process of Departmental Examination for Additional District and Sessions Judges appointed in September, 2012 as per Rule 20 (3) of Islamabad Judicial Service Rules, 2011.
3.
 Brief facts of the instant case(s) are that petitioners in W.Ps. Nos.3908 and 3909 of 2015 were appointed as Civil Judges-cum-Judicial Magistrates after due process of advertisement, written examination and interview conducted in all provinces as well as in FATA and finally the petitioners were appointed in Islamabad Judicial Service vide notification dated 22.09.2012. The petitioners are performing their duties since their date of appointment and presently conferred with powers of Civil Judge 1st Class vide notification dated 25.10.2012 and powers under section 30 of Cr.P.C. vide notification dated 26.03.2015 by virtue of up-gradation of their post vide notification dated 19.03.2014. The petitioners were never offered to undergo the departmental training in terms of Rule 20(3) of the Islamabad Judicial Service Rules, 2011 whereafter, the petitioners have to appear in Departmental Examination for their confirmation in Islamabad Judicial Service vide letter dated 23.06.2015 whereby the Islamabad Judicial Service Rules have been amended on 02.05.2015 through notification and the Punjab Civil Judge Departmental Examination Rules, 1991 have been adopted and the same were made applicable retrospectively to the extent of the petitioners who were appointed on 22.09.2012. Islamabad High Court vide notification dated 23.06.2015 directed the present petitioners to appear in Departmental Examination of Civil Judges-cum-Judicial Magistrates of Islamabad Judicial Service. The petitioners being aggrieved by the said notification challenged the same along with notification dated 16.11.2015 whereby the Islamabad High Court notified the results of first Departmental Examination held w.e.f. 31.08.2015 to 05.09.2015 whereby all the petitioners were declared fail in Departmental Examination and date of second Departmental Examination was notified, as w.e.f. 14.12.2015 to 19.12.2015. The petitioners have assailed both these notification through the instant writ petitions (W.Ps. Nos.3908 and 3909/2015).
4.
 Learned counsel for petitioners (in W.Ps. Nos.3908 and 3909/2015) argued that the impugned notifications dated 23.06.2015 and 16.11.2015 are void ab-initio, illegal, unlawful, arbitrary and against the rights of the petitioners; that there was no requirement of Departmental Examination existed in the appointment notification of the petitioners nor the same was prescribed in the Islamabad Judicial Service Rules, 2011 prior to the appointment of the petitioners; that Islamabad Judicial Service Rules do not provide Departmental Examination Rules whereas the Islamabad High Court has adopted the Punjab Civil Judges Departmental Examination Rules, 1991 which provides different mechanism and the same are not applicable in the case of petitioners; that petitioners have been discriminated as the Judicial Officers who were appointed in terms of Rule 2(h) of the Islamabad Judicial Service Rules, 2011 have not been asked to undergo similar examination prior to confirmation of their services; that petitioners are being discriminated as similarly placed Civil Judges-cum-Judicial Magistrates by Islamabad High Court appointed on 20.01.2015 were sent for exclusive training for a period of 3 months prior to taking charge of their posts. Even the conditions of examination for confirmation of Civil Judges-cum-Judicial Magistrates has also been dispensed with by the Hon'ble Peshawar High Court, Hon'ble High Court of Sindh and Hon'ble High Court of Balochistan and the concerned Civil Judges were confirmed in service on completion of probation period, that as per Rules 4(1) of the Punjab Civil Judges Departmental Examination Rules, 1991 the Chief Justice is required to constitute a committee comprising of three Judges of the Court for the purpose of conducting examination whereas in the case of petitioners the committee constituted by the Hon'ble Chief Justice of this Court was comprising of only 02 judges of the High Court; that as per Rule 4(3) of the said Rules the committee is required to hold, conduct and supervise the examination, whereas in the present case, the committee appointed an external examiner for the conduct of examination and setting of question papers and the same external examiner was entrusted with the task to evaluate and check all the answer sheets despite the fact that he was only engaged to set the papers and not to check and evaluate the same; that schedule given for the examination is in violation of the Punjab Civil Judge Departmental Examination Rules, 1991 (adopted rules) as four examinations have been scheduled within a period of 10 months and not in two years as specified in Rule 5 of the said Rules; that there is no alternate efficacious and speedy remedy available except to invoke the writ jurisdiction as the issue relates to fundamental rights of the petitioners. 
5.
 Conversely, learned counsel for Islamabad District Bar Association, argued that the instant writ petitions (W.Ps. Nos.3908 and 3909/2015) are not maintainable as the petitioners have no authority or right to challenge the departmental examination mainly on the ground that their terms and conditions of service were duly communicated to them in their notification of appointment dated 22.09.2012 and the same was accepted by the petitioners as a result whereof their notification for appointment was issued; that in terms of clause (i) of the notification of appointment the services of petitioners shall be governed by the terms and conditions given in the Islamabad Judicial Service Rules, 2011 and it has also been referred in clause (iii) that petitioners will be on probation for a period of two (02) years extendable for a further period of two (2) years and the relevant Rules, Rule 20 (3) of the Islamabad Judicial Service Rules, 2011 imposes a condition that no person shall be confirmed in a post unless he has successfully completed such training and passed such departmental examination as may be prescribed from time to time; that the Departmental Examination has been prescribed by the Islamabad High Court, therefore, the petitioners cannot claim any discrimination on the basis of said law; that petitioners have not challenged vires of any rule and it is not their case rather they are aggrieved by the second examination schedule as well as result of first Departmental Examination dated 16.11.2015 whereby all the petitioners have been declared failed.
6.
 Learned Advocate General, Islamabad has also represented the learned Registrar of Islamabad High Court, Islamabad whereby he argued that the instant writ petitions are not maintainable in terms of Article 199(5) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973; that the writ petitions have been filed against administrative order issued by Hon'ble Islamabad High Court and the same is not permissible in view of judgments reported as (2010 SCMR 632) ""Muhammad Iqbal and others v. Lahore High Court through Registrar and others"", (PLD 1998 Supreme Court 103) ""Muhammad Ikram Chaudhry and others v. Federation of Pakistan and others"" and (1991 MLD 2546 [Lahore]) ""Nusrat Elahi and 41 others v. Registrar Lahore High Court and 68 others. Learned Advocate General further argued that petitions suffer from laches and the petitioners acquiesced the holding of Departmental examination by sitting in first departmental examination and now they cannot take u-turn by challenging the same; that petitioners have not availed the alternate remedy before approaching this Court.
7.
 Arguments heard, record perused.
8.
 From the perusal of record it has been observed that the petitioners (in W.Ps. Nos.3908 and 3909/2015) were appointed as Civil Judges-cum-Judicial Magistrates after due process of advertisement, written examination and interview by the Islamabad High Court vide notification dated 22.09.2012. The petitioners at the time of their appointment accepted the terms and conditions referred in notification dated 22.09.2012 which are as under:-
(i)
 Their services shall be governed by the terms and conditions given in the Islamabad Judicial Service Rules, 2011;
(ii)
 They shall have to appear before a Medical Board for verification of good mental and physical state and being free from any physical defect likely to interfere with the efficient performance of their duties as a member of the Service;
(iii)
 They will be on probation for a period of two (02) years extendable for a further period of two (02) years;
(iv)
 They shall be subject to discipline as prescribed under rule 25 of the Islamabad Judicial Service Rues, 2011;
(v)
 They shall be liable to be transferred and serve anywhere under the administrative control of this High Court or anywhere within or outside Pakistan on any equivalent or higher post under the Federal Government or any local authority or statutory body setup or established by Government and serve anywhere on deputation in Pakistan under the Provincial Governments;
(vi)
 They shall be entitled to the scale of pay and other financial benefits including pensionary benefits as determined under rule 23 of the Islamabad Judicial Service Rules, 2011;
(vii)
 Their services during period of probation or extended period of probation may be dispensed with at any time without giving any prior notice;
(viii) If anyone of them wants to resign he may do so after giving one month prior notice to the authority, otherwise, one month pay shall be forfeited. The resignation shall, however, be subject to the acceptance by the Competent Authority;
(ix)
 No TA/DA shall be admissible for joining the service.
Whereas services of petitioners were governed by the terms and conditions given in the Islamabad Judicial Service Rules, 2011 and after acceptance of the above referred terms and conditions of appointment their names were notified as Judicial Officers. It has been observed from the record that the Hon'ble Chief of Islamabad High Court on the recommendation of Board (Judicial Selection Board) was pleased to appoint the petitioners as Civil Judge-cum-Judicial Magistrate (BPS-17) but their posts were upgraded from BPS-17 to BPS-18 vide notification dated 19.03.2014 however, in terms of Rule 20(3) of the Islamabad Judicial Service Rules, 2011 the Registrar of this Court issued the date sheet/schedule, syllabus for the first Departmental Examination of Civil judges-cum-Judicial Magistrates of Islamabad Judicial Service vide notification dated 23.06.2015. The Hon'ble Chief Justice, Islamabad High Court on the recommendations of Administration Committee has referred the amendment in the Islamabad Judicial Service Rules, 2011 which was notified vide Notification S.R.O. 395(I)/2015 dated 05.05.2015 whereby following amendments have been made:-
""In the Islamabad Judicial Service Rules, 2011, after sub-rule 3 of rule 20 following proviso shall be added:
""Provided that until Islamabad High Court frames its own Rules regarding Departmental Examination of Civil Judges/Judicial Magistrates, the corresponding Rules of the Lahore High Court, Lahore with such modifications/ changes as may be prescribed by Hon'ble Chief Justice on the recommendation of the Hon'ble Administration Committee, shall apply.""
In view of above amendment in the Rules, first Departmental Examination of Civil Judges-cum-Judicial Magistrates was notified and was held w.e.f. 31.08.2015 to 05.09.2015. All the petitioners participated in the Departmental Examination. However all the petitioners failed as per the notification dated 16.11.2015 whereas the petitioners had appeared in six different papers of Criminal Law, Civil Law-I, Civil Law-II, Revenue Law, Accounts and Shariah Law.
9.
 After the declaration of their results of 1st Departmental Examination the same notification contains second departmental examination date commencing w.e.f. 14.12.2015 to 19.12.2015 but all the petitioners assailed the same before this Court through W.Ps. Nos.3908 and 3909 of 2015.
10.
 The main grievance of the petitioners is relating to Rule 20(3) of the Islamabad Judicial Service Rules, 2011 however, in order to understand the analogy of the said Part-VIII of the Rules, Rule 20 is reproduced as under:-
""20.
 Probation
.---(l) The persons appointed to the Service at the first time appointment shall stand confirmed with effect from the date of their appointment:
Provided that they have been confirmed by their parent department otherwise they shall remain on probation for a period of one year.
(2)
 Save as provided in sub-rule (1), a person appointed to a post against a substantive vacancy shall remain on probation for a period of two years, if appointed by initial recruitment, and for a period of one year, if appointed otherwise:
Provided that the Appointing Authority may extend the period of probation by a similar term:
Provided further that a total period of probation shall not exceed four years in case of initial recruitment:
Provided also that the High Court may, in exceptional circumstances of any case, reduce the period of probation.
Explanation.---
Officiating service and service spent on deputation to a corresponding or a higher post may be allowed to count towards the period of probation.
(3)
 No person shall be confirmed in a post unless he has successfully completed such training and passed such departmental examinations as may be prescribed from time to time.
(4)
 If no order to the contrary has been made by the day following the completion of the initial probationary period, the period of probation shall be deemed to have been extended:
Provided that the officers confirmed on the posts of Civil Judges-cum-Magistrates and on the posts of Additional District and Sessions Judges shall not be required to be confirmed on the posts of Senior Civil Judges-cum-Magistrates and District and Sessions Judges respectively.
(5)
 Subject to the provisions of sub-rule (3), if no order has been made by the day on which the maximum period of probation expires, the probationer shall be deemed to have been confirmed in his appointment from the date on which the period of probation was last extended or may be deemed to have been so extended.
(6)
 A probationer, who has satisfactorily completed his period of probation against a substantive vacancy, shall be confirmed with effect from the date of his continuous appointment against such a vacancy:
Provided that where the period of probation has been extended under the provisions of sub-rule (2), the date of confirmation shall, subject to the other provisions of this rule, be the date on which the period of probation was last extended.
(7)
 If it appears to the High Court at any time during or at the end of the period of probation, or extended period of probation, as the case may be, that a probationer has not made sufficient use of his opportunities or has otherwise failed to give satisfactory performance, it may revert the probationer to his original post, if any, or if he does not hold a lien on any post, his services may be dispensed with.
(8)
 A person whose services are dispensed with or who is reverted under sub-rule (7) shall not be entitled to any compensation.""
In view of Sub-rule (3) of Rule 20 it is mandatory to complete training and to pass departmental examination as may be prescribed from time to time before confirmation of any person under Islamabad Judicial Service Rules, 2011, whereas, admittedly petitioners have never been directed to join training nor any training has been prescribed under the Rule till date however, the departmental examination has been prescribed notification dated 23.06.2015.
11.
 In view of above rules, term ""prescribed"" comes into play which requires a proper meaning. ""Prescribed"" means ""recommended with authority"". According to Ballentine's Law Dictionary, it means to lay down before hand as a rule, ordain, appoint, define authoritatively as a guide, direction, rule of action, defined in (PLD 1966 [Karachi] 483) ""General Manager, North-Western Railway v. Sher Muhammad"", (PLD 1982 Ouetta 1) ""Salooka Steels Ltd. v. Director General, Coast Guards, Pakistan"", (1991 CLC 1826 [Lahore]) ""Muhammad Hussain and 9 others v. Mst. Fatima and 2 others"" and (1992 PLC (CS) 421) ""Syed Sajid Hussain v. Ch. Muhammad Latif and others"".
12.
 In view of above referred judgments and terminology provided in the legal dictionary, the meaning of word ""prescribed"" has to been seen as referred above especially when the said term has not been explained or defined in the Islamabad Judicial Service Rules, 2011. The simple meaning of word ""prescribed"" means things which were already ordained/defined/recommended with authority prior to departmental examination in this case, however, I have gone through the notification dated 23.06.2015 wherein prescribed departmental examination has been notified to be taken from the present petitioners, hence, it can safely be concluded that Islamabad High Court being the competent authority has already prescribed/recommended the departmental examination whereas the training has not been prescribed so far, as a result whereof the petitioners have participated in the first departmental examination hence, they acquiesced the holding of departmental examination by sitting in the said examination and they could not wriggle out from the order of competent authority i.e. Islamabad High Court.
13.
 The other objection raised by the learned counsel for petitioners is that their maximum period of probation has already been expired and they are confirmed in terms of Sub-Rule (5) of Rule 20 of the Islamabad Judicial Service Rules, 2011. I have gone through the wording of Sub-Rule (5) of Rule 20 which is ""subject to the provisions of sub-rule (3)"" the expression subject to means ""conditional on, contingent on, dependent on depending on, controlled by hingeing on, resting on, hanging on"". Similarly, the said term has also been reported and defined in (2011 PTD 1460 [Karachi High Court]) ""A.P. Moller through Agent v. Taxation Officer of Income Tax and another"", wherein it has been held that:-
""18.
 The legislative device of subjecting a provision to other provisions of the statute (or even the whole of the statute) is of course well established. Its proper interpretation was explained as follows in C&J Clark Ltd. v. Inland Revenue 71 Commissioners (1973) 2 All ER 513 by Megarry, J (in the High Court):--
""In my judgment, the phrase 'subject to' is a simple provision which merely subjects the provisions of the subject subsections to the provisions of the master subsections. Where there is no clash, the phrase does nothing: if there is collision, the phrase shows what is to prevail. The phrase provides no warranty of universal collision."" (p.520; emphasis supplied)
In Harding v. Coburn (1976) 2 NLR 577), the New Zealand Court of Appeal observed:-
""The qualification, 'subject to' is a standard way of making clear which provision is to govern in the event of conflict. It throws no light, however, on whether there would in truth be a conflict without it. ""(per Cooke, J., pg. 582; emphasis supplied.
In Newcrest Mining (WA) Ltd. v. Commonwealth (1997) HCA 38; (1997) 190 CLR 513, the High Court of Australia was concerned with the interpretation of sections 51 and 122 of the Australian Constitution. It was observed as follows (internal citations omitted):
""In interpreting S.122 and its relationship with S.51 of the Constitution, the most striking feature of the relationship is that the powers conferred by S.51 are conferred 'subject to this Constitution' while S.122 is unqualified by that expression.... The use of the expression 'subject to this Constitution' does not itself mean that there is always conflict between S.51 and S.122. But it does mean that, where conflict exists, S.122 must prevail. As Megarry, J pointed out in C and J Clark Ltd. v. IRC (1973) 2 All ER 513, 520 '[w]here there is no clash, the phrase does nothing: if there is collision, the phrase shows what is to prevail.' In S v. Marwane 1982 (3) SA 717(A), 747-8, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa had to construe the words'[s] subject to the provisions of this Constitution'. Miller JA, giving judgment for the majority, said:
'The purpose of the phrase 'subject to' in such a context is to establish what is dominant and what subordinate or subservient; that to which a provision is 'subject', is dominant - in case of conflict it prevails over that which is subject to it. Certainly, in the field of legislation, the phrase has this clear and accepted connotation. When the legislator wishes to convey that that which is now being enacted is not to prevail in circumstances where it conflicts, or is inconsistent or incompatible, with a specified other enactment, it very frequently, if not almost invariably, qualifies such enactment by the method of declaring it to be 'subject to' the other specified one."" (emphasis supplied)
Finally, reference may be made to The South India Corporation (P) Ltd. v. The Secretary, Board of Revenue Trivandrum and another (AIR 1964 SC 207), where the Indian Supreme Court observed:---
""The words 'subject to other provisions of the Constitution' mean that if there is an irreconcilable conflict between the pre-existing law and provision or provisions of the Constitution the latter shall prevail to the extent of that inconsistency."" (para 23)
As these judicial observations indicate, the phrase ""subject to"" merely makes clear which provision is to prevail in case there is a conflict between two provisions. It does not however, in and of itself necessarily mean that there is or will be a clash or conflict between the dominant (or master) provisions on the one hand, and the subject provisions on the other. And it certainly does not mean that the provision being made ""subject to"" is to be applied as though every other provision of the statute is to be read into it.""
14.
 The above referred interpretation given in authoritative judgment of High Court clearly demonstrates that the term ""subject to"" donates a condition status and unless such condition has not been meted out the subsequent event do not apply whereas Sub-Rule (5) of Rule 20 clearly demonstrates that it is subject to the provision of Sub-Rule (3) which says ""no persons shall be confirmed in a post unless he has successfully completed such training and passed such departmental examinations as may be prescribed from time to time"". Hence, it can safely be concluded that Sub-Rule (5) is dependent upon Sub-Rule (3) of Rule 20 of the Islamabad Judicial Service Rules, 2011 and it cannot be interpreted independently nor its wording gives independent meaning on the basis of deeming cause referred in the said provision. In terms of Rules of interpretation of statute, it is settled that the rules should be read in harmonious manner and meaning should be given in a very simple and straight concept unless any other intention has been expressed by the legislator, therefore Sub-Rule (3) of Rule 20 of Islamabad Judicial Service Rules, 2011 has to be applied with all its requirements at the first instance in a manner provided whereafter Sub-Rule (5) is applicable.
15.
 Admittedly the petitioners appeared in the first departmental examination conducted by the Islamabad High Court and they failed, however, the second date-sheet was announced but they have assailed the same before this Court on different grounds i.e. discrimination qua previous batches of Judicial Officers as well as the completion of four years of their probation period. As far as the above mentioned two grounds are concerned, firstly, the discrimination has not been observed in this case as concept of discrimination applies when similarly placed people have been discriminated in terms of their same status however it can safely be concluded that petitioners fall under ""initial appointment"" and their appointment does not fall within the category of ""first time"" nor even fall under absorption category rather their cases falls within the terms referred in Rule 2(k) ""initial appointment"" which means appointment made otherwise than by promotion, transfer or first time appointment from another service, department, or organization, etc referred in the Islamabad Judicial Service Rules, 2011.
16.
 In view of above terms and conditions, petitioners can only be regulated under these rules and they have acknowledged the application of said rules by accepting the appointment letters issued to them. It has further been observed from the record that all the petitioners after acceptance of their terms and conditions referred above in notification gave their consent and as a result of said acceptance notification dated 22.09.2012 was issued by the order of Hon'ble Chief Justice of this Court, therefore, all the three batches referred by the petitioners have different appointment procedure and terms and conditions of their appointment have separately been notified under the Rules. It has further been observed from the record that petitioners who have filed their writ petitions before second departmental examination while assailing the second examination chance, voluntarily and un-intentionally deprived themselves from application of Sub-Rule (5) of Rule 20 of the Islamabad Judicial Service Rules, 2011 without considering the fact that Sub-Rule (5) is dependent upon Sub-Rule (3), in such case they are under obligation to complete such training and pass such departmental examination as may be prescribed from time to time however, the training has not been prescribed by the Islamabad High Court but departmental examination has been notified and prescribed, therefore, the petitioners have no right to say that they have been discriminated and they will not appear in any examination rather such kind of conduct amounts to serious misconduct and gives an impression that all the petitioners who themselves are Civil Judges-cum-Judicial Magistrates do not want to obey the Rules in letter and spirit. The petitioners have failed to establish any right for not taking departmental examination especially for the reason that they have not been subjected to any departmental training (if prescribed) whereas departmental examination is mandatory in terms of Sub-rule (3) of Rule 20 of Islamabad Judicial Service Rules, 2011.
17.
 Prior to conduct of departmental examination the petitioners were working as Judicial Officers for more than 03 years hence, their judicial experience is more than the training in respect of preparation for Departmental Examination and the petitioners cannot be allowed to avoid the departmental examination merely on the ground that they were not subjected to training as the training was not a pre-requisite for the appearance in the departmental examination. The use of word ""and"" in between the training and departmental examination along with term ""prescribed"" makes it clear that both the words have two separate conditions for confirmation. The word ""and"" has been defined in Oxford Thesaurus of English which gives the following meanings:-
""Conjunction together with, along with, with, as well as, in addition to, including, also, too; besides, furthermore, moreover.""
Therefore, both training and departmental examination are separate in their meaning unless any one has been prescribed or both have been prescribed by the Islamabad High Court. The requirements of departmental examination are clearly mentioned in Islamabad Judicial Service Rules, 2011 as Sub-Rule (3) of Rule 20 has been referred in the Islamabad Judicial Service Rules, 2011 which should be read as part of appointment notification dated 22.09.2012 at serial No.1 and petitioners terms and conditions have been governed under the said rules however, as far as the adoption of the departmental examination rules is concerned, same are procedural in nature and it is settled proposition of law that procedural law has retrospective effect even otherwise the training condition is not mandatory for the examination unless prescribed.
18.
 The above referred discussion has already fulfilled the requirements in explicit manner that unless anything has been prescribed the same shall not be applied whereas the training has not been prescribed till date by the Islamabad High Court however, there is no restriction or impediment upon the Islamabad High Court to prescribed departmental examination without any training and even petitioners could not demonstrate by any stretch of imagination that the notification for departmental examination is not within the purview and authority of Islamabad High Court. Moreover, the petitioners in any manner cannot challenge the holding of departmental examination by the High Court on the pretext that they have not been subjected to any training has no nexus with departmental examination because departmental examination relates to syllabus/ knowledge of petitioners whereas training is given for performing official duties assigned to the Judicial Officers as well as for practical work of Judicial Officers.
19.
 The amended proviso of Sub-rule (3) of Rule 20 of the Islamabad Judicial Service Rules further refers the application and adoption of the Punjab Civil Judges Departmental Examination Rules, 1991 wherein the relevant provisions are as follows:-
""3.
 Confirmation of Probationers
.---No Civil Judge shall be confirmed in the service unless he has passed the examination in all subjects specified in Schedule-I in accordance with these Rules.
4.
 Committee to conduct examination
.---(1) For the purpose of conducting examination under these Rules, the Chief Justice shall constitute a Committee of three Judges of the Court.
(2)
 The Registrar of the Court or any office nominated by the Committee shall act as Secretary to the Committee.
(3)
 The committee shall hold, conduct and supervise the examination in accordance with the syllabus mentioned in Appendix-II and the instructions issued by the Chief Justice or the Administration Committee of the Court.
5.
 Schedule of Examination
.--- Examination under these Rules shall be held twice in a year according to the programme to be announced by the Committee at least a month prior to the commencement of each examination.
6.
 Number of attempts
.---(1) A Civil Judge shall be eligible to appear in four successive examinations only beginning from the commencement of the examination held immediately after his appointment.
(2)
 A Civil Judge who fails to qualify the examination in four attempts allowed under the sub-rule (1) shall not be allowed to appear in a subsequent examination except with the permission of the Chief Justice.
Explanation.
 The examination may be qualified by parts but appearance in a part of the examination shall be counted as one attempt for the purpose of reckoning the number of attempts allowed by sub-rule (1) above.""
20.
 In view of above rules, rule 4 declares a committee to conduct examination comprising of three judges of the Court whereby this relates to second objection of the petitioners that the initial notification of examination committee comprises of two judge of Islamabad High Court which was constituted vide notification dated 19.05.2015 however, the said notification was rectified through a corrigendum dated 28.05.2015 whereby three Hon'ble Judge have been notified as the Committee for conducting of Departmental Examination of Civil Judge-cum-Judicial Magistrates of Islamabad Judicial Service whereas the said newly constituted committee of the departmental examination has conducted the first examination under the notification dated 23.06.2015 and the petitioners appeared in six papers w.e.f. 31.08.2015 to 05.09.2015 hence, the objection raised by the petitioners has not been justified from the available record and stands rejected in view of corrigendum referred by the Islamabad High Court.
21.
 As far as the stance taken by the petitioners that after completion of maximum period of four years, their probation period has completed and their services have automatically been confirmed, the same is without any legal backing because the petitioners' confirmation as prescribed in the rules is subject to passing of departmental examination and as such the confirmation of their probation is not simply connected with the completion of maximum probation period of four years rather the same is tagged with the condition of passing of departmental examination as such, the prayer of the petitioners to that extent is baseless and unfounded.
22.
 In last I have gone through the prayer of the petitioners whereby they claimed that they are entitled for the departmental training before conducting of departmental examination and the first examination which was taken by the external examiner has no legal effect. In this regard I am of the clear view that departmental examination committee in terms of the Punjab Civil Judges Departmental Examination Rules, 1991 is competent for the purpose of conducting of examination under the rules as the committee has been constituted by the order of Hon'ble Chief Justice of the Court whereby Sub-rule (3) of Rule 4 referred above clearly explains the powers to hold, conduct and supervise the examination in accordance with syllabus mentioned in appendix under the instructions issued by the Hon'ble Chief Justice or the Administration Committee of the Court, thus powers left nothing to any explanation nor give rise to situation to challenge the powers of the examination committee as the powers have been drawn from the orders of Hon'ble Chief Justice who has passed the same in the Administration Committee of the High Court which means all the orders have been passed by the full Court.
23.
 In order to understand the analogy of High Court, it is necessary to go through provisions of Article 175 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 whereby the establishment and jurisdiction of the Courts have been defined in Article 192, which provides the constitution of High Court whereby High Court shall consist of a Chief Justice and so many other Judges as may be determined by law, hence, I am of the clear view that the constitutional provisions are clear while establishing a High Court and in this regard whenever we are confronted with the situation regarding the definition of a High Court, it means the whole Court, the said analogy can safely be assumed in terms of section 3 of the Islamabad High Court Act, 2010 whereby it has been referred that Islamabad High Court shall consist of a Chief Justice and six others Judge to be appointed from provinces and others territories of Pakistan, in accordance with Constitution, therefore, it is clearly described in the law that High Court means the all judges of the High Court, hence, the order passed by the Administration Committee of the full Court including the Hon'ble Chief Justice of Islamabad High Court means the orders of the Islamabad High Court.
24.
 In order to deal with the maintainability of the instant writ petition, I am of the view that all the orders passed by the Islamabad High Court Administration Committee as well as by Examination Committee of High Court means the Islamabad High Court and the Registrar is just a conveying authority of the orders of the Islamabad High Court and against all the orders including the notifications issued by the Islamabad High Court no writ is competent.
25.
 In order to understand the reasoning of above mentioned question, it is necessary to firstly go through the Article 199 (5) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 which is reproduced as under:-
""199. Jurisdiction of High Court.-
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 (4)
 (5)
 In this Article, unless the context otherwise requires,-
""Person"" includes any body politic or corporate, any authority of or under the control of the Federal Government, or of a Provincial Government, and any Court or tribunal, other than the Supreme Court, a High Court or a Court or tribunal established under a law relating to the Armed Forces of Pakistan;""
The above referred Article excludes the Supreme Court, a High Court or a Court or tribunal from the definition of term ""person"" which is the main subject of Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. The above referred term clearly demonstrates that the framers of the Constitution are clear regarding the wisdom of the said definition whereas the judicial orders of the Supreme Court and High Court on jurisprudential plane were already protected from the exercise of writ. It is only the administrative/ executive or consultative functions/ orders and acts which have been saved under this sub-Article. However, in order to give reasons between the judicial orders and actions or orders made by the High Court or the Supreme Court in exercise of powers and functions in the office or being Members of the Court would be interpreted in the light of principle of comity which has been discussed in (PLD 1966 Supreme Court 1) ""Mian Jamal Shah v. The Member Election Commission, Government of Pakistan, Lahore and others"" wherein it has been held that:-
""there was an express provision to the effect that a decision by the Tribunal will not be deemed to be a decision by the High Court, but for the interpretation of Article 98, in respect of this question that consideration is not of appreciable weight. The learned Judges were in all probability right in considering the Member to be persona designata, and not the High Court or a Judge of the High Court, when acting under section 53, but one may be pardoned for referring here to a small observation in one of the judgments cited by the Full Bench with reference to the idea of a Superior. Court issuing a writ to itself, viz.:-
""the process involves the rather ludicrous position that Judge, are called upon themselves to show-cause to themselves""
why their orders should not be quashed. In the present case, the order in question is made by a Single Judge of the High Court acting as the relevant authority, but it is conceivable that a statute may appoint a Tribunal of say two or three High Court Judges to adjudicate matters arising thereunder, and then indeed the aspect of 'ludicrousness' might arise if a writ were sought from a Single Judge of High Court to avoid actions by such Tribunals. In a number of statutes in the United Kingdom express provisions are included which avoid the writ jurisdiction in relation to such adjudications, and it is a matter for consideration whether such provisions should not be made use of in Pakistan as well. Quite apart from the aspect of 'ludicrousness' there are other and more weighty considerations involved, such as the necessity of maintaining a high degree of comity among the Judges of the Superior Courts, which could be urged in support of such a provision.""
Similarly, in another judgment of four Hon'ble Judges of august Supreme Court in case reported as (PLD 1976 Supreme Court 315) ""Abrar Hassan v. Government of Pakistan and others"", the Apex Court after examining the provisions of Article 199 (5) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 discussed the scope and extent thereof whereby the principles of coordinate jurisdiction and comity among the judges has been discussed and logic has been referred with the following words:-
""The policy of law that no writ will issue to a High Court and Supreme Court is based on sound principles. If one Judge of a High Court were to issue a writ to another Judge under Article 199, the Judge to whom the writ is issued, may in exercise of the same jurisdiction nullify the writ This is the logical consequence of the fact that High Courts and them individual groups of Judges are invested with coordinate jurisdiction.""
It has further been declared by the apex Court that:-
""Another reason why writs should not issue from one High Court to another High Court and from one Judge to another Judge of the same High Court is that such a course will destroy the traditional high degree of comity among the Judges of superior Courts which is essential for the smooth and harmonious working of the superior Courts.""
It is also held that bar under Article 199 (5) could be directed in case of challenging the qualification to hold the office of a Judge of a High Court or the Supreme Court by way of writ in the nature of quo warranto which is exception to general rule.
26.
 Similarly, in another celebrated judgment given by five member bench of the apex Court reported as (PLD 1998 Supreme Court 103) ""Muhammad Ikram Chaudhry and others v. Federation of Pakistan and others"" wherein it has been held that:-
""8.
 There seems to be unanimity of view among the superior Courts on the question that a High Court or the Supreme Court cannot in exercise of its Constitutional jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution to interfere with an order passed by another Judge or another Bench of the same Court.
9.
 Then it was urged that the petitioners would have no remedy against a, patently illegal order. The factum that an aggrieved party may have no other legal remedy simpliciter will not bring his case within the purview of Article 199 of the Constitution if otherwise it does not fall within its compass.""
Similarly, another view of the apex Court rendered by 10 Hon'ble Judges of the Supreme Court reported in (PLD 1998 Supreme Court 161) ""Malik Asad Ali and others v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, Islamabad and others"" wherein it was held that:-
""Maintenance of high degree of comity between the Judges of superior Courts is neither a rule-of law nor a Constitutional requirement. It is only a highly desirable tradition which has existed for long and should continue to be followed by the Judges to maintain harmony and smooth working of the Courts, and also to preserve their institutional image in the eyes of the public. However, this high tradition of maintaining comity between the Judges of superior Courts cannot come in the way of discharge of more important Constitutional duty imposed upon the Judges of the superior Courts to protect and defend the Constitution under the oath of their office. Therefore, if the violation of a provision of the Constitution is brought to the notice of a Judge of the superior Court in a properly filed proceeding which involved the person of another Judge of the same Court, the relief in the absence of a Constitutional bar, cannot be declined relying on the principle of high tradition of maintaining comity between the Judges of the superior Courts. The proceedings in the nature of quo warranto confer jurisdiction and authority on superior Courts to control executive action in the matter of making appointments to public offices against the relevant statutory provisions. These proceedings provide a positive safeguard to citizens against usurpers of public offices, who, in some cases, may be allowed to continue to hold the office in connivance or with the help of the executive authority.
The actions of the Judge which relate to the performance of his duty and functions as a Judge of the Court or as a Member of the Court, cannot be brought under challenge under Article 199 of the Constitution before the High Court. Only such actions of a Judge of superior Court are amenable to the jurisdiction of High Court under Article 199 of the Constitution, which he performs in his personal capacity, having no nexus with his official functions as a Judge of the Court. The High Court, while hearing a case against the Judge of a superior Court under Article 199 of the Constitution, seeking information in the nature of quo warranto, which is maintainable."" (underlining is mine)
27.
 In view of above principles of law, rule of comity, the other aspect which has to be considered as to which view/judgment is to be followed is that in such situation the view expressed by bench of greater numerical strength is to be followed even if the view was expressed prior in time to different view expressed by a bench of smaller numerical strength at some subsequent stage some of the principles have been referred below from different judgments of the Apex Court:-
(i)
 ""We therefore, hold that the earlier judgment of equal Bench in the High Court of the same point is binding upon the second Bench and i f a contrary view had to be taken, then request for constitution of a larger Bench should have been made"". Reliance is placed upon (PLD 1995 Supreme Court 423) ""Multiline Associates v. Ardishir Cowasjee and 2 others"".
(ii)
 ""It may be pointed out that a bench of the same number of judges of the same High Court, or of the Supreme Court, can not deviate from view of the earlier bench, as rightly has been held in case of Multiline Associates in relation to a High Court"". Reliance is placed upon (1999 SCMR 2518) ""Babar Shahzad v. Said Akbar and another"" and (1999 SCMR 2883) ""Ardeshir Cowasjee and 10 others v. Karachi Building Control Authority (KMC), Karachi and 4 others"".
(iii)
 The above two principles have been taken into consideration in case reported as (PLD 2004 Supreme Court 600) ""All Pakistan Newspapers Society and others v. Federation of Pakistan and others.""
(iv)
 Principle laid down by any provision of law or Constitution by the larger bench has a binding effect over the smaller bench. Reliance is placed upon (PLD 2009 Supreme Court 879) ""Sindh High Court Bar Association through its Secretary and another v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Law Justice, Islamabad and others"".
(v)
 ""General rule as to which view/ judgment has to be followed. That in such situation usually the view expressed by greater numerical strength is to be followed even if the view was expressed prior in time to different view expressed by a bench of smaller numerical strength at some subsequent stage."" Reliance is placed upon (PLD 2013 Supreme Court 793) ""Hassan and others v. The State and others"". 
28.
 All the above referred principles laid down by the apex Court put emphasis that the view expressed by bench of greater numerical strength is to be followed. In view of above celebrated judgments of the apex Court, Constitution Petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 is competent if the petitioner could establish that challenge was to be the act of a judge in his private capacity or a persona designata or the appointment was being challenged by way of writ in the nature of quo warranto, therefore, in my humble view the writ petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 is not maintainable against the same Court or another bench of the same Court or against a judge of the same Court in terms of Article 199 (5) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 as held by the larger bench of the Supreme Court in (PLD 1998 SC 161), ""Malik Asad Ali v. Federation of Pakistan"".
29.
 The petitioners could not demonstrate from record any mala fide, any illegality in any manner and by filing the instant writ petitions, the petitioners are seeking a restraining order to conduct the departmental examination to be held w.e.f. 14.12.2015 to 19.12.2015 and subsequently in March, 2016 and July, 2016 but admittedly all these time lines have already been expired and not available to the petitioners even the time has been expired and petitioners have missed their valuable chances to appear in the departmental examination, therefore, their writ to that extent become infructious and rest of the claims are not founded on the legal principles.
30.
 It is settled proposition of law that writ petition is not maintainable in presence of any alternate remedy whereas the petitioners have filed their representations independently by raising certain issues including the objections on the syllabus of the examination, the said representations have been entertained and their grievances have been discussed by the competent authority and certain objections have validly been removed even during the pendency of these writ petitions a Tribunal has duly been constituted for redressal of all issues of the petitioners, therefore, in such eventuality when the alternate remedy is available the writ petitions are not competent.
31.
 From the perusal of record it has also been observed that objection was raised by the office at the time of filing of these writ petitions although, the objections were overruled at initial stage but I am of the considered view that the objections can be considered at later stage and it is prerogative of this Court to consider all these objections on the legal touch stone at the time of final hearing whereas it is settled proposition of law that writ is maintainable where no other alternate remedy is available and I am of the view that these writ petitions are not maintainable at the very inception and office had rightly raised the objection as all these orders which have been assailed in these petitions have not been passed by the Registrar of this Court rather the same are passed by the High Court. The petitioners have relied upon the recent judgment of Apex Court reported as (PLD 2016 SC 961) ""Ch. Muhammad Akram, Advocate High Court v. Registrar, Islamabad High Court and others"" decided on 26.09.2016, whereby question of certain appointments in the Islamabad High Court have been discussed whereby the issue of appointments of the administrative staff of the High Court falls within the administrative actions of the Court as the entire matter before the Apex Court is regarding the contract employees, deputationists, initial appointments, promotions/up-gradations and absorptions of the employees. It is apparent from the judgment of the Apex Court that there are certain illegalities which have rightly been pointed out in the said case before the Apex Court while appointing different individuals in the High Court establishment even the Apex Court has discussed each and every individual's case in the said petition and declared the appointments of the individuals as illegal. It is apparent from the said judgment that the matter was directly entertained by the Apex Court in terms of Article 184(3) the Constitution of Pakistan, 1973 and even otherwise the entire proceedings before the Apex Court were in nature of quo warranto which falls under exception of General Rule as held in (PLD 1998 SC 161) ""Malik Asad Ali v. Federation of Pakistan"". The case of the petitioners is distinguishable from the said case as the petitioners have failed to point out any illegality and even they could not demonstrate from the record that how a discretion can be exercised in their favour when they themselves have not qualified the first departmental examination rather by way of instant writ petition they are claiming the rights to be confirmed as Civil Judges-cum-Judicial Magistrates without going through the examination which is mandatory requirement under the Rules and even notified by this Court.
32.
 In such eventuality, if the petitioners are allowed to get through with such situation without departmental examination it means this Court further perpetuates the illegality which is against the mandate of law. Even it is settled proposition of law that no writ petition can be allowed to perpetuate the illegality. The petitioners have been estopped by their own words and conduct by appearing in their first departmental examination and they could not challenge the same when the results are different from their expectations even otherwise there are hundreds of thousands law graduates eager to join the judicial service on the positions of the petitioners, therefore, I am of the considered view that by way of claiming the exemption from examination and by challenging the subsequent departmental examination, the claim of the petitioners is to be considered against the law and cannot be allowed in any manner rather such kind of claim will further earn a bad name for the institution. Even otherwise, Sub-Rule (7) of Rule 20 of the Islamabad Judicial Service Rules, 2011 clearly imposes a duty upon the petitioners to use sufficient opportunities for their successful completion of probation which is subject to Sub-Rule (3) of Rule 20 and if the petitioners being probationer have not made sufficient use of opportunities or have otherwise failed to give satisfactory performance, their services may be dispensed with as a last resort, however, I have constrained myself from declaring any such action especially in presence of the Hon'ble Chief Justice, Judges and Administration Committee of this Court as well as in presence of Examination Committee.
33.
 In view of above, both the W.Ps. Nos.3908 and 3909/2015 are not maintainable as well as devoid of merits and same are hereby dismissed.
34.
 In addition to above, W.P. No.4016/2015 is also not maintainable as the Islamabad High Court has not yet framed its rules regarding the departmental examination of the Judicial Officers inducted in the Islamabad Judicial Service through initial appointment and corresponding rules of the Lahore High Court have been made applicable. Departmental Examination Rules of the Lahore High Court do not provide departmental examination for the Additional District and Sessions Judges before their confirmation. Even otherwise there is no precedent for holding of any departmental examination for confirmation of Additional District and Sessions Judges in all the provincial High Courts, therefore, any direction to amend the corresponding rules of the provincial High Court i.e. Lahore High Court cannot legally be issued. Even otherwise when the departmental examination has not been prescribed for the Additional District and Sessions Judges, the Islamabad Bar Association cannot claim and enforce the amendment of the rules by way of writ petition and it is the prerogative of the Hon'ble Chief Justice to interpret the rules if any question arises as to interpretation of the rules in terms of Rule 27 of the said Rules.
35.
 In view of above W.P. No.4016/2015 also stands dismissed.
36.
 Before parting with this judgment, it is necessary to dilate upon the remaining issues raised in instant writ petitions and keeping in view the valuable suggestions of Islamabad Bar Association, it is decided that:-
(i)
 Learned Registrar of this Court shall place this judgment before Hon'ble Chief Justice and Departmental Examination Committee of this Court and shall seek further directions regarding issuance of notification for Departmental Examination of Civil Judges-cum-Judicial Magistrates of Islamabad Judicial Service to be held within 03 months along with schedule of remaining chances.
(ii)
 It is expected from Hon'ble Departmental Examination Committee to initiate process of examination of all other remaining batches of Civil Judges-cum-Judicial Magistrates in the same schedule.
(iii)
 It is further expected from the Hon'ble Departmental Examination Committee to review the syllabus of Departmental Examination and exclude those subjects which relate to Punjab jurisdiction i.e. (1) The Punjab Tenancy Act, 1887 (2) Punjab Alienation of Land Act, 1900 (3) The Colonization of Govt. Land (Punjab) Act, 1912 (4) The Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1991, etc and are not applicable in Islamabad and add those subjects which are applicable in Islamabad like, Islamabad Rent Restriction Ordinance, 2001 etc.
(iv)
 It is also expected from Hon'ble Chief Justice to issue necessary notification of one time extension in probation period of petitioners while considering the services rendered by them as their main time period of probation has already expired during the pendency of instant writ petition due to status quo order passed by this Court.
37.
 It has further been observed that petitioners (Civil Judges-cum-Judicial Magistrates) have decided thousands of cases during the tenure of four years from date of their appointment, therefore, they should be treated with fairness and according to the principle of natural justice, hence, all the petitioners shall continue to work/act as Civil Judges-cum-Judicial Magistrates under their terms of appointment till passing of their remaining chances of departmental examinations within one time extended probation period.

 GHULAM MUSTAFA MUGHAL, J.---
The captioned appeal by leave of the Court arises out of the judgment of the High Court dated 28.9.2016 passed in Writ Petition No. 44 of 2013.
2.
 The precise facts forming the background of the captioned appeal are that respondent No.1 and proforma respondent No.6, herein, challenged the appointments of the appellant and proforoma respondents Nos.2 to 5, herein, through a writ petition before the Azad Jammu and Kashmir High Court on 27.11.2013 on the ground that the appointments have been made on political pressure without test and interview. It is claimed that the appellant, herein, could not be legally appointed because he was not in possession of the required qualification and his qualification was got relaxed illegally. The writ petition was contested by the respondent, therein, and it was stated that the appointments have been made after due proclamation in the newspaper by the competent authority and the qualification of the appellant, herein, was rightly relaxed by the competent authority. After necessary proceedings, the learned High Court through the impugned judgment accepted the writ petition partly and declared the appointment of the appellant, herein, for having been made without lawful authority. It was observed by the learned High Court that qualification cannot be relaxed by the competent authority and even the order of relaxation has been made on the simple application.
3.
 Ch. Muhammad Manzoor, the learned Advocate appearing for the appellant, contended that the appellant, herein, was son of a martyr and the Prime Minister has relaxed his qualification for that reason, hence, he was appointed. The learned Advocate, contended that the writ petition before the High Court was not maintainable because the appointment order of the appellant, herein, was issued on the recommendations of the respective selection committee on 6.7.2012. The respective selection committee was not impleaded as party in the line of respondents. The learned counsel placed reliance on an unreported case titled Saima Fareed and others v. Divisional Director Schools Elementary/ Secondary and others (Civil Appeal No. 220 of 2015 decided on 5.4.2017).
4.
 Sardar Muhammad Habib Zia, the learned Advocate appearing for respondent No.1, contended that no merit list was prepared by the selection committee rather the same was prepared by the District Education Officer (Male), Kotli, hence, the selection committee was not necessary party. The learned Advocate argued that relaxation in the qualification cannot be ordered and if it is assumed that the order can be passed by the competent authority, that too, can be ordered on a duly processed file. The learned Advocate argued that the appointment of the appellant was illegal and without lawful authority, hence, has rightly been declared as such by the learned High Court.
5.
 We have heard the learned Advocates representing the parties and gone through the record of the case. In view of the proposed conclusion, it is not necessary to go into details the judgment of the High Court. It has been forcefully argued on behalf of the appellant that his appointment was made on the recommendations of respective selection committee vide order dated 6.7.2017. The Committee has not been impleaded in the line of respondents, hence, the writ petition before the High Court was not maintainable in absence of necessary party. In the case titled Saima Fareed and others v. Divisional Director Schools and others (Civil Appeal No.220 of 2015 decided on 5.4.2017), referred to and relied upon by the learned Advocate for the appellant, similar proposition has been resolved. The relevant portion of the judgment is reproduced as under: 
""... All the orders annexed with the appeal speak that the same have been issued on the recommendations of Selection Committee, thus, in view of the factual proposition, the validity of the act of the Selection Committee is the basis of main controversy. The Selection Committee as a legal person has not been arrayed in the writ petition as party. Although, the Chairperson, Secretary and one member has been arrayed in their individual capacity but it is the spirit of constitutional provisions of section 44 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act, 1974 that the necessary party is one whose action has been challenged in the writ petition. In this case, the action of the Chairperson, Secretary or Member of the Selection Committee has not been challenged rather the action of the Selection Committee is challenged. The Selection Committee is a legal person and in view of the peculiar facts of this case unless the same is arrayed as party the writ petition is not maintainable. In this state of affairs, the High Court has rightly applied the principle of law laid down by this Court. On this proposition the impugned judgment does not suffer from any illegality or infirmity.""
 The contention of Sardar Muhammad Habib Zia, the learned Advocate for respondent No.1 that the merit list was not prepared by the selection committee, therefore, the selection committee was not necessary party, is devoid of any force. A perusal of the record reveals that, in fact, the appointment of the appellant, herein, was challenged, which was made on the recommendations of the respective selection committee, until and unless the selection committee is not arrayed as party in the line of respondents, the appointment of the appellant, herein, cannot be declared invalid.
 The result of the above discussion is that the appeal is accepted. The writ petition filed against the appointment of the appellant, herein, before the learned High Court, is hereby dismissed.

 ABDUL SHAKOOR, J.---
Through the instant petition under sections 439/435 read with section 561-A, Cr.P.C., the petitioner Mst. Gul Noora has called in question the order dated 23.01.2017 rendered by learned Additional Sessions Judge-IV, D.I. Khan, whereby accused Muhammad Khan alias Muhammad was declared as proclaimed offender and perpetual warrant of arrest was issued against him.

 The brief facts giving rise to the instant petition are that on the report of petitioner, a case vide FIR No.385 dated 04.10.2014 was registered at Police Station Saddar, D.I. Khan under sections 302/324/ 148/149, P.P.C. against accused Gul Rehman alias Bilal, Gulab Khan, Fazal Rehman, Muhammad Khan alias Muhammad and Abdur Rehman. Complete challan against the accused was submitted before the learned trial Court. In the meanwhile, legal heirs of deceased Rehmatullah and Zar Muhammad entered into compromise with the accused and submitted relevant documents before the learned trial Court. The learned Additional Sessions Judge-IV, D.I. Khan recorded joint statement of Mst. Gul Noora (widow) and injured Mamoon (son) of deceased Rehmatullah who stated that they have patched up the matter with all the accused including absconding accused and pardoned them in the name of Allah Almighty by waiving of their rights of Qisas and Diyat. The learned Court also recorded the statement of Faridullah, son of deceased Zar Muhammad. He stated his father Zar Muhammad was murdered and to this effect, report was lodged by Mst. Gul Nooran Bibi who charged accused Gul Rehman alias Bilal, Fazal Rehman, Haji Gulab, Abdur Rehman and Muhammad Khan. He further stated that he has patched up the matter with the accused party and pardoned them in the name of Allah Almighty. Similarly, joint statement of Mst. Shahida Bibi (widow) and Mst. Gul Sarwara Bibi (mother) of deceased Zar Muhammad was recorded who also stated to have patched up the matter with the accused party. Thereafter, the learned Additional Sessions Judge-IV, D.I. Khan acquitted accused Gul Rehman alias Bilal, Gulab Khan and Fazal Rehman and declared accused Muhammad Khan alias Muhammad as proclaimed offender and issued perpetual warrant of arrest against him vide judgment dated 23.01.2017, hence the instant criminal revision by complainant Mst. Gul Noora.
3.
 We have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Additional A.G. representing the State and have gone through the record.
4.
 Perusal of record reveals that the offences with which the accused including the absconder are charged, are legally compoundable. The legal heirs of both the deceased and the injured categorically stated in their statements before the learned trial Court that they have patched up the matter with the accused facing trial and the absconding accused, have pardoned them in the name of Allah Almighty and have no objection if they are acquitted on the basis of compromise. Under Islamic law, there is no provision that in any case of a compoundable offence, the accused person can be forgiven only and only when he agrees to being forgiven. There is an example that when the Holy Prophet (S.A.W.W.) visited Taif and the street urchins of Taif, upon instigations by the notables of Taif, pelted Holy Prophet with stones and according to historians, so much so that the blood of the Holy Prophet dropped into his shoes, the Holy Prophet instead of praying for God's wrath angers upon the residents of Taif, forgave and prayed for their forgiveness. Keeping in view such golden Islamic principles, it would not be in the interest of justice to indulge ourselves into technicalities that accused Muhammad Khan alias Muhammad was an outlaw and did not appear either before the investigating agency or before the Court. When legal heir of both the deceased and the injured have settled their differences also with accused Muhammad Khan alias Muhammad, the order of learned trial Court issuing perpetual warrant of arrest against him is legally incorrect and not sustainable. Reliance in this respect can be placed on the case of Muhammad Nawaz and others v. State (1998 MLD 1 Lahore).
5.
 For the reasons mentioned above, we allow the instant criminal revision, set aside the impugned judgment dated 23.01.2017 of learned Additional Sessions Judge-IV, D.I. Khan to the extent of issuance of perpetual warrant of arrest against accused Muhammad Khan alias Muhammad and acquit him of the charges on the basis of compromise.

62,"SAADULLAH Versus State","June 5, 2017","QUETTA HIGH COURT BALOCHISTAN"," Honorable Justice Abdullah Baloch ","2017 YLR 2434","JUDGMENT
 ABDULLAH BALOCH, J.---
This judgment disposes of Criminal Appeal No.140/2009 filed by the appellant Saadullah son of Bor Muhammad, against the judgment dated 30th April 2009 (hereinafter referred as, ""the impugned judgment"") passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge-I Quetta (hereinafter as, ""the trial Court""), whereby the appellant was convicted under Section 302(b), P.P.C. and sentenced to suffer life imprisonment with fine of Rs.100,000/- (Rupees One Lakh), which in case of recovery was directed to be paid to the legal heirs of deceased Bibi Hafeeza under section 544-A, Cr.P.C. as compensation and in default thereof to further suffer one (01) year R.I., with the benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C.
2.
 Facts of the case are that on 25th August 2001, the complainant Muhammad Ismail, Head Constable lodged FIR No.141/2001 at Police Station Civil Line Quetta under Section 302 Q&D read with section 353, P.P.C. stating therein that he along with other police officials and a lady Constable Bibi Hajira went to Darulaman ( ) for the purpose of bringing Mst: Hafeeza to the Court for hearing of a case, hence they took the lady along with one Watchman Suleman in official vehicle and proceeded towards Sessions Court's premises. He and lady Constable Hajira Bibi alighted the Hafeeza Bibi from Suzuki and were proceeded towards main gate of Sessions Court, but at about 9.15 a.m. no sooner they reached at main gate of Sessions Court then a person already standing there made firing upon Mst. Hafeeza with pistol, who received two bullets on her person i.e. one bullet below the right eye while the other on the abdomen. The police officials apprehended the appellant along with pistol, who on query disclosed his name as Saadullah and stated that he is the brother of lady Mst. Hafeeza. He further disclosed that the lady was kidnapped from Pishin and the case of her kidnapping is pending before Ad hoc Sessions Judge Quetta. The lady was taken towards hospital by ASI Jehangir, but in the way to hospital, she succumbed to the injuries.
3.
 In pursuance of above FIR, investigation was conducted by PW-10 Faiz Ahmed Bhatti, IP/IO, who inspected the site and prepared site map, carried out proceedings under Section 174, Cr.P.C. and prepared inquest report; took into possession the blood stained clothes, chaddar/scarf, earth etc.; seized the crime weapon i.e. pistol containing 03 live cartridges and sent the same to FSL for analysis; took into possession two empties from the place of occurrence; recorded the statements of witnesses under section 161, Cr.P.C.; got recorded the confessional statement of appellant under section 164, Cr.P.C. and on completion of investigation submitted the challan in the trial Court.
4.
 At the trial, the prosecution produced ten (10) witnesses. The appellant was examined under section 342, Cr.P.C. The appellant recorded his statement on oath under section 340(2), Cr.P.C., and also produced three witnesses in his defence. On conclusion of trial, vide judgement dated 24th September, 2001 the appellant was convicted under Section 311, P.P.C. and sentenced for fourteen (14) years, whereas he was acquitted from the charge under Section 353, P.P.C. It appears from the record that the appellant assailed his conviction before this Court through Criminal Appeal No.244/2001, whereas Criminal Revision Petition No.123/2001 was filed by the State for enhancement of his sentence. After hearing this Court dismissed the criminal appeal filed by the appellant, whereas the Criminal Revision Petition filed by the State was accepted and the sentence of the appellant was enhanced to life imprisonment, vide judgment dated 29th July 2003. Thereafter, the appellant as well as the State approached the Hon'ble Supreme Court by filing Criminal Appeal No.257/2003, while the State filed Criminal Revision Petition No.374 of 2003. After hearing the Hon'ble Supreme Court on 19th November 2008 dismissed both the appeal and the petition and remanded the case to the trial Court for deciding the compromise deed/application under section 345, Cr.P.C. as well as to determine the relationship of Muhammad Fayyaz with the deceased. After remand of the case and as per directions of Hon'ble Supreme Court, the learned trial Court has formulated the following two questions for determination:--
1.
 Whether Muhammad Fayyaz was husband of deceased Hafeeza Bibi?
2.
 Whether Muhammad Fayyaz is and can be legal heir of deceased Hafeeza Bibi according to section 345 Cr.P.C.?
5.
 After formulation of above points/questions, the trial Court directed the State to produce Muhammad Fayyaz, but the summons so issued could not be served and ultimately the statements of CW-1 and CW-2 were recorded, according to whom the said Fayyaz had shifted to some unknown place. In support of his contention the accused produced record of cases registered at Pishin through record-keeper of Sessions Judge Pishin as CW-3, who produced the documents of record, on the other hand the prosecution further produced the record of cases bearing FIR No.45/1998 and FIR No.49/1998 of Levies Headquarter Pishin through CW-3 and CW-4. Thereafter the arguments were heard and vide impugned judgment the trial Court after declaring Muhammad Fayyaz as legal heir and husband of deceased Bibi Hafeeza has dismissed the compromise deed/application under Section 345 Cr.P.C. and convicted and sentenced the appellant as mentioned above. Whereafter instant appeal has been filed.
6.
 Learned counsel for appellant contended that the impugned judgment is result of misreading of the evidence available on record; that the offence under Section 302, P.P.C. is compoundable in nature and the legal heirs of deceased have entered into legal compromise, but the same was rejected on the ground that Muhammad Fayyaz was her husband and he has not compromised the matter, but the learned trial Court has ignored this important aspect of the case that two separate FIRs i.e. for abduction and under Hadood cases were registered against the appellant and even no valid Nikkah Nama or oral evidence was produced to establish that any Nikkah was performed, hence in no manner said Muhammad Fayyaz can be termed to be the husband of deceased and he is not her legal heir; that Muhammad Fayyaz did not appear before the Court in spite several opportunities; that deceased Mst. Hafiza fully implicated the Fayyaz for commission of offence, but this important evidence was not taken into consideration; that the trial was wrongly influenced by the findings of the learned Ad hoc Sessions Judge, whereby Fayyaz was acquitted of the charge; that the learned trial Court has mis-appreciated the evidence brought on record.
7.
 On merits, the learned counsel for appellant further contended that the impugned judgment is perverse and contrary to the material available on record; that the police officials in order to show their efficiency have wrongly implicated and involved the appellant in the case in hand, whereas the appellant has no concern or nexus with the crime; that the alleged confessional statement is result of torture and coercion and even recorded after considerable delay, thus not admissible; that since the alleged murder was committed in the police custody, thus the police is interested party, whereas the prosecution has only produced the evidence of interested witnesses, thus the case of prosecution is lacking independent corroboration; that all the witnesses made contradictory statements to each other and the prosecution has badly failed to establish the charge against the appellant beyond the shadow of reasonable doubt.
8.
 On the other hand, learned Deputy Prosecutor General contended that sufficient incriminatory evidence is available on record to establish the fact that the deceased had contracted marriage with Muhammad Fayyaz and being the husband of deceased, the said Muhammad Fayyaz is legal heir and without him no effective compromise can be effected, whereas the learned trial Court had rightly dismissed the compromise deed; that the prosecution witnesses through independent corroborative evidence has succeeded in establishing the charge against the appellant, who otherwise was caught red handed along with crime weapon and the appellant has failed to bring on record any iota of evidence establishing his false implication, thus the appeal deserves dismissal.
9.
 Heard the learned counsel and perused the record minutely with their able assistance. Perusal of record reveals that at the first round of litigation the trial Court convicted and sentenced the appellant for 14 years under Section 311, P.P.C. and this Court had not only maintained the sentence, but also enhanced the same to that of life imprisonment, but the case was remanded by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan to the trial Court with the directions to first determine the relationship/status of deceased with Muhammad Fayyaz and thereafter to decide the compromise deed under Section 345, Cr.P.C. However, after remand, the said Muhammad Fayyaz despite issuing summons did not appear before the Court and as per statement of CWs, who was shifted to an unknown place, thus the trial Court recorded the statements of four CWs, who produced the record of cases registered earlier against said Muhammad Fayyaz. In order to resolve the issue of relationship in between the deceased and Muhammad Fayyaz as well as the validity of compromise deed, at first instance we have to analyze the record produced through CWs with regard to cases registered for alleged abduction of deceased and committing Zina with her by said Muhammad Fayyaz.
10.
 The admitted feature of the case is that the appellant was the brother of deceased Mst. Hafeeza, who had liaison with Muhammad Fayyaz. Initially, on 8th August 1998 the father of deceased lodged FIR No.45/1998 at Levies Headquarter Quetta district Pishin under sections 365, 109, P.P.C. read with Sections 9/14 of Hadood Ordinance by nominating Muhammad Fayyaz and others with the allegations of abducting his daughter (deceased) from his house. It appears from the record that the police arrested the said Muhammad Fayyaz and deceased from Faisalabad and they were shifted to Pishin. The statement of deceased under section 161, Cr.P.C. was recorded on 18th August 1998, wherein she had admitted her liaison with Muhammad Fayyaz. She further admitted when Muhammad Fayyaz at night time came to her house by scaling the wall, she joined him by eloping her parents' house and also took some clothes etc. Such statement was reiterated by the deceased in her Court's statement recorded in the case of abduction. The deceased during trial of case remained in Darul-Amaan. It is pertinent to mention here that during trial of the case the deceased on 18th July 2001 had submitted an application to the trial Court requesting for handing over her custody to the mother of Fayyaz or to Edhi Center or to judicial custody.
11.
 The minute scrutiny of deceased's statements recorded in the case of her alleged abduction both by the I.O. and during trial, would make it clear that the deceased was not abducted rather out of her free will and consent she eloped her parents' house, otherwise the abduction of deceased from her parents' house where other inmates were also present was not possible if the deceased had made any resistance or hue and cries at the time of her alleged abduction or subsequently when she was being taken to somewhere else Quetta and thereafter to Faisalabad. Since, in her statements allegedly the deceased had alleged commission of Zina with her by Muhammad Fayyaz, thus second FIR No.49/1998 under Section 11 of Zina (Enforcement of Huddood) Ordinance was registered, but while examining in the Court the deceased had specifically stated that Muhammad Fayyaz is her husband and she out of her free will and consent eloped her parents' house and joined Muhammad Fayyaz, who had taken her to his relative's house, wherein her Nikkah was performed. The deceased further added that in the previous case of her abduction she due to fear and pressure of her parents deposed falsely against her husband.
12.
 The record further reveals that on conclusion of trial in both the cases, Muhammad Fayyaz was acquitted of the charge as neither the allegations of abduction were proved nor commission of Zina was established rather according to the statement of deceased in Hadood case that she married with Muhammad Fayyaz. Even otherwise, the postmortem report of deceased is indicative of the fact that at the time of her murder she was pregnant. Furthermore, after acquittal of Muhammad Fayyaz in both the cases of alleged abduction as well as in Hadood case the parents of the deceased had not assailed the acquittal order before the higher forums, thus the acquittal orders attained finality.
13.
 From perusal of both the judgments in the said cases, it has been established that the deceased had not only eloped her parents' house with her free will and consent, but also, she had contracted marriage with Muhammad Fayyaz, thus the said Muhammad Fayyaz being the husband of deceased lady is termed to be her legal heir. So far as, the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that no documentary evidence or Nikkah Nama or Nikkah Khuwan was produced to establish the solemnization of Nikkah is concerned, the fact remains is that there is no bar on oral Nikkah, specially in our tribal and traditional society the marriages are being solemnized orally, even otherwise the findings of learned Sessions Judge Ad hoc remained unchallenged and attained finality. However, mere his non-appearance does not disentitle him from the legal heirship of the deceased. Admittedly, Muhammad Fayyaz being legal heir of deceased is also entitled for Qisas and Diayat. Besides he has every right to enter into compromise, claim Badle-Sullah pardon anyone or Afw or take his share from the Diyat regarding murder of his wife and without his participation no effective compromise could be effected, thus the learned trial Court has rightly dismissed the compromise deed. Reliance in this regard is placed on the case of Muhammad Amin v. The State, 2016 SCMR 116, wherein it has been held that, ""Another factor having some bearing upon the question of the appellant's sentence is that the husband of the deceased, on his own behalf as well as on behalf of the minor children of the deceased, had forgiven the appellant and had entered into a compromise with him which compromise was not given effect to by the courts below because the compromise was incomplete. It has been clarified by Supreme Court in the case of Abdul Ghaffar and others v. The State (2015 SCMR 1064) that a partial compromise may not have any bearing upon conviction of an accused person in a case of Ta'zir but it may have, in the circumstances of a given case, some relevance to the question of sentence in such a case. In the above mentioned circumstances of this case we have felt persuaded to reduce the appellant's sentence of death to imprisonment for life on the charge under section 302(b), P.P.C. This appeal is, therefore, dismissed to the extent of the appellant's conviction for an offence under section 302(b), P.P.C. recorded and upheld by the courts below but the same is partly allowed to the extent of the appellant's sentence which is reduced from death to imprisonment for life. The benefit under section 382-B, Cr.P.C. shall be extended to the appellant. This appeal is disposed of in these terms.""
14.
 Now adverting to the merits of the case, it is evident from record that the unnatural death of deceased Mst. Hafeeza is not disputed. The appellant admitted the unnatural death of deceased during trial, but pleaded his false implication by the police. PW-2 Dr. Farida, Medico Legal Officer, examined the deceased and confirmed that the deceased had received two bullet injuries in her person and further opined the cause of death due to injury on vital organ in cranial of abdominal cavity bleeding to intra and extra cranial-abdominal haemorrhage shock and death and injuries mentioned were caused by fire arm. PW-2 issued medical certificate Ex.P/2-A, which confirms the unnatural death of deceased.
15.
 Adverting to the statements of eye-witnesses, suffice to observe that the prosecution in order to substantiate the charge has produced the evidence of ten witnesses. The complainant of the case appeared as PW-1, who reiterated the contents of FIR. According to PW-1 on the day of occurrence he along with Constable Saadullah, lady Constable Bibi Hajira (PW-4) took the deceased from Darul-Amaan in an official vehicle and accompanied Watchman of Darul-Amaan Suleman (PW-3) towards Sessions Court and when they reached near Sessions Court main gate, the appellant already standing there opened firing upon the deceased, due to which two bullets hit to the deceased, who fell down and while shifting to hospital she succumbed to the injuries. PW-1 further added that he along with other police officials already present there apprehended the appellant and recovered the crime weapon. PW-3 and PW-4 fully corroborated the statement of PW-1 and reiterated the statement on PW-1 by correctly mentioning the date, time, the place of occurrence and the manner in which the appellant appeared at site and fired upon the deceased. The statements of PW-1, PW-3 and PW-4 have fully been corroborated by the other eye-witnesses, who were present in the Sessions Court premises. PW-6 Muhammad Jahangir, ASI, stated that he was present in the Court premises for recording his statement in another case, when heard the voice of firing, thus rushed towards gate and along with the complainant and others apprehended the appellant and recovery of pistol was effected from his possession. PW-6 is also the witness of recovery memo of crime weapon Ex.P/6-B, blood stained earth Ex.P/6-C and empty cartridges as Ex.P/6-D.
16.
 The minute scrutiny of statements of all the above witnesses being natural witnesses justifies their presence at the time and place of occurrence, as the PWs-1, 3 and 4 were deputed to bring the deceased to Sessions Court in hearing of the case, while PW-6 was already present in the Court for recording his statement in another case. All the witnesses correctly identified the appellant in the Court being assailant, who had committed the murder of deceased and was caught red handed along with the crime weapon. Furthermore, none of the witness had known the appellant previously and even they had no ulterior motives to falsely implicate the appellant in the crime. The learned counsel for the appellant made an unsuccessful attempt to discredit the evidence of eye-witnesses being police officials, but legally the police officials are as good witnesses as the private witnesses and their testimony cannot be discarded solely on the ground that they are police officials until and unless the defence succeeds in proving any ill-will or mala fide on the part of police officials. The police officials cannot be declared as interested witnesses merely on the basis of murder of a deceased committed by the assailant when she was in the police custody rather being deputed on the duty of deceased to produce her before the Court, the police officials are natural witnesses and their testimony can be considered a solid piece of evidence. Besides, none of the witnesses was derailed from the prosecution story while recording their statements in the Court, but to the contrary their statements are in line and corroborating each other on all material counts. The witnesses were cross examined at considerable length, but nothing advantageous favouring the defence has come on record. Even, the defence has failed to give slightest damage or dent to the testimony of prosecution witnesses.
17.
 The case of prosecution has further been strengthened from the recovery of crime weapon. Admittedly, the appellant was caught red handed soon after the occurrence and the police snatched the crime weapon i.e. pistol from him and the same was taken into possession through seizure memo. Besides, two empties were also recovered from the place of occurrence. The DWs appeared on behalf of the appellant also confirms the recovery of crime weapon from the possession of the appellants PW-8 has produced the arm licence issued in the name of the appellant.
18.
 The case of prosecution has further been strengthened from recording the confessional statement of the appellant. Careful perusal of confessional statement of appellant establishes the fact that the learned Judicial Magistrate (PW-5) before recording such statement had introduced himself before the accused and also explained the consequences of such statement during trial of the case being used against him, besides assuring the appellant that he is in safe custody and thereafter being satisfied he commenced with recording the confession, therefore, mere retraction of the appellant from the confessional statement is not enough to effect its validity.
19.
 Now adverting to motive behind the occurrence, which is strong enough to provoke the appellant to commit the murder of his deceased sister, who had eloped her parent's house and without the consent and knowledge of her parents contracted marriage with a stranger in violation of customs and traditions of our society.
20.
 We have also perused the impugned judgment delivered by the learned trial Court and observed that the appellant was rightly found guilty of the charge. The learned trial Court has rightly appreciated the evidence so brought before him and each and every aspect of the case was discussed in detail as per directions of Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, hence the learned counsel for the appellant has failed to point out any illegality and irregularity in the impugned judgment for interference of this Court.
 For the reasons discussed hereinabove, the appeal being devoid of merits is dismissed. The appellant is on bail; be taken into custody and be sent to District Jail Quetta for serving his remaining period of sentence. The appellant shall also enjoy the benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C.

63,"Malik TARIQ MAHMOOD Versus GHULAM AHMED","June 5, 2017","SUPREME COURT"," Honorable Justice Sajjad Ali Shah ","2017 PLD 674","ORDER
 SAJJAD ALI SHAH, J.---
This appeal, with leave of this Court, arises from the order of the Lahore High Court whereby the learned Judge in Chambers while upsetting the order of the Additional District Judge, Ferozewala restored and remanded the suit of the respondent/pre-emptor for trial afresh.
2.
 The admitted facts presented before us are that the respondent/pre emptor, on 11.8.2006, filed a suit seeking enforcement of pre-emptory rights against the appellant in respect of land measuring 110 kanals, 7 marlas, situated at Monza Qilla Sattar Shah, Tehsil Ferozewala, District Sheikhupura. Since the plaint was accompanied with an application under Order XXXIX, C.P.C., therefore, it was placed in Court on the same day and the Court directed issuance of notices for 2.9.2006. On 2.9.2006 the Court, while directing issuance of summons for 11.9.2006, directed the private respondent to deposit the zar-e-soim by the next date of hearing. It appears that the respondent/pre-emptor, on 7.9.2006, moved an application seeking extension of time for depositing the zar-e-soim at his own risk, which application came up before the Court on 11.9.2006, and the Court, in absence of appellant, allowed the respondent to deposit the zar-e-soim by 16.9.2006. This extension in time allowing the respondent to deposit zar-e-soim beyond the period of 30 days led the appellant to file an application under Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. read with section 24(1)(2) of the Act, 1991 seeking dismissal of the suit on account of the respondent's failure to deposit the zar-e-soim within the statutory period of 30 days. The application did not find favour with the learned trial Court and was rejected vide order dated 18.6.2007 on the ground that the controversy regarding depositing of zar-e-soim could be settled by framing of an issue in this behalf. The appellant, being aggrieved of the said order, filed civil revision before the Additional District Judge Ferozwala which was accepted vide order dated 23.6.2010, and resultantly the suit of the respondent was dismissed for not depositing the zar-e-soim in accordance with section 24 of the Act, 1991. This time, the respondent impugned the order of the Additional District Judge before the Lahore High Court by invoking its constitutional jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution by filing a writ petition, which after hearing the parties was accepted through the impugned order dated 11.7.2011 whereby the suit of the respondent was restored and remanded to trial Court for its decision on merit strictly in accordance with law.
3.
 On 13.9.2012, leave was granted by this Court to examine as to whether the Lahore High Court had failed to appreciate the mandate radiating from the words used in section 24 of the Act, 1991, and has remanded the case back, which is not only against the express provisions of the statute, but also, the dicta of this Court.
4.
 Learned counsel for the appellant in this background contended that the period of 30 days as provided in section 24 of the Act, 1991 for the deposit of zar-e-soim is to be reckoned from the date of filing the suit which in the instant case was 11.8.2006 and under no circumstances such period of 30 days could be extended by the Court. On the contrary, subsection (2) of section 24 requires the Court to dismiss the suit on failure of such deposit. Per counsel, in the instant case, the suit was filed on 11.8.2006 and the period of 30 days provided under the law for deposit of zar-e-soim expired on 11.9.2006 and, therefore, the Court had no jurisdiction to extend the time for deposit of such amount beyond 11.9.2006 i.e. upto 16th September, 2006. On the contrary, suit of the respondent ought to have been dismissed in terms of subsection (2) of section 24 of the Act, 1991. In support of his contention that the Court, under no circumstances, had the discretion to allow the deposit of zar-e-soim beyond the period of 30 days from the filing of the suit, learned ASC has placed reliance on the judgment of this Court, in the case titled Hasnain Nawaz Khan v. Ghulam Akbar (PLD 2013 SC 489).
5.
 On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent, without disputing the fact as pleaded, contended that the period of 30 days as provided under the first proviso of section 24 of the Act, 1991 for deposit of zar-e-soim is to be reckoned from the date the suit is formally registered by the Court and/or when the order of such deposit is made and in the instant case the suit was registered on 2.9.2006 by directing the respondent to deposit zar-e-soim by 11.9.2006 and, therefore, the period of 30 days was to expire on 2.10.2006. The Court, therefore, had exercised its discretion to extend the time for deposit of zar-e-soim within the stipulated time period of 30 days as provided under the law. In support of his contention that the period of 30 days is to be reckoned from the date the Court directs such deposit, reliance has been placed on the order of this Court in the case titled as Raja v. Tanveer Riaz (PLD 2014 SC 466) and to plead that the Court had the discretion to extend the time, reliance has been placed on the judgment of this Court in the case titled Muhammad Ramzan v. Muhammad Bakhsh (PLD 2012 SC 764).
6.
 We have heard the contentions of learned counsel for the parties and have perused the record.
7.
 Since the controversy revolves around the interpretation of section 24 of the Act 1991, therefore, in order to reach at a just and fair conclusion, it would be beneficial to reproduce the said section which reads as follows:-
""24. Plaintiff to deposit sale price of the property. (1) In every suit for pre-emption the Court shall require the plaintiff to deposit in such Court one-third of the sale price of the property in cash within such period as the Court may fix:
Provided that such period shall not extend beyond thirty days of the filing of the suit:
Provided further that if no sale price is mentioned in the sale-deed or in the mutation, or the price so mentioned appears to be inflated, the Court shall require deposit of one-third of the probable value of the property.
(2) Where the plaintiff fails to make a deposit under subsection (1) within the period fixed by the Court or withdraws the sum so deposited by him, his suit shall be dismissed.
(3) Every sum deposited under subsection (1) shall be available for the discharge of costs.
(4) The probable value fixed under subsection (1) shall not affect the final determination of the price payable by the pre-emptor.
8.
 A bare perusal of section ibid leaves no doubt in our mind that the Court is bound to require the pre-emptor to deposit one-third of the sale price (zar-e-soim) of the property sought to be pre-empted within a period left to the discretion of the Court. However, through first proviso of the section ibid such discretion is circumscribed/restricted by a maximum of 30 days from the date of filing of the suit meaning thereby that the Court may require the pre-emptor to deposit the zar-e-soim within a period ranging from one day to thirty days but under no circumstances the Court is left with any power/discretion to allow the pre-emptor to make deposit of the zar-e-soim beyond the period of 30 days. The first proviso places a specific embargo/restriction on the powers of the Court from extending the time for deposit of zar-e-soim beyond the period of 30 days to be reckoned from the date of filing the suit beside subsection (2) provides penal consequence for not depositing the zar-e-soim within a period of 30 days by dismissal of the pre-emptor suit. This is the settled law and has been reiterated time and again by this Court in its number of pronouncements, reference can readily be made to the cases of Muhammad Ramzan v. Muhammad Bakhsh (PLD 2012 SC 764), Hasnain Nawaz Khan v. Ghulam Akbar (PLD 2013 SC 489) and Raja v. Tanveer Riaz (PLD 2014 SC 466).
9.
 As to the contention that the time in accordance with the first proviso would commence from the day the suit is formally admitted by the Court and not from the date of presenting/filing the suit and/or the date when a formal order directing the pre-emptor to deposit zar-e-soim is passed. A bare perusal of first proviso reflects that the time for deposit of zar-e-soim shall not extend beyond 30 days of the filing of the suit. The term ""filing of the suit"" has not been defined in the Act of 1991 itself and to hold that ""filing of suit"" would be the day when the presiding officer after removal of all office objections directs formal registration of suit by entering it in the institution register would be against the very purposes of the Act 1991. One has to keep in mind that the purpose of section 24 of the Act 1991 is to protect the vendee from frivolous litigation and also to ascertain the capacity of the intending pre-emptor to purchase the property sought to be pre-empted at the time when the property was being sold. Keeping in mind the purpose of such deposit, to say that period for depositing zar-e-soim would commence from the date of registration of suit would allow the pre-emptor to prolong the foreseeable deposit of zar-e-soim by keeping his suit pending in objection which to our mind would frustrate the very purpose of the first proviso. Even otherwise, the term ""file"" per black law dictionary means; to deliver a legal document to the Court clerk or record custodian for placement in the official record. Likewise Rule 1(1) of Order IV, C.P.C. provides that ""every suit shall be instituted by presenting a plaint to the Court or such officer as it appoints in this behalf"". Additionally the explanation of section 3 of the Limitation Act also provides that ""a suit is instituted, in ordinary cases when the plaint is presented to the proper officer"" and, therefore, in our opinion once the presentation of plaint is accepted by the Court or the officer so appointed by the Court, it would be the date of filing the suit for the purpose of first proviso and the period of 30 days would be reckoned from that day.
10.
 As to the second limb of the submission i.e. when the suit after filing is not formally placed in Court for orders or when there is an omission on the part of the Court (like in the instant case) in timely directing the pre-emptor to deposit the zar-e-soim and the pre-emptor takes shelter of subsection (1) which subjects the deposit under the order of the Court, by taking a defence that since there was no order of the Court directing deposit of zar-e-soim, therefore, pre-emptor could not be penalized by invoking the provisions of subsection (2) which provides dismissal of suit on account of non-deposit of zar-e-soim within a maximum period of 30 days. Though a pre-emptor in view of subsection (1) must be ready and have in his pocket the required amount of zar-e-soim at the time of filing of suit and to show his bona fide should ensure that the order for deposit of zar-e-soim is promptly passed so its compliance be effected in terms of the first proviso. However, since the required deposit is subject to the order of the Court, therefore, in cases where Court omits to pass order or the matter is not placed in Court within the time frame as provided in the first proviso then the pre-emptor cannot be blamed and penalized for such non-deposit as the deposit of zar-e-soim is subject to the order of the Court and this Court in such circumstances by upholding the principle that an act of Court shall prejudice no man, has condoned such default. Reference can be made to the case of Nabi Ahmed v. Muhammad Arshad (2008 SCMR 1685). However, in such cases upon realizing its mistake the Court while granting time for payment of zar-e-soim would not be exercising power under the first proviso which empowers the Court to grant any period of time upto 30 days in one go or by extending the period from time to time upto the maximum of 30 days but would remedy its fault under the age old principle ""Actus curiae neminem gravabit"" i.e. an act of the Court shall prejudice no man, therefore, once a reasonable time is granted for deposit of zar-e-soim to remedy its mistake, the Court shall have no power to extend and grant further time. Even otherwise, time for deposit of zar-e-soim is not granted to the pre-emptor to generate fund from his resources as the pre-emptor must have in his pocket one-third of the sale price of the property sought to be pre-empted while approaching the Court.
11.
 In the instant case, the plaint was presented on 11.8.2006 and since the pre-emptor was seeking interim relief, therefore, the case on that very day was presented before the presiding officer who directed issuance of notices to the defendant for 2.9.2006, however, somehow the other omitted to pass an order directing the pre-emptor to deposit the zar-e-soim. It appears that the suit was formally registered on 2.9.2006 when it was fixed in Court for hearing. The Court upon realizing its mistake of not passing an order for depositing the zar-e-soim on the first date of hearing directed the deposit of zar-e-soim by 11.9.2006 i.e. exactly within the unexpired period of 30 days from the date of filing of the suit. It appears that the respondent on 7.9.2006 two days before the expiry of statutory period of 30 days moved an application seeking extension in time at his own risk for the deposit of zar-e-soim which application was placed in Court on 11.9.2006 and in the absence of appellant/vendee the Court extended the time for deposit till 16.9.2006. This extension of time for deposit of zar-e-soim after the expiry of statutory period of 30 days in the circumstances could not be sustained.
12.
 These are the reasons for the short order of even date whereby we, by allowing this appeal, had dismissed the suit.

64,"ABDUL WASAY Versus State","June 5, 2017","QUETTA HIGH COURT BALOCHISTAN"," Honorable Justice Abdullah Baloch ","2017 MLD 1778","JUDGMENT
 ABDULLAH BALOCH, J.---
This common judgment disposes of Criminal Appeal No.107/2014, Murder Reference No.03/2014 and Criminal Acquittal Appeal No.122/2014, against the judgment dated 18th April 2014 (hereinafter referred as, ""the impugned judgment"") passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge Killah Abdullah at Chaman (hereinafter referred as, ""the trial Court""), whereby the appellant Abdul Wasay Son of Abdul Baqi, was convicted under section 302 subsection (b) Q&D and sentenced to death as Tazir and he was directed to be hanged by his neck till he is dead. The appellant has also been directed to pay Rs.200,000/- (Rupees Two Hundred Thousand) as compensation to the legal heirs of deceased as envisaged under section 544-A, Cr.P.C. and in default thereof to further suffer one (01) year S.I. Whereas, the accused Abdul Hadi son of Abdul Baqi, Abdul Rashid son of Abdul Ghani and Syed Ali son of Abdul Hakeem were acquitted of the charge.
2.
 Facts of the case are that on 18th May, 2012 the complainant Abdul Shakoor son of Khard lodged FIR No.22/2012, under Sections 302, 337-ADF Q&D Ordinance R/W Sections 147, 148, 149, P.P.C., stating therein that on the day of occurrence he along with his brother Abdul Wadood were going to Bazar for buying household articles and when they reached near Adda Kahol Levies Check Post, the accused Abdul Wasay and other started quarreling with them, resultantly he received simple injures, hence he was being shifted to hospital by his brother Abdul Wadood and son Najeebullah, but when they reached near main gate of Civil Hospital Chaman, suddenly at about 08.00 a.m. accused Abdul Wasay, Abdul Hadi both sons of Haji Abdul Baqi, Abdul Rasheed son of Abdul Ghani and Syed Ali sons of Abdul Hakeem, attacked upon them. It is averred in the FIR that the accused Abdul Wasay was equipped with knife, who repeatedly inflicted knife blows upon his son Najeebullah, due to which he died at the spot, while accused Abdul Rasheed equipped with knife attacked upon his brother and repeatedly inflicted knife blows to his brother, due to which he sustained injures, while accused Syed Ali and Abdul Hadi beaten him with kicks and fists. The motive behind the occurrence is stated to be a landed dispute.
3.
 In pursuance of the above FIR, the investigation of the case was entrusted to PW-7 Muhammad Aslam, IP/IO, who during investigation received the documents regarding inquest report under section 174, Cr.P.C., took into possession the crime weapons i.e. a knife and a dagger shaped knife from Amir Peter, IP/SHO, who had snatched the same from the accused soon after commission of crime; obtained death certificate of deceased and medical certificates of injured, inspected the site and prepared site map; arrested the accused; recorded the statements of witnesses under Section 161, Cr.P.C.; took into possession blood stained cloths of deceased and sent the same to FSL and received the FSL report in affirmative; obtained the Copy of FIR No.84/2012 already registered against the accused at Levies Thana Chaman; on completion of investigation submitted the challan, while on receipt of FSL report submitted the same through complete challan.
4.
 At the trial, the prosecution produced seven (07) witnesses, whereafter all the accused were examined under Section 342, Cr.P.C. They also recorded their statements on oath under Section 340(2), Cr.P.C. and produced three witnesses in their defence. On conclusion of the trial and hearing arguments, the learned trial Court convicted the appellant Abdul Wasay and sentenced him to death as Tazir, while the accused Abdul Hadi son of Abdul Baqi, Abdul Rashid son of Abdul Ghani and Syed Ali son of Abdul Hakeem, were acquitted of the charge. Whereafter, the appellant Abdul Wasay filed Criminal Appeal No.107 of 2013, while Murder Reference No.03/2014 has been forwarded by learned trial Court for confirmation of death sentence or otherwise, while the complainant Abdul Shakoor filed Criminal Acquittal Appeal No.122/2014 against the acquittal of accused Abdul Hadi son of Abdul Baqi, Abdul Rashid son of Abdul Ghani and Syed Ali son of Abdul Hakeem.
5.
 Learned counsel for the convict-appellant Abdul Wasay contended that all the prosecution witnesses made contradictory statements and dishonest improvements in their depositions before the Court, due to which their testimony is not reliable to base conviction as sufficient doubts have been created in the case of prosecution, hence the case of appellant is on the same footings to that of acquitted accused, but the benefit of such doubts were not extended in favour of convict-appellant, resulting miscarriage of justice; that the prosecution has only produced the evidence of interested and related witnesses; that the ocular account of testimony is in conflict with medical evidence; that the prosecution has also failed to establish the recovery of crime weapon from the exclusive possession of the appellant rather the same was foisted upon him by the police just to give strength to the case of prosecution; that the defence so taken and establish through independent witnesses was discarded by the learned trial Court while delivering the impugned judgment; that there are sufficient mitigating circumstances in the case in hand, thus awarding death sentence to the convict-appellant is unwarranted under the law and is very harsh.
6.
 To the extent of acquitted accused-respondents, it has been argued by the learned counsel that after proper appreciation of evidence, the learned trial Court has come to just and right decision by acquitting them; that double presumption of innocence is attached to the case of acquittal and interference is unwarranted until and unless it is established that the impugned order of acquittal is perverse and contrary to the record, but perusal of impugned judgment to the extent of acquitted accused it is evident that the same has been delivered in accordance with law.
7.
 Learned Deputy Prosecutor General assisted by learned counsel for complainant while supporting the impugned judgment to the extent of convict-appellant stated that trial Court has delivered a well-reasoned judgment by discussing each and every aspect of the case to the extent of convict-appellant, but it has failed to properly appreciate the same to the extent of acquitted accused; that the prosecution has not only produced direct, consistent confidence inspiring and solid evidence against the convict-appellant, but also to the extent of acquitted accused, but wrongly the same were discarded to the extent of acquitted accused, hence the impugned judgment is required to be maintained to the extent of convict-appellant and also the accused-respondents are entitled to be convicted and sentenced in accordance with law; that the statements of PWs are not suffering from material contradictions, infirmities or dishonest improvements; that there are no mitigating circumstances to award lesser punishment to the convict-appellant and that after proper appraisal of the evidence available on record the trial Court has rightly awarded penalty of death to the appellant, which is not open for any interference.
8.
 Heard the learned counsel and perused the available record. Perusal of record reveals that the unnatural death of deceased Najeeb Ullah is not disputed. Even the defence has admitted the unnatural death of deceased, but pleaded false implication. The admitted feature of the case is that the occurrence took place at about 8.00 a.m. in the main gate of Civil Hospital Chaman, where the deceased along with his uncle Abdul Wadood had brought his injured father to hospital, who had received injuries in the earlier incident that had been taken place at about 7.20 a.m. Since, the instant incident took place in front of main gate of Civil Hospital Chaman, thus immediately the deceased was taken inside the hospital, where at about 8.20, a.m. he was examined by PW-6 Dr. Rafiullah, Medical Officer and he issued MLC Ex.P/6, perusal of which suggests multiple major incised wounds on different parts of body of deceased especially on his chest and on left femur and on left tibia. The inquest report Ex.P/7-B also suggests multiple injuries on the person of deceased. The FSL report Ex.P/7-E also confirms that the waistcoat and Chaddar of deceased were stained with human blood.
9.
 Now adverting to ocular testimony, the prosecution has produced seven witnesses. The FIR was lodged on the basis of fard-e-bayan Ex.P/1-A of PW-1 Abdul Shakoor, who in his statement reiterated the contents of fard-e-bayan correctly, PW-1 stated hat on the day of occurrence at about 18th May 2012 he along with his brother Abdul Wadood were going to Bazar when informed near Levies Thana by convict-appellant Abdul Wasay and his accomplices and started quarrelling with them, due to which he received simple injuries, thus was shifted to Civil Hospital Chaman when on the main gate of hospital, the accused once again reached there and attacked upon the complainant and others. PW-1 categorically stated that the convict-appellant Abdul Wasay was equipped with knife and he inflicted repeated knife blows to his son Najeeb Ullah, while the accused Abdul Rasheed attacked upon him and his brother Abdul Wadood. PW-1 further deposed that there exists a landed dispute in between the parties. PW-1 also confirms the arrival of police soon after the occurrence. The statement of PW-1 has fully been supported and corroborated by PW-2 Abdul Wadood, who recorded his statement in line to the statement of PW-1. PW-2 narrated the story with regard to their departure from their house towards Bazar and launching attack upon them by accused party near Levies Thana and subsequently the second attack in front of Civil Hospital Chaman. PW-2 has given a specific role of equipping of the convict-appellant Abdul Wasay with knife and inflicting repeated blows to his nephew Najeeb Ullah deceased. PW-2 confirms the arrival of police and arresting the culprits from the spot. PW-3 Abdul Muhammad is also the alleged eye-witness of the occurrence, who in his statement stated that at about 8.00 a.m. he was present in Barech Road, when received information about the occurrence, thus rushed towards Civil Hospital and found the accused party beating PW-1, PW-2 and the deceased Najeeb Ullah. PW-3 further ascribed a specific role to convict-appellant Abdul Wasay that he inflicted knife blows upon the deceased.
10.
 We have scrutinized the statements of all the three eye-witnesses of the occurrence with case. The evidence of PW-1 and PW-2 are at different footings from the statements of PW-3. Though we have noticed some minor improvements in the statements of PW-1 and PW-2, but despite such fact their testimonies are reliable, having weight and can be considered as worth credence. Both the witnesses in identical manner narrated the story of their departure from the house, their interception by the accused near Levies Thana and second attack launched against them in front of main gate of Civil Hospital Chaman. Both the witnesses have attributed specific role to the convict-appellant Abdul Wasay being equipped with knife and inflicting repeated knife blows upon the person of deceased Najeeb Ullah, due to which the deceased died at the spot. Both the witnesses remained firm in their deposition with regard to date, time, place of occurrence and the manner in which repeated occurrence had taken place. Both the witnesses were cross-examined at sufficient length, but nothing advantageous has come on record giving serious dent to the case of prosecution and overall the defence has failed to shake their testimony. The learned counsel for the appellant emphasized upon such minor improvements in the statements of PW-1 and PW-2 and made an unsuccessful attempt to discredit the case of prosecution, but in our view, those are not substantive enough to justify or create reasonable doubt in the case of prosecution about the involvement and guilt of the appellant, when otherwise both the parties are residing in the same vicinity and already having civil and criminal disputes with each other and they also knew each other prior to the incident, thus mistaken identity of the convict-appellant with the real culprits is ruled out of consideration. Besides, it does not appealable to the logic that the PW-1 being father and PW-2 being uncle may substitute convict-appellant with the real culprits, who have mercilessly inflicted knife blows upon the person of deceased till he is dead. Though the witnesses are related to the deceased being his father and uncle, but mere relationship of the witnesses inter se with the deceased is not enough to term them to be interested witnesses, because the presence of both the witnesses at the time and the place of occurrence is natural as due to earlier altercation PW-1 was taken to hospital for his medical treatment. Hence, the prosecution has successfully established the presence of both the witnesses at the spot and witnessing the crime. 
11.
 We have taken into consideration the statement of PW-3 into juxtaposition with the statements of PW-1 and PW-2 and observed that the presence of PW-3 and witnessing the crime at the time and place of occurrence is entirely different. The Investigating Officer has recorded his statement under Section 161, Cr.P.C. on 22nd May 2012 i.e. on the fifth day of occurrence. The statements of PW-1, PW-2 as well as the contents of fard-e-bayan are completely silent with regard to presence of PW-3 at the place of occurrence. During cross-examination PW-3 could not stand on his own legs and the defence has succeeded in shaking his testimony and the learned trial Court has rightly disbelieved his statement, because in presence of the evidence of direct and natural witnesses, the testimony of PW-3 being chance witness is not helpful to the case of prosecution. So, excluding the testimony of PW-3 Abdul Muhammad, which can be discarded as that of a chance witness, the evidence of two other eye-witnesses does not suffer from any legal infirmity, including that of interestedness. In this regard, we have placed reliance upon the case of Irshad alias Shada v. The State, 1992 PCr.LJ 2273, relevant portion is reproduced herein under:--
""There is no force in this argument as well. Mere relationship of a witness with a party does not render him as an interested witness. He becomes interested witness only if he, besides being related to the party producing him, is also inimical with the opposite party and that too when his evidence does not inspire confidence. In the instant case, no doubt Mst. Rehmat Bibi (P.W.8) being the mother of the deceased, Mst. Seeman (P.W.9) being her maternal-niece and Bashir Ahmad (P. W.10) being her brother-in-law, were closely related witnesses but they cannot be dubbed as ""interested witnesses"" because they had no previous animosity with the opposite-party. So, excepting the testimony of Bashir Ahmad (P. W.10), which can be discarded as that of a chance witness, the evidence of two other eye-witnesses does not suffer from any legal infirmity, including that of interestedness.""
12.
 The case of prosecution has further been strengthened due to immediate arrest of the convict-appellant along with crime weapon at the time and the place of occurrence. PW-5 Javed, is the recovery witness of crime weapon i.e. knife, who stated that on the date and time of occurrence he along with SHO was on patrolling duty and when reached near Civil Hospital Chaman, found a crowd of people, hence rushed there and arrested the convict-appellant along with the crime weapon, which was taken into possession through recovery memo. The statement of this witnesses is impartial and worth credence as he had no motive or grudge to substitute the real culprit with an innocent within such short-span of time. This also eliminates chances of claim of substitution of the culprit particularly when the death of the deceased in claimed manner i.e. at place of incident with knife, is established and never disputed. We would like to take advantage of the case of Akhter Ali v. State, 2011 SCMR 937, wherein it has been held that, ""...the appellant was apprehended immediately after the occurrence by the P.Ws. who have absolutely no motive to implicate the appellant."" Therefore, the statement of PW-5 has not only corroborated the statements of PW-1 and PW-2, who have shown the presence of convict-appellant at the place and the time of occurrence with crime weapon i.e. knife, but it has corroborated the medical evidence, whereby it has been opined that the deceased was murdered due to injuries inflicted with sharp weapon.
13.
 The re-appraisal of entire prosecution evidence has established the presence and participation of the convict-appellant along with the crime weapon and causing the murder of deceased with sharp weapon coupled with the fact that the appellant was caught red-handed soon after the occurrence and recovery of crime weapon was also effected from his possession and more particularly at the place of occurrence. The convict- appellant while recording his statement on oath under section 340(2), Cr.P.C. has also admitted his arrest from the place of occurrence by the police. The fact remains is that the police had no previous enmity with the convict-appellant to falsely implicate him in the crime, when otherwise the convict-appellant was nominated in the FIR registered promptly. Hence, the prosecution has successfully established the charge against the convict-appellant beyond the shadow of reasonable doubt.
14.
 Now adverting to the Crl. Acquittal Appeal No.122 of 2014 field by the appellant-complainant Abdul Shakoor against the acquittal of accused-respondents Abdul Hadi, Abdul Rashid and Syed Ali, suffice to observe here that complainant-appellant in his fard-e-bayan and Court statement has leveled specific allegations of assaulting him by the accused Abdul Rashid with knife, while beating him and his brother Abdul Wadood by the remaining accused with kicks and fists and according to the case of prosecution they were also examined by the doctor, but perusal of record reveals that the prosecution has failed to produce the evidence of any medical officer that had examined the complainant and his brother. The exhibit of MLC through the Investigating Officer in the Court has no legal and lawful value, unless the concerned Medical Officer is produced and recorded his statement and his statement is tested through cross examination. It has further come on record that two incidents within the intervening period of few minutes were taken place and in the first incident about seventeen accused persons attacked upon the complainant and his brother, due to which they sustained injured and FIR No.84/2012 was lodged at Levies Station Chaman. However, the fact remains is that prior to registering the FIR and medically examining the injured, the second incident had taken place, hence under the circumstances it is very difficult to ascertain that in which incident they had received injuries. Though the prosecution has established the presence of accused-respondents at the time and the place of occurrence, but mere presence of accused-respondents is not enough to establish the charge, hence rightly the trial Court has discarded the evidence to the extent of accused-respondents and has come to a right and just conclusion by acquitting the accused-respondents. The learned counsel for the appellant in Acquittal Appeal No.122/2014 has failed to point out any illegality or irregularity in the impugned judgment of trial Court. Hence, the impugned judgment to the extent of acquittal of accused-respondents being well reasoned is not open for interference by this Court.
15.
 As regards the sentence of death awarded by the learned trial Court against the convict-appellant Abdul Wasay for the offence of murder is concerned, suffice to observe here that there are mitigating circumstances in the matter, which were ignored by the learned trial Court while passing the impugned judgment that a landed dispute that was culminated into civil and criminal trials were pending in between the parties and after one incident the second incident had taken place. Besides, the accused party has also lodged FIR No.94/2012 under sections 337-A, 147 and 149, P.P.C. against the complainant and others with regard to the incidents of said date of occurrence claiming that the said occurrence had taken place at about 7.00 a.m. i.e. prior to the incident reported in the instant case. Apart from that the co-accused of the appellant, nominated in the FIR have already been acquitted by the trial court and, thus mitigating circumstances could not be ruled out and to be considered towards exercising caution in the matter of the appellant's death sentence.
16.
 For the reasons discussed hereinabove, while upholding the conviction of convict-appellant Abdul Wasay Son of Abdul Baqi, his sentence of death is converted into life imprisonment. Compensation as ordered by trial Court is maintained. Benefit of Section 382-B, Cr.P.C. is also extended to the convict-appellant. Accordingly, the instant appeal is partly allowed. Death reference made by trial Court is answered in negative. The Criminal Acquittal Appeal No.122 of 2014 is accordingly dismissed.

By means of instant application, applicant Anwar Ali seeks transfer of Sessions Case No.716 of 2015 pending before II-Additional District and Sessions Judge, Malir to the Anti-Terrorism Court No.1, Karachi.
2.
 Brief facts of the case are as pleaded in the application are that on 12.6.2014 Inspector Ismail Lashari, SHO Police Station Sachal, picked up applicant's son Anis-ur-Rehman. On receiving information, applicant met with the Inspector above named, who allegedly demanded illegal gratification of Rs.500,000.00 for his release. It is further pleaded that on 19.6.2014 applicant arranged Rs.50,000.00, met with the SHO for release of his son but the SHO misbehaved with him. Subsequently in night time Inspector Ismail Lashari along with other police officials raided complainant's house situated in Ghazi Goth, removed jewelry, etc. Applicant filed application against illegal detention of his son before Sessions Judge, Malir, however, Inspector Ismail Lashari murdered his son, whose dead body applicant received from Edhi Center on 23.6.2014. However, on 23.2.2015 applicant succeeded in registering FIR No.90/2015 under sections 365, 395, 302 and 34, P.P.C. against accused persons including official respondents Nos.2 to 5 at Police Station Sachal. Police after usual investigation submitted report in A class before Incharge Judicial Magistrate IV, Malir, Karachi, who did not concur with the police report, took cognizance vide order dated 29.6.2015 and forwarded the case to the Sessions Court where case was numbered as Sessions Case No.716 of 2015.
3.
 On 22.6.2014 complainant SIP Shaikh Shoaib Ali, SHO Police Station Sohrab Goth lodged FIR No.186/2014 stating therein that on said date during patrolling in the area on a tipoff as to the presence of duly armed terrorists Akbar Zaman, Muhammad Nazeer and others in a locked house in Pioneer Homes, he along with police party reached there. Police broken open the lock and entered the house on which terrorists started firing. As a result of police encounter three unknown armed terrorists were killed while their three accomplices managed to escape. Police shifted the dead bodies in ambulance to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for postmortem. However, as per charge sheet report No.191/2014 submitted in FIR No.186/2014 by Inspector Nusrat Hussain Shaikh, on 23.6.2014 one of the terrorists was identified as Anees son of Anwar Ali Soomro, whose dead body was given to the heirs. The case is pending adjudication before Anti-Terrorism Court No. 1, Karachi.
4.
 On 27.2.2016 an application in Sessions Case No.716 of 2015 was filed, seeking transfer of the Sessions Case to the Anti-Terrorism Court No.1, Karachi, in order to avoid conflicting judgments. However, said application was dismissed by the learned 1st Additional Sessions Judge, Malir vide impugned order dated 12.3.2016.
5.
 Learned counsel for the applicant contended that FIR No.90/2015 registered at Police Station Sachal and FIR No.186/2014 emanated from one episode. He further submitted that such submission fortifies with the fact that applicant's son Anis-ur-Rehman was picked up by Inspector Ismail Lashari, and on failure of the applicant to fulfill his illegitimate demand, said Inspector got him killed in a pre-determined and well planned police encounter within the jurisdiction of Sohrab Goth Police Station. However, fact remains that deceased was picked up on 12.6.2014 and applicant received his dead body from Edhi Center on 22/23.6.2014 while police portraying as one of the terrorists killed him in an encounter. He further submitted that in order to avoid conflicting judgments and over and above for safe administration of justice instant transfer application be allowed. Learned APG adopts arguments submitted by the learned counsel for the applicant.
6.
 Contrarily, Mr. Fayaz Ahmed, counsel for respondents Nos.2 to 5 submitted that instant transfer application merits dismissal as two different FIRs were registered by two different complainants and same depict altogether different story. He further submitted that accused nominated in FIR No.90/2015 cannot be charged for murder of Anis-ur-Rehman as he was killed during an encounter with police for which FIR No.186/2014 was registered. He also submitted that as the offences with which respondents are charged are not scheduled offences, Anti-Terrorism Court lacks jurisdiction in matter.
7.
 I have heard the learned counsel for the parties, APG and minutely perused the material available on record. The series of events reveals that on 12.6.2014 applicant's son Anis-ur-Rehman was picked up by Inspector Ismail Lashari, who allegedly demanded illegal gratification for releasing him. In this regard, applicant on 20.6.2014 has filed an application under section 491, Cr.P.C. before the District and Sessions Judge, Malir and on Court orders raid was conducted at Police Station Sachal for the recovery of Anis-ur-Rehman but he was not found there. However, the Sessions Judge, Malir directed the SHO to appear on 25.6.2014. In the meantime, on 22.6.2014 in an encounter with police party headed by SIP Shaikh Shoaib Ali, three unknown terrorists were killed. Later, on 23.4.2014 one of the terrorists killed in the encounter was identified as Anis-ur-Rehman, and applicant received the dead body of his son. From the record it appears that police version as to alleged encounter was recorded as FIR No.186/2014 at Police Station Sohrab Goth.
8.
 After refusal of local police to register FIR against SHO Police Station Sachal and others, applicant approached the Justice of the Peace/District and Sessions Judge, Malir, under section 22-A, Cr.P.C. but his application was dismissed. Applicant filed Criminal Misc. Application No.221 of 2014 under section 561-A, Cr.P.C., and a learned single Judge of this Court vide order dated 22.7.2014 ordered registration of FIR against accused persons, including Inspector Ismail Lashari, SHO Police Station Sachal. Against said order Inspector Ismail Lashari/respondent No.2 herein filed Criminal Petition No.89-K of 2014, however, on 23.2.2015 FIR No.90/2015 under sections 365, 395, 302, 34, P.P.C. at Police Station Sachal in which respondents Nos.2 to 6, including Inspector Ismail Lashari, were nominated as accused, was registered. The honourable Supreme Court vide order dated 27.2.2015 dismissed the petition and refused leave, inter alia, directing the Senior Investigating Officer (SIO) to hand over police file of FIR No.90/2015 to SSP East for holding/supervising investigation; and SSP Malir to ensure that no harm is caused either to the complainant and his family.
9.
 Despite aforesaid orders passed by the apex Court and during pendency of instant transfer application, on 18.2.2017 applicant/ complainant of FIR No.90/2015 Anwer Ali was allegedly picked up by the Rangers Personnel, however, after making an application (Misc. No.2056/2017) on 20.2.2017 and issuing notice to the concerned quarters, applicant was released.
10.
 In the instant case there are two versions: (1) given by the applicant in FIR No.90/2015 in regard to picking up of his son, demand of illegal gratification by police filing of habeas corpus petition and his subsequent murder at the hands of police; and (2) police version contained in FIR No.186/2014 that there was an encounter with unknown terrorists in which three terrorists were killed while others made their escape good and the dead body of one of the terrorists killed in the encounter lying in Edhi Center, namely, Anis-ur-Rehman, applicant's son was received by his legal heirs. Both cases are cross-cases containing different sets of accused persons while the killing/murder of Anis-ur-Rehman is common.
11.
 From the material available on record it appears that applicant's son was allegedly picked up by police on 12.6.2014 and he on 20.6.2014 filed 491, Cr.P.C. application. During hearing of said application on directions of the District Judge, Malir a raid was conducted at Sachal Police Station for recovery of detenue Anis-ur-Rehman and upon non-recovery the matter was fixed on 25.6.2014 with direction to the SHO to appear in person. In the meanwhile, on 22.6.2014 in an alleged encounter with police of Sohrab Goth Police Station terrorists including said detenue was shown killed and series of FIRs including FIR No.186/2014 were registered. So in case police version is accepted by the Special Court, declaring the detenue Anis-ur-Rehman as one of the terrorists what would be the fate of crime No.90/2015 registered by the applicant in regard to alleged abduction and murder of his son at the hands of Inspector Ismail Lashari, SHO Police Station Sachal and others, therefore, in essence two separate criminal proceedings in respect of murder/killing of deceased Anis-ur-Rehman are pending in two distinct courts. There is no cavil to the proposition that when there are two versions in respect of same occurrence the trial ought to be conducted by one and same Court. In law, the ordinary court cannot try scheduled offences.
12.
 In this context, reliance can be placed on the case of Niaz Ahmed v. Hasrat Mehmood (PLD 2016 Supreme Court 70) wherein it was observed that:-
""3. It has vehemently been argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner had initially lodged an FIR in respect of the incident in question and subsequently, having remained dissatisfied with the investigation of the case by the local police, he had instituted a private complaint regarding the selfsame incident containing identical allegations as leveled in the FIR and, thus, by virtue of the law declared by this Court in many cases the trial court ought to have conducted the trial in the complaint case first and it ought not to have consolidated the complaint case and the challan case for a joint and simultaneous trial. In this regard the learned counsel for the petitioner has placed reliance upon the cases of Nur Elahi v. The State, etc. (PLD 1966 SC 708), Mst. Rasool Bibi v. The State and another (2000 SCMR 641), Syed Muhammad Hussain Shah v. Abdul Hamid and 5 others (1981 SCMR 361) and Muhammad Azam v. Muhammad Iqbal and others (PLD 1984 SC 95). We have attended to the said argument advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioner and have also perused the precedent cases referred to by him in support of such contention. The law is settled by now that if different versions of the same incident are advanced by the rival parties through cross-cases and such different versions contain different sets of accused persons then trial of such cross-cases is to be held simultaneously and side by side and a reference in this respect may be made to the cases of Muhammad Sadiq v. The State and another (PLD 1971 SC 713), Abdul Rehman Bajwa v. Sultan and 9 others (PLD 1981 SC 522), Rashid Ahmed v. Asghar Ali, etc. (PLD 1986 SC 37) and Mst. Rasool Bibi v. The State and another (2000 SCMR 641)........"" (emphasis in italic is mine)
13.
 Perusal of record shows that in FIR No.186/2014 under sections 324, 354, 427, 34, P.P.C. read with section 7 of Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, registered at Police Station Sohrab Goth, the prosecution has cited twelve witnesses in column No.6 of the Charge Sheet dated 21.8.2014 out of which eight prosecution witnesses, namely, (1) PI Nusrat Hussain Shaikh, (2) SIO Pir Asghar Hussain Sarhandi, (3) SIP Nadeem Sarwar, (4) ASI Ghulam Rasool, (5) PC Mairaj Waris, (6) PC Tahir Sultan, (7) PC Mumtaz Ali and (8) MLO Dr. Pervez Anwer Khan are also cited as witnesses in FIR No.90/2015 lodged by the applicant.
14.
 In instant cross-cases in respect of killing/murder of Anis-ur-Rehman, trial in respect of FIR No.186/2014 is pending before Anti-Terrorism Court while for FIR No.90/2015 before 1st Additional District and Sessions Judge. It is almost settled principle of law that Anti-Terrorism Court will have power to try non-scheduled offence only when it is trying scheduled offence i.e. scheduled and non-scheduled offences can be tried together in one and same trial. However, power to try non-scheduled offence will not be available to Anti-Terrorism Courts under Anti-Terrorism Act when it is not trying any scheduled offence. Conversely, an ordinary criminal court cannot take cognizance of an offence mentioned in the Schedule to Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.
15.
 Here, reference to section 526(1), Cr.P.C. would be beneficial. Perusal of this section of the Code provides that High Court may transfer case or itself try it- (1) whenever it is made to appear to the High Court that (a) a fair and impartial inquiry or trial cannot be had in any criminal Court subordinate thereto, or (b) some question of law of unusual difficulty is likely to arise, or (c) a view of the place in or near which any offence has been committed may be required for the satisfactory inquiry into or trial of the same, or (d) that an order under this section will tend to the general convenience of the parties or witnesses, or (e) such an order is expedient for the ends of justice, or is required by any provision of this Cody...."" However, the question of expediency would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case but the paramount consideration for the exercise of power must be to meet the ends of justice. I may also observe that propriety demands that whenever the facts or circumstances permit, cross cases, giving two different versions of the same incident and have two different sets of accused, should be tried by the same Court together as if the two cases giving different versions of same incident are not tried together, there would be serious likelihood of conflict in Judgment.
16.
 Keeping in view the above facts and circumstances and in order to avoid conflicting Judgments, it is expedient for the ends of justice that Sessions Case No.716/2015 culminating from FIR No.90/2015 pending before 1st Additional District and Sessions Judge, Malir is transferred to the Anti-Terrorism Court No.1 where case culminating from FIR No.186/2014 is already pending adjudication. Aforesaid are the reasons of my short order dated 24.4.2017 whereby instant criminal transfer application was allowed.

 ZULFIQAR AHMAD KHAN, J.---
 The instant J.M.A. was filed on 11.04.2012 under section 14(1)(2) of the Arbitration Act, 1940 (""the Act"") for directions to the Arbitrators to file award in this Court.
 Brief facts of the case are that the Applicants, as well as Respondent No.1 are the sons and daughters of Late Rehman Ellahi, who died intestate leaving behind various movable and immovable properties. Since there were a number of properties in the name of deceased, the Applicants and Respondent No.1 mutually agreed to resolve their disputes in respect of their respective shares of inheritance in the movable and immovable properties left behind their deceased through arbitration and for that purpose they jointly signed a Salisnama (Arbitration Agreement) on Stamp Paper of R.100/= dated 03.05.2011 appointing Respondents Nos.2, 3 and 4 as Arbitrators with written undertaking that latters' verdict shall be final and binding on them. Since the contents of the said Salisnama are of vital importance, I reproduce the same hereunder:
 The Arbitral Tribunal, which was comprised of the President, Jamiat Punjabi Sodagran Delhi Mr. Muhammad Saeed Presswala, Mufti Ijaz Ahmed and Mr. Ferozuddin Lodhiana after assuming their jurisdiction under the above mentioned Salisnama proceeded with the arbitration proceedings. In the meanwhile, the Respondent No.1 filed Suit No.1448/2011 against the present Applicants for Partition, Accounts, Declaration and Permanent Injunction before this Court, wherein in para-15 of the plaint, it was disclosed that the Arbitral Tribunal has given its Award, however, the Applicants contend that they did not receive the said Award. Since the arbitration proceedings were duly attended by the present Applicants, they moved application under section 34 of the Act for stay of proceedings in Suit No.1448/2011 and at the same time they filed the instant J.M.A., making a prayer that ""Hon'ble Court may be pleased to direct the Respondents Nos.2 to 4 jointly and/or severally being Arbitral Tribunal to file their award dated 27.07.2011 in this Court for further proceedings as per provisions of the Arbitration Act, 1940.""
 When this JMA was filed, notices were accordingly issued to the Respondents and from the order dated 11.03.2013 it could be noted that the Respondent No.4 filed a statement which was received by this Court on 15.05.2012, with which a copy of the Award dated 27.07.2011 was filed. At this juncture, it is pertinent to mention that the Arbitrators affirmed that the true version of the Award was dated 02.12.2011. Be that as it may the genuineness of the Award is not challenged. It seems that subsequent of the Arbitral Award being filed in the Court on 15.05.2012, the Applicants filed objections thereto on 13.05.2013 and requested that the Award be remitted to the Arbitrators. This Court vide order dated 02.03.2015 notwithstanding that the objections were filed after the expiry of the period of limitation of 30 days provided under Article 158 of the Limitation Act, 1908, ordered for remittal of the award to the Arbitrators. In the meantime, the counsel for the Applicants moved application being CMA No.3244/2016 under section 28 of the Act, in terms of which extension of time of four months was sought for the submission of the Award, which application was granted through order dated 29.02.2016, subsequent thereto, the counsel for the Applicants filed an application being CMA No.994/2017 on 23.01.2017 under section 41 of the Act, praying to restrain Respondent No.1 from selling or disposing etc. of the properties left behind by their deceased father Rehman Ellahi and their deceased mother Mst. Nasreen Rehman. Through another application made under sections 5, 8 and 89 of the Act being CMA No.995/2017, the Applicants named two individuals to replace the Arbitrators being Respondents Nos.2 and 3 on the contention that the current Respondents have refused to re-adjudicate the matter. When this application came up to this Court on 21.02.2017, a preliminary question was posed as to the very maintainability of these applications and the learned counsel for the Applicants sought time to assist this Court. After hearing the instant JMA, this Court on 07.03.2017 passed the following orders:
""Heard the counsel for the applicants at length, who very eloquently described the mechanism and scheme provided by the Arbitration Act, 1940 and advised under what circumstances, provisions of this Act operate to assist parties who prefer to settle their disputes by the alternate mode of arbitration rather resorting to court proceedings.
It was pointed out that under Section 3 of the said Act, a mechanism has been built where arbitration could be achieved without the intervention of the Court. While responding to the question, that when agreement does not contain ""arbitration shall be governed by..."" proper law provision, and the intention of the parties (as in the instant case is evident) is that matter be arbitrated without court's intervention (page 17), how the present request for the substitution of arbitrators is maintainable when the Award has already been given? The learned counsel made reference to First Schedule which, per counsel, is applicable to such agreements which fail to specify intentions.
This contention does not seem to be well founded as the very intention of Section 3 is to keep the matters away from Court and have them arbitrated without court's intervention. Rather of specific importance is provision 7 of the First Schedule which clearly states that ""The award shall be final and binding on the parties and persons claiming under them respectively."" Meaning thereby leaving no room for Courts to interfere with such awards unless the conditions specified in Section 16 are satisfied, which is beyond the scope of the prayers made.
Counsel seeks time to assist this Court as to how the instant J.M. (where the sole prayer is that Arbitrators be directed to file their award dated 27.07.2011) is maintainable when parties not only consented to the name(s) of the Arbitrators, they further agreed that they will completely be abided by each any and every decision of the Arbitrators; and even if any queries are raised, they will be addressed by the parties to the designated Arbitrators alone and that parties will agree to the explanation given by the Arbitrators.""
 The matter was adjourned for 14.03.2017, on which date a brief was held for the learned counsel for the Applicants and the matter was accordingly adjourned to 21.03.2017, even on that date a brief was held for the counsel and the matter eventually was adjourned to 22.03.2017, where for the reasons to be recorded, the instant JMA on account of maintainability was dismissed.
 Before I proceed any further, it would be pertinent to give a brief review of the Act which deals with broadly three kinds arbitration: viz. (1) arbitration without intervention of a court: (2) arbitration with intervention of a court where there is no suit pending and (3) arbitration in suits. Except as provided either by the Act (or any other Act) the Act applies to all arbitrations, including statutory arbitrations. It is worth recollecting that it was through this Act passed on 01.07.1940 an alternate mechanism of dispute settlement was provided which improved upon the earlier law relating to arbitration contained in the Indian Arbitration Act, 1899. But what has been made of it, is left to be answered in the later part of this order.
 Coming back to the facts of the case, it in undisputed that parties had agreed to have their disputes resolved through arbitration without the intervention of court. The parties even did bind themselves that the decision of the arbitrators (as given in the light of Sheria) will be final and not be challenged in the court of law, and in case any explanation is sought, the parties will only revert to the arbitrators. As mentioned earlier, parties fully participated in the deliberation of the Arbitral Tribunal which passed the award, for the supply of a copy of which the instant JMA was initially filed, however by making one application or another, the instant JMA was distorted from its earlier objective to the extent that orders were sought not only for forcing the arbitrators to pass the award afresh, rather in the event when the arbitrators (rightly) refused to re-hear the matter afresh, prayers have been made to substitute the earlier arbitrators with new set of arbitrators with the full intervention of court, an act which at the face of it is contrary to the terms agreed in the Salisnama. On this account, a query was raised for the attention of the learned counsel for the Applicants as to when the parties through Salisnama (Arbitration Agreement) dated 03.05.2011 made a very clear determination that they will be bound by the award given by the Arbitrators including each and every ingredient thereof, coupled with the fact they agreed that the decision of the Arbitrators would not be challenged in the Court of law, as well as, if there was any need for explanation, such explanation will only be sought through the earlier selected Arbitrators and the parties further agreed that the explanation given by those Arbitrators would be accepted as final by the parties. Having given such undertaking and made covenants, how the applications moved by the learned counsel of the Applicants where not only the Award has been challenged, rather prayer is made to have the Award remitted and be adjudicated by a new set of Arbitrators are competent?
 The learned counsel in response thereto drew Court's attention to Section 30 of the Act. Full contents of the said section are reproduced hereunder:
""30.
 Grounds for setting aside award
. An award shall not be set aside except on one or more of the following grounds, namely:-
(a)
 that an arbitrator or umpire has misconduct himself or the proceeding ;
(b)
 that an award has been made after the issue of an order by the Court superseding the arbitration or after arbitration proceedings has been invalid, under section 35; and
(c)
 that an award has been improperly procured or is otherwise invalid.""
 It is abundantly clear through a plain reading of the above quoted section that the said section clearly enumerates grounds for setting aside an award. The three conditions as evident from the aforesaid section were discussed at length during the course of the arguments and it was evident that neither condition (a), (b), nor (c) of the above section were satisfied then how the award could have been declared invalid? When this question was posed to the counsel for the Applicant, no satisfactory explanation was forthcoming.
 At this juncture, the attention of the counsel was drawn to Section 16 of the Act, which provides reasoning for the remittal of an award as a part of the Chapter of the Act dealing with Arbitration without intervention of a Court which is more applicable to the case at hand. Full text of Section 16 is reproduced in the following:
16.
 Power to remit award
. (1) The Court may from time to time remit the award or any matter referred to arbitration to the arbitrators or umpire for reconsideration upon such terms as it thinks fit---
(a)
 where the award has left undetermined any of the matters referred to arbitration, or where it determines any matter not referred to arbitration and such matter cannot be separated without affecting the determination of the matters referred; or
(b)
 where the award is so indefinite as to be incapable of execution ; or 
(c)
 where an objection to the legality of the award is apparent upon the face of it.
(d)
 Where an award is remitted under subsection (1) the Court shall fix the time within which the arbitrator or umpire shall submit his decision to the Court:
Provided that any time so fixed may be extended by subsequent order of the Court.
(3)
 An award remitted under subsection (I) shall become void on the failure of the arbitrator or umpire to reconsider it and submit his decision within the time fixed.
 Accordingly, section 16 of the Act was discussed at length and it was agreed that neither clause (a), nor clause (b) is satisfied, whereupon the counsel stated that most likely clause (c) is applicable, which provides that an award could be remitted when an objection to the legality of the award is apparent from the face of it. When the award was read in the four corners of the above referred clauses, no such ground was satisfied. The fact is that section 16 is more appropriately applicable (as compared to section 30) where the intention of the party is to have the award remitted, as in the case at hand parties agreed that the arbitration would be conducted without intervening of the Court, thus provisions of Chapter 2 of the Act would be attracted within which section 16 falls. Having failed to satisfy any of the grounds for remittal of the awards under section 16 of the Act, the attention was focused to section 3 of the Act, which provides that in arbitration agreements, unless a different intention is expressed, the agreements shall be deemed to have been included provisions set out in the First Schedule of the Act. It is therefore now relevant that contents of the First Schedule of the Act be considered which Schedule has 8 clauses, which are reproduced hereunder:
1.
 Unless otherwise expressly provided, the reference shall be to a sole arbitrator.
2.
 If the reference is to an even number of arbitrators, the arbitrators shall appoint an umpire not later than one month from the latest date of their respective appointments.
3.
 The arbitrators shall make their award within four months after entering on the reference or after having been called upon to act by notice in writing from any party to the arbitration agreement or within such extended time as the Court may allow.
4.
 If the arbitrators have allowed their time to expire without making an award or have delivered to any party to the arbitration agreement or to the umpire a notice in writing stating that they cannot agree, the umpire shall forthwith enter on the reference in lieu of the arbitrators.
5.
 The umpire shall make his award within two months of entering on the reference or within such extended time as the Court may allow.
6.
 The parties to the reference and all persons claiming under them shall subject to the provisions of any law for the time being in force, submit to be examined by the arbitrators or umpire on oath or affirmation in relation to the matters in difference and shall, subject as aforesaid, produce before the arbitrators or umpire all books, deeds, papers, accounts, writings and documents within their possession or power respectively, which may be required or called for, and do all other things which, during the proceedings on the reference, the arbitrators or umpire may require.
7.
 The award shall be final and binding on the parties and persons claiming under them respectively.
8.
 The cost of the reference and award shall be in the discretion of the arbitrators or umpire who may direct to, and by whom, and in what manner, such costs or any part thereof shall be paid, and may tax or settle the amount of costs to be so paid or any part thereof and may award costs to be paid as between legal practitioner and client.
 As it could be seen from the above, the clause 7 requires that all arbitration agreements where the parties agree that arbitration would be conducted without intervention of a Court, they bind themselves that the award as declared would be final and binding on them. With regards finality of an award and its binding force, notwithstanding even that the award had not been made a rule of court, to see the extent of its force while keeping in mind provisions of clause-7, reference could be made to the case of Sathish Kumar and others v. Surinder Kumar and others, reported in AIR 1970 SC 833 where effect of section 14 read with section 3 and clause 7 of the First Schedule were elaborated. Supreme Court held that the award becomes final and binding on the parties as soon as the same is signed by the arbitrator, notwithstanding the fact that it has not been made a rule of the court. The same was a three member bench decision. Two of the Judges wrote one judgment and the third Judge wrote a separate judgment, agreeing with the other two Judges, but adding a few words by his own in support of the judgment of the other two Judges which makes a legal position explicitly clear. It is held thus therein:
HEDGE, J. I agree. But I would like to add few words. Arbitration proceedings, broadly speaking may be divided into two stages. The first stage commences with arbitration agreement and ends with the making of the award. And the second stage relates to the enforcement of the award. Clause 7 of the First Schedule to the Arbitration Act lays down that ""the award shall be final and binding on the parties and persons claiming under them respectively.""
 The learned counsel when posed with this legal challenge placed reliance on 2014 CLC 1519, where Court was pleased to intervene by extending the statutory time limit of four months as stipulated under 3rd clause of the above First Schedule on the ground that the act of the party has given consent to the arbitrator for extension of such term, undoubtedly the said proposition is not existing in the instant case. The case before this Court is once parties have agreed to have their disputes settled through arbitration with affirmation that the award will not be challenged in the Court they have contractually bond themselves with full force of law. Then in those cases, the award can only be remitted under section 16 of the Act (if a case is made for such a remittal) and the arbitrators cannot be changed without mutual consent of the parties, as it would be in violation of the initial arbitration agreement, where the parties agreed that the arbitration conducted by the three individual arbitrators would be final and binding. The learned counsel for the Applicants agitated against the said proposition and contended that it is the right of the parties to object to any award and to have the same re-adjudicated through a new set of arbitrators. When posed with a challenge that how such an act would not be violative of the initial bounding agreement of arbitration, where the parties initially agreed that they wouldn't do so, and at the same time, will not that create a non-conclusive perpetual situation where no award could ever be finalized and enforced since there would always be one party who would prefer to challenge an award and to have it re-arbitrated? The learned counsel could not provide any satisfactory answer to this proposition, as the fact is the above acts have created a sorrow state where nearly all such awards are challenged in Courts. It is exactly on this account that even in cases where parties agree to have speedy disposal of their disputes through arbitration, malicious and ill-conceived applications drag courts to deter the finality of the awards, which mischievous acts have rendered the Arbitration Act to a greater extent almost otiose.
 For the aforesaid reasons, in the case at hand where the parties agreed to have their disputes adjudicated through Salisnama dated 03.05.2011 and they agreed to be bound by the award passed by the arbitrators and not to approach courts even in cases of any explanation, and where an award has already been made by the duly appointed arbitrators and where no case has been made out for the remittal of the award under section 16 and the award becoming a final adjudication by a court of the parties' own choice is conclusive upon the merits of the controversy submitted by the parties, and until unless the parties had intended that the award shall not be final (which is not the case at hand) the award attained all the elements of vitality and is competent to be relied upon in disputes between the parties relating to the same subject-matter, it could not be challenged or re-arbitrated in the manner requested by the Applicants. While the sole prayer seeking the Arbitral Tribunal to file their award dated 27.07.2011 having been met, making the instant JMA infructuous, and the CMAs being dismissed for the reasons specified hereinabove, the instant JMA was dismissed by the short order dated 22.03.2017, and these are the reasons of the said order.

 ZAHEER-UD-DIN KAKAR, J.---
This appeal has been directed against the judgment dated 24.3.2017 ""the impugned judgment"" passed by the Drug Court of Balochistan, Quetta ""the trial Court"", whereby the appellant Muhammad Shafiq was convicted under Section 23(1)(c) of the Drugs Act, 1976 and sentenced to suffer five (5) months Rigorous Imprisonment (RI) with fine of Rs.50,000/- or in default of payment of fine to further undergo Simple Imprisonment (SI) for two months.
2.
 Precisely stated, the facts of the case are that on 05.8.2014 at about 11:50 a.m., the complainant namely Sarwar Khan Kakar, Drug Inspector Quetta Zone-J, inspected the Akbari Medical Store, Metha Chowk, Pashtoonabad, Quetta and found the appellant in illegal dealing of drug (medicine) business without having a Drug Sale License. Resultantly, he took the samples of the seized stock on Form 5 as case property and sealed the said Medical Store.
3.
 On 6.8.2015, the complainant issued a show-cause notice to the appellant in respect of the sale of drugs without a Drug Sale License, but without any reply, as such, sanction for prosecution against the appellant was granted by the Provincial Quality Control Board, Balochistan, Quetta vide letter dated 31.10.2015.
4.
 The trial Court, after taking cognizance, framed a charge and read over to the appellant, to which he pleaded guilty. Notice under Section 243, Cr.P.C. was issued. The appellant, once again admitted his guilt and placed himself at the mercy of the Court and requested to take lenient view. Thus, the trial Court, convicted and sentenced the appellant as mentioned above, hence this appeal.
5.
 At the very outset, the learned counsel for the appellant does not press the appeal on merits and requested for moderate reduction in the quantum of sentence on the ground that the appellant is first offender, not previously convicted and the only bread winner of his family. He further submitted that the appellant will not ask for de-sealing of the medical store without obtaining valid drug sales license.
6.
 On the other hand, the learned State Counsel opposed the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant and stated that the appellant has admitted his guilt, as such, he (appellant) cannot call the judgment impugned in question.
7.
 Heard and perused the record. In this case, admittedly, the appellant had made clear confession thereby admitting that he stocked and sold medical drugs at the Messrs Akbari Medical Store, situated at Mitha Chowk Pashtoonabad without having a drug sale license and declined to produce any evidence. It is a common practice that once a person who is involved in a criminal case wants to plead guilty to the charge leveled against him and placed himself at the mercy of the Court and in that eventuality he become a friend of the Court and the Court always takes lenient view in respect of his sentence. Since the appellant, in the instant case, have straight away placed himself at the mercy of the trial Court and pleaded guilty, therefore, the trial Court has rightly taken a lenient view in respect of his sentence which is neither illegal nor contrary to the punishment provided in section 23(1)(c) of the Drugs Act, 1976. Furthermore, having confessed the guilt, appellant is barred under section 412, Cr.P.C. to challenge his conviction and sentence by filing appeal. He could only challenge the extent or legality of the sentence which he has failed to challenge. There is no reason why after the complaint and appearance in the trial Court, the appellant how remained unaware that if he made statement in the Court in the proceedings it could result in his conviction and sentence on his own plea of guilty. In a similar case reported as Muhammad Saeed v. The Stare {1985 SCMR 1405}, where the accused had confessed his guilt and declined to produce any evidence in defence, Hon'ble Apex Court refused to grant leave to appeal. Relevant para of the said judgment is reproduced herein below:--
""Not only the petitioner pleaded guilty he also admitted that the drug recovered from him was substandard and declined to produce any evidence. There is no reason why after the complaint and his appearance in the Drug Court he should remain unaware that he was making a statement in Court in proceedings which may result in his conviction and sentence. This being a case of conviction and sentence on his own plea of guilty, no interference is called for and hence leave to appeal is refused.""
8.
 This being case of conviction and sentence on his own plea guilty, no interference is called for. Resultantly, the appeal is dismissed.

However, 17 ex-bond GD Nos.(I) KPQI-EB1223 dated (2) KPQI-EB-1225 dated 07.04.2015, (3) KPQIEB-1224 dated 07-04.2015, (4) KPQI-EB-1274 dated 23.04.2015 (5) KPQI-EB-1275 dated 23.4.2015 (6) KPQI-EB 1404 dated 23.05.2015 (7) KPQI-EB-1445 dated 30.05.2015, (8) KPQI-EB-1505 dated (9) KPQI-EB-1506 dated 05.06.2015, (10) KPQI-EB-1538 dated 15.06.2015, (11) KPQI-EB-1559 dated 24.09.2015, (12) KPQIEB-11 dated 06.07.2015, (13 ) KPQI-EB-12 dated 06.07.2015, (14) KPQI-EB-13 dated 06.07.2015, (15) KPQI-EB-104 dated (16) KPQI-EB-105 dated 12.08.2015 and (17) KPQl-EB-154 dated 03.09.2015 were filed for the clearance of the consignment. The declared value of the consignment was @ US$ 715/MT which was not accepted by the Customs and the goods were released provisionally under section 81 of the Customs Act, 1969, securing differential amount of duty and taxes in shape of 17 Pay Orders submitted by the appellant during the period 07.04.2015 to 03.09.2015 respectively. That the impugned letter/ order dated 23.06.2016 issued by the Assistant Collector, Collectorate of Customs Port Muhammad Bin Qasim, Karachi is without considering the requirements of section 81 of the Customs Act, 1969.
3.
 The case was adjudicated by the learned Assistant Collector of Customs, MCC, Port Muhammad Bin Qasim, Karachi vide Order-in-Original No.SI/Misc/EB/UT/231/2015(PQ) bulk dated 29.06.2016 against the Respondent party.
4.
 On appeal filed by the Respondent party against the above Order-in-Original, the Collector of Customs (Appeals), Karachi vide Order-IN-Appeal No.1064/2016 dated 05.10.2016, passed the following order:--
""1 have examined the case record. The Act of the matter is that the goods were assessed under section 80 of the Customs Act, 1969, the declared transaction value was accepted and the goods were allowed in bonding against various CD's during March 2015. There was no dispute regarding the customs value at the time of in-bonding, therefore assessment stood completed and goods were removed from customs area. When the appellant filed ex-bond goods declaration, the respondents un-authorisedly reopened past and closed transaction and challenged the customs value and processed the goods declaration at a higher value, and upon resistance of the appellant, invoked section 81 of the Customs Act, 1969 and secured pay orders for the additional amount. This action was taken in cases of 17 ex-bond CD's dated April to September, 2015. The respondents made further mockery of law by encashing all the pay orders without issuing any order under section 81(5) of the Customs Act, 1969, within the stipulated period. In essence, the appellants have resorted to amendment of goods declaration, whereas they were specifically debarred to do so. The provisions regarding amendment of GD are examined here under:--
29. Restriction on amendment of [goods declaration].---
Except as provided in section 88, no amendment of [goods declaration] relating to goods assessed for duty on the declared value, quantity or description thereof shall be allowed after such goods have been removed from the customs-area [or assigned a Customs Reference Number electronically, as the case may be].
Amendment under this section is not admissible as the goods were assessed on the declared description and value and that the goods have already been removed from custom area. The custom area as defined under section 2(i) of the Act does not include a warehouse licensed under section 12 ibid.
88. Receipt of goods at warehouse
.---(1) On receipt of the goods, the pass shall be examined by the warehouse-keeper, and shall be returned to the appropriate officer.
(2) No package, butt, cask or other container shall be admitted into any warehouse unless it bears the marks and numbers specified in, and otherwise corresponds with, the pass for its admission.
(3) If the goods be found to correspond with the pass, the warehouse-keeper shall certify to that effect on the pass, and the warehousing of such goods shall be deemed to have been completed.
(4) If the goods do not so correspond, the fact shall be reported by the warehouse-keeper for the orders of the appropriate officer, and the goods shall either be returned to the custom-house in charge of an officer of customs or kept in deposit pending such orders as the warehouse-keeper deems most convenient.
(5) If the quantity or value of any goods has been incorrectly stated in the [goods declaration], due to inadvertence or bona fide error, the error may be rectified at any time before the warehousing of the goods is completed, and not subsequently.
There was no discrepancy found or reported at the time of in-bonding. This provision allows rectification of bona fide error or inadvertent mistake before warehousing of the goods is completed and not subsequently. Therefore amendment under this section is also not possible.
205. Amendment of documents.-
 Except in the case provided for by sections 29, 45, 53 and 88, an officer of customs not below the rank of an [Assistant Collector] of Customs may, in his discretion, upon payment of a fee of [one hundred] rupees, authorise any document, after it has been presented at the custom-house to be amended.
This provision deals with cases which are not covered under sections 29 and 88. In view of the express bar under the previous sections, amendment of GD under this section is not permissible.
In view of the above discussion it is evident that the responding Collectorate committed patent illegalities in processing such cases, in their zeal to extort revenue, the assessing staff have dealt the case with high handedness. The assessment of value stood past and closed transaction at the time of inbonding of goods. In terms of section 30 no change except rate of duty (if applicable) could be made at the time of exbonding. The respondents re-opened the assessment without involving section 195 of the Act, changed the same to provisional assessment under section 81 ibid. The respondents in derogation of provisions of section 81 took an adverse action. The proceedings being void ab initio are set aside. The appeal is successful. The supervisory officers are advised to take appropriate action against delinquents for jeopardizing probable revenue and causing harassment to tax payers.""
5.
 Being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the Order-in-Appeal, the Appellant Department filed the instant appeal before this Tribunal on the grounds, which are reproduced as under:-
A.
 That the impugned order is bad in law, wrong on facts, unjust, inequitable, erroneous, harsh and lacks judicial application of mind.
B.
 Regarding Para (B) it is respectfully submitted that at the time of arrival of bulk cargo vessel imported bulk oil is immediately discharged from vessel which is directly pumped from the vessel through pipe lines to off dock oil tanks of bonded ware houses for direct in-bonding without any assessment as vital information such as test report confirming the exact composition, whether fit for human consumption, value and PSQCA conformity certificate are not available at the time of arrival of the vessel. As such no assessment is made at the time of arrival/ In-bonding of bulk oil cargo and Goods Declaration is endorsed to the effect that all aspects shall be checked at the time of ex-bonding of the goods. 
It is further respectfully submitted that assessment of imported Bulk Oil is made in terms of the Board's letter Board's letter No. 1(2)S/Va1/2000 dated 12.11.2003 as per Reuter Price confirmed by Pakistan Vanaspati Manufacturer's Association as on the relevant Contract date. Since at the time of arrival/ in-bonding of cargo on 31.03.2015 such irdormation/(Reutter Price duly endorsed by the, PVMA) was not available, which was subsequently provided on 29.04.2015 as such no assessment could be made at the time of in-bonding of the goods.
It is further respectfully submitted that the Respondent importer himself requested vide letter dated 27.04.2015 for provisional assessment as per contract date January 26, 2015 meaning thereby that they were well aware of the established practice of assessment as per Reuter Price on the date of contract.
C.
 That the learned Collector of Customs Appeal has erred in fact and law to not appreciate that no assessment is made at the time of arrival of goods and ""assessment"" of such class of goods is made upon receipt of the Reuter Price confirmed by Pakistan Vanaspati Manufacturer's Association as on the relevant Contract date which was provided on 29.04.2015. Therefore, the assessment was finalized as per as per Reuter Price confirmed by Pakistan Vanaspati Manufacturer's Association as on the relevant Contract in terms of the Board's letter No. 1 (2)5/Va1/2000 dated 12.11.2003.
D.
 That the learned Collector of Customs Appeal erred in facts to not appreciate that the Pakistan Vanaspati Manufacturer's Association vide letter No. PVMA/1007/Value/2015 dated has confirmed that the Reuter Price of subject goods @ US$ 782/- as on the relevant contract date as confirmed by the PVMA.
E.
 That without prejudice to above and even otherwise, the learned Collector wrongly presumed that the matter was past and closed transaction and cannot be re-opened by the appellant. It is respectfully submitted that under Section 80(3) of the Customs Act, 1969 the department is empowered to reassess the goods at any stage. The goods can be re-assessed even after they have been removed from the customs station. The order passed by the learned Collector amounts to put restriction on the power of the appellant which was not done by the legislature. The provision of law is reproduced hereunder for ready reference:
""If during the checking of goods declaration, it is found that any statement in such declaration or document or any information so furnished is not correct in respect of any matter relating to the assessment, the goods shall, without prejudice to any other action which may be taken under this Act, be reassessed to duty, taxes and other charges levied thereon.""
Hence the action taken by the department was correct and in accordance with law.
F.
 That the learned Collector (Appeals) failed to appreciate that the provision of law reproduced herein above is absolute and not conditional. The powers exercised by the respondent under the provision of law reproduced ibid are therefore rightly exercised and no illegality was committed in any manner.
G.
 That the learned Collector failed to appreciate that the encashment of pay orders was done only after the provisional assessment had becohie final and not earlier.
H.
 That the learned Collector failed to appreciate that the concerned officers have performed their duty honestly and diligently and no harassment had been caused to the tax payers.
I.
 That the impugned order cannot be sustained under the law and is illegal.
It is therefore prayed that the Honorable Appellate Tribunal be graciously pleased upheld as under:--
a. to set aside the impugned order of Collector of Customs (Appeals), Karachi dated 05.10.2016 and;
b. upheld that the provisional assessment was rightly finalized under section 81(2) of the Customs Act, 1969 and;
c. Securities submitted by the respondent importer were rightly encashed in favour of government exchequer;
6.
 The Respondent party has submitted counter-objections/para-wise comments on the Memo of Appeal filed by the Appellant Department, which are reproduced as under:-
A.
 Denied, impugned Order-in-Appeal is speaking order just, equitable and within the ambit of law hence, appeal is liable to be set aside.
B
 Denied. There is no provisions in the Customs Act, 1969 that any imported consignment can be allowed in-bonding without assessment. Further Board's letter has no force of law as the same is not protected under the Customs Act, 1969. Every Customs officers is under obligation to process any importable and exportable consignment in the light of provisions of the Customs Act, 1969. Moreover no in-bonded consignment can be assessed provisional under section 81 of the Customs Act, 1969 either on the request of importer or on the directives of any Customs Officer.
C.
 Denied. The learned Collector of Customs (Appeals) has rightly observed in impugned Order-in-Appeal No. 1064 / 2016 dated 05.10.2016. That no assessment is made after in-bonding of any imported consignment under section 29 of the Customs Act, 1969.
D.
 Denied. The reference of Pakistan Vanaspati Manufacturer Association's letter No. PVMA/ 1007/ Value/2015 dated 29.04.2015 is not relevant because the said letter was issued on 29.04.2015 whereas, consignment was in-bonded on 07.04.2015 and first Ex-Bonded Good Declaration was completed on 08.04.2015. The question is as to how Ex-bond GD was re-assessed at US$ 782 per metric ton on 08.04.2015 on the basis of Pakistan Vanaspati Manufacturer Association's letter No. PVMA/ 1007/ Value/ 2015 dated 29.04.2015; the statement made in appeal is incorrect.
E.
 Denied. The statement is not only incorrect but also against the provisions of law. The Interpretation of section 80(3) of the Customs Act, 1969 is incorrect As a matter of fact and law, the assessment orders passed under section 80 of the Customs Act, 1969 are Quasi Judicial Order which can only be re-opened by the concerned Collector or Board under section 195 of Customs Act, 1969 or aggrieved party can file an appeal before Collector of Customs (Appeals) under section 193-A of the Customs Act, 1969.
F.
 Accepted. The contention of appellant that the powers exercised by the respondent under the provisions of law are therefore, rightly exercise and no illegality was committed in any manner. If so then why the appellant has filed this appeal which is required to be dismissed only on this ground.
G.
 Denied. The observations of The learned Collector of Customs (Appeals) are correct and lawful. It is pointed out that the guarantees were in-cashed without fulfilling the requirements of law and information of the importers/ Respondent No. 1. The real fact is that guarantees were in-cashed illegally in the month of June to show higher recovery of Collectorate of Customs Port Muhammad Bin Qasim MCC (PQ) Karachi,
H.
 Denied. The Collector of Customs (Appeals) has rightly observed in the impugned Order-in-Appeal No. 1064/2016 dated 05.10.2016 that the concerned officers of the Collectorate of Customs (PQ) Karachi have not performed their duty honestly diligently and also harassment has been caused to the Tax payers. The observations of the learned Collector of Customs (Appeals) are highly appreciable in the eyes of law.
I.
 Denied. The impugned Order-In-Appeal is a speaking order sustainable under the four corners of law which deserves to be upheld.
In view of above submissions it is most humbly requested that the Customs Appellate Tribunal may be pleased to kindly uphold the impugned Order-in-Appeal No. 1064/2016 dated 05.10.2016 and dismiss the said appeal with cost in the interest of justice.
7.
 We have heard both the contesting parties at some length and also examined the relevant record. The controversy in this case involves both points of fact and law. The core issue is that the Respondent party declared value of imported goods as US$ 715/M.T whereas the Appellant Department assessed the same on value US$ 782/M.T in the light of Soyabean Oil prices as per Reuter as on 26.01.2015. In total, nine (9) Into-Bond Goods Declarations were filed by the Respondent party in April, 2015 in order to get their imported consignments of ""Crude Degummed Soyabean Oil"" cleared for in-bonding. The contention of the Appellant Department is that since the ""imported bulk oil is immediately discharged from vessel which is directly pumped from the vessel through pipelines to offdock oil tanks of bonded warehouses for direct in-bonding without any assessment as vital information such as test report confirming the exact composition whether fit for human consumption, value and Pakistan Standard Quality Control Authority (PSQCA)'s conformity certificate are not available at the time of arrival of the vessel. As such no assessment is made at the time of arrival/in-bonding of bulk oil cargo and the Goods Declaration is endorsed to the effect that all aspects shall be checked at the time of ex-bonding of the goods"". Therefore, in the view of the Appellant Department all Into-Bond Goods Declarations were not assessed to duty and taxes. The Appellant Department relies on F.B.R's letter No.1(2)S(Valutaion/2000 dated 12.11.2003 for assessment purpose which requires to assess the imported edible oil as per Reuter Price confirmed by Pakistan Vanaspati Manufacturer's Association (PVMA) as on the relevant contract date. The Memo. of Appeal adds that ""since at the time of arrival/ in-bonding of cargo on 31.03.2015 such information (Reuter price duly endorsed by the PVMA) was not available which was subsequently provided on 29.04.2015, as such, no assessment could be made at the time of in-bonding of the goods.
8.
 On the other hand, the stance taken by the Respondent party is altogether different. They state that the position taken by the Appellant Department amounts to Mis-statement. During hearing, the learned Counsel stated that the Department had finalized assessment at the time of in-bonding of the imported consignment, as required under the law. He added that in terms of section 29 of the Customs Act, 1969, no amendment of Goods Declaration can be done after the goods have been removed from the Customs area. He also relied on section 88 (5) of the said Act which requires that the bona fide error in a Goods Declaration can be rectified only before warehousing of the goods. On a query that as to why they made written request to the Department dated 27.04.2015 for provisional assessment of the goods in terms of section 81 of the Customs Act, 1969, the learned Counsel responded that the officers of the Appellant Department forced them to do so otherwise they would not process their Ex-Bond Goods Declarations. The Counsel also argued that section 81 of the Customs Act, 1969 does not require an application from the importer. During the course of hearing, the learned Departmental Representative of the Appellant stated that goods were provisionally assessed to duty and taxes on 27.04.2015 while the said assessment was finalized on 29.04.2015. The learned D.R, however, could not present evidence of Provisional Assessment or Final Assessment except a letter of the Respondent party dated 27.04.2015 containing request for provisional assessment. The letter of PVMA dated 29.04.2015 highlights average value US$ 782.90/ M.T prevailing on 26.01.2015.
9.
 It is observed that there is some contradiction in the stance taken by the Appellant Department in their Memo. of Appeal and the case presented by the learned Counsel for the Respondent party. As per Memo. of Appeal, the Appellant as highlighted at para 7 above, has unambiguously stated that at the time of in-bonding, the goods were not assessed to duty and taxes for want of information like exact composition of the goods, whether fit for human consumption or not, value and PSQCA's conformity certificate. The minute scrutiny of all the Into-Bond Goods Declarations reveal that the Appellant Department assessed each Goods Declaration to duty and taxes in terms of section 80 of the Customs Act, 1969 and accepted the total declared value of the Respondent party in Pak Rupee terms as Rs.36,727,116/- (US$ 715 per M.T) for 500 M.T of Soyabean Oil (column 56 of each G.D) which leads us to conclude conveniently that the position taken by the Appellant Department is not only contradictory, unsubstantiated but also incorrect insofar as the facts of the case are concerned.
10. 
 Now, we would like to examine the legal issues involved in the controversy. Section 88 (5) of the Customs Act, 1969 stipulates that ""if the quantity or value of any goods has been incorrectly stated in the Goods Declaration due to inadvertence or bona fide error, the error may be rectified at any time before the warehousing of the goods is completed, and not subsequently"". As mentioned above, the Appellant Department had assessed the imported consignments to duty and taxes in terms of section 80 of the Customs Act, 1969. We would like to mention here that some Goods Declarations show a stamp placed thereon by the Appellant Department which highlights that ""Ex-Bonding subject to check all aspect, Test Report, Valuation etc"". Here our observation/ comments are that the said stamping/endorsement does not and cannot over-ride the statutory provisions. Section 84 of the Customs Act, 1969 speaks of warehousing of dutiable goods where the goods have been assessed under section 80 or 81 ibid. As mentioned earlier, there is no trace of any Provisional Assessment nor Final Assessment in terms of section 81 of the Customs Act, 1969, therefore, it is obvious that the goods against all Goods Declaration were assessed to duty and taxes under section 80 of the Customs Act, 1969. Once goods assessed under the said provision of law, cannot be re-assessed. The remedy is available only to file appeal under section 193 of the said Act against the Assessment Order or invoke provisions of section 195. Here we would endorse plea taken by the learned Counsel of the Respondent party that under section 29 of the Customs Act, 1969, no amendment of Goods Declaration, except as provided in section 88 shall be allowed after such goods have been removed from the Customs area. Regarding F.B.R's letter dated 12.11.2013 whereby the Appellant Department assessed the imported consignment, the same does not carry any legal sanctity. The letter infact contains minutes of meeting held between F.B.R and the representatives of P.V.M.A. The legal position with regard to determining value of imported consignment is that section 25 of the Customs Act, 1969 prescribes methods for the purpose. The Appellant Department has not followed any of such methods instead they have relied on F.B.R's letter under reference which, as earlier stated, does not carry any legal value. At this juncture, we would endorse observation of the learned Collector, Customs (Appeals), Karachi that ""There was no dispute regarding the customs value at the time of in-bonding, therefore, assessment stood completed and goods were removed from the Customs area."" We further endorse his observations that ""When the appellant filed cx-bond goods declaration, the respondent unauthorizedly opened past and closed transaction and challenged the customs value and processed the goods declaration at a higher value, and upon resistance of the appellant, invoked section 81 of the Customs Act, 1969 and secured pay orders for the additional amount. The action was taken in case of 17 ex-bond dated April to September, 2015 the respondents made further mockery of law by encashing all the pay orders without issuing any order under section 81(5) of the Customs Act, 1969, within the stipulated period."" We cannot restrain ourselves for endorsing another pertinent observation of the learned Collector that ""The supervisory officers are advised to take appropriate action against the delinquents for jeopardizing probable revenue and causing harassment to the tax payers.""
11.
 In view of above, we are led to conclude that the Appellant Department has miserably failed to legally prove their case. We uphold the impugned Order-in Appeal being a lawful Order. The appeal of the Appellant Department is dismissed as the same is without merit.

 MUHAMMAD JUNAID GHAFFAR, J.--
Through this common order, we intend to dispose of C.P No.D-2229/2017, C.M.A. No.11486/20i7 in C.P No.D-1696/2016 and C.M.A. No.11484/2017 in C.P. No.D-7597/2015 as they involve common prayer made on behalf of the Petitioner.
2.
 Precisely stated facts appear to be that the Petitioner was initially detained for a period of 90 days under Section 11EEEE of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 and thereafter was arrested in two References bearing Nos.13 and 19 of 2016. In both these References through a common order passed in C.Ps Nos.D-1696/2016 and 7597/2015, on 29.03.2017 by a majority decision of two is to one, the petitioner was granted bail on medical grounds. While granting bail, the Petitioner was. also directed to deposit his Passports before the Nazir of this Court, whereas, directions were also issued to the Ministry of Interior not to issue any fresh or duplicate Passport and to place the name of the Petitioner on Exit Control List (""ECL""). Through both the aforesaid C.M.As, it has been prayed to direct the Nazir to return the two Passports of the Petitioner and so also for removal of his name from ECL. Whereas, through C.P No.D-2229/2017, the Petitioner has made the following prayer(s):-
i.
 Declare, that the memorandum No.12/260/2015-ECL, dated November, 24th 2015 is unconstitutional, without jurisdiction, unlawful, void ob initio, and set aside and in consequence the name of the petitioner be removed from the ECL;
ii.
 Allow the release of the passports of the petitioner, retained under orders of this Hon'ble Court, with the Nazir of this Hon'ble Court, while allowing bails to the Petitioner, in Cr. Bail Application No.993/2016 and C.P.No.D-7597/2015 and C.P. No.1696/2016, without which the Petitioner obviously would be incapacitated from travelling.
iii.
 Permanently and pending disposal of the main Petition suspend the operation of the Memorandum 12/260/2015-ECL dated November, 24th 2015;
iv.
 Restrain the Respondents, their officers, agents and their functionaries from hampering, hindering and stopping the Petitioner's movement within or outside Pakistan in any matter whatsoever;
v.
 Any other writ, relief or direction, expedient in the interest of justice may also be issued in vindication for the grievance afore referred.""
3.
 Learned Counsel for the Petitioner has contended that initially the Petitioner was detained under Section 11EEEE of the Act, 1997 and thereafter was taken into custody by the NAB Authorities; though neither any inquiry, investigation or reference was pending. He has further submitted that during this period; the petitioner's name was placed on ECL through Letter dated 24.11.2015 and thereafter two References bearing Nos.13 and 19 of 2016 were filed in which Petitioner has been granted bail on medical grounds. He has contended that insofar as the case registered under the Anti-Terrorism Act is concerned, the Petitioner was earlier granted bail through Order dated 01.11.2016 by a Division Bench of this Court, whereas, the Anti-Terrorism Court has granted permission to travel for Medical treatment against surety of Petitioners Medical Hospital. Learned counsel has contended that the Medical Reports of the Petitioner on the basis of which he was granted bail by this Court very clearly suggests that the Petitioner suffers with a number of diseases. He has contended that Lumber Disc replacement of the Petitioner is to be carried out, which facility is not available in the Country. Learned Counsel has referred to various Reports of Aga Khan Hospital, OMI Hospital, Liaquat Medical University, Dow Medical University and has contended that none of them have stated that such medical treatment is available in Pakistan. Learned Counsel has further contended that the Petitioner has already furnished surety and is further willing to give any additional surety, if so directed, whereas, the learned Judge whose view was also endorsed by the Referee Judge very clearly provides in the bail granting order; that deposit of Passport and placing of the Petitioner's name on ECL is until further orders, and therefore, while looking at the health status of the Petitioner, the Passports may be directed to be returned and Petitioner's name be removed from ECL, placed by the Ministry of Interior on the directions of this Court. Insofar as Memorandum dated 24-11-2015 issued by the Ministry of Interior for placing their name of the Petitioner on ECL and challenged through C.P.No.D-2229/2017 is concerned, learned Counsel has contended that the Petitioner was never informed about such action taken by the Ministry of Interior, whereas, even otherwise no reasons have been assigned while placing the name of the Petitioner on ECL. Per learned Counsel the Petitioner should have been informed, whereas, the Memorandum has been issued without any application of mind on the directions of NAB, which is impermissible in law. He has further submitted that till 24.11.2015 there was no Reference pending against the Petitioner; therefore, even otherwise, the Petitioner's name could not have been placed on ECL. In support learned Counsel has relied upon PLD 2011 Sindh 389 (Gen. (Retd.) Pervez Musharaf through Attorney v. Pakistan through Secretary Interior and others), PLD 2016 Supreme Court 570 (Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, M/O Interior v. General Pervez Musharraf and others), PLD 1997 Lahore 617 (Wajid Shamas-ul-Hassan v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Ministry of Interior, Islamabad), PLD 1999 Karachi 177 (Saleem Akhtar v. Federation of Pakistan and another), PLD 2008 Lahore 341 (Sohail Latif and 2 others v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Interior, Government of Pakistan, Islamabad and 2 others), PLD 2010 Lahore 230 (Mian Ayaz Anwar v.

 On the other hand, the learned Assistant Attorney General has read out the comments of Ministry of Interior and has submitted that name of the petitioner was placed on ECL on the request of NAB Authorities as the Petitioner is an accused, whereas, this .Court while granting bail has also directed the Ministry of Interior to place the name of the Petitioner on ECL, which has accordingly been done.
5.
 Learned Special Prosecutor NAB has contended that this Court while granting bail on medical grounds has apprised all such Medical Reports, which are now being relied upon on behalf of the Petitioner and despite all these reports specific directions were given to retain the Passport of the Petitioner and so also his name was placed on ECL. He has contended that such order was consciously passed by the Court, which cannot be altered or modified through miscellaneous application or through an independent Constitution Petition. He has also placed on record copy of order dated 19.04.2017 passed in C.P No.D-214/2016, in the case of Zuhair Siddiqui v. Chairman NAB and others in one of the very References, whereby, such request of the Petitioner for return of Passport has been disallowed. Insofar as the Memorandum dated 24.11.2015 is concerned, learned Counsel has referred to Section 2 of the ECL Ordinance, 1981 as well as Rule 2 of The Exit From Pakistan (Control) Rules 2010, and has contended that the Petitioner is involved in huge corruption of billions of rupees, therefore, NAB was justified in requesting the Ministry of Interior to place the name of Petitioner on ECL. He has further contended that alternate remedy was available. under Section 3 of the Ordinance to challenge such Memorandum and therefore, the Petitioner has not approached this Court with clean hands. Learned Special Prosecutor NAB has further contended that all such case law relied upon on behalf of the Petitioner is distinguishable in facts, therefore, the Petition as well as miscellaneous applications be dismissed. He has relied upon the cases reported as PLD 2009 Karachi 243 (Habibullah Niazi v. Federation of Pakistan through Federal Secretary, Ministry of Interior, Pakistan Secretariat, Islamabad and 2 others), 2016 YLR 177 (Asif Kamal v. Government of Pakistan and others), PLD 1997 Karachi 513 (Miss Naheed Khan v. Government of Pakistan and others) and 2011 SCMR 271 (Prime Minister Inspection Team National Highway Authority v. Zaheer Mirza and others).
6.
 While exercising his right of rebuttal, learned Counsel for the Petitioner has referred to Chapter XXVI of the Criminal Procedure Code and has contended that order, whereby, bail was granted is not a judgment, which could have attained finality, and therefore, the same can be modified or varied, if the circumstances so required.
7.
 We have heard the learned Counsel for the Petitioner, learned Special Prosecutor NAB as well as learned Assistant Attorney General and have perused the record. The facts have already been discussed hereinabove and for the sake of brevity need not be repeated. The Petitioner while in custody filed two separate Petitions bearing Nos.D-7597/15 and 1696/2016, wherein, hearing was concluded on 18.01.2017 and thereafter the order was announced on 03.02.2017 and both the learned Judges had differed in their opinions as one of them (Karim Khan Agha, J) had granted bail on medical grounds, whereas, the other learned Judge (Muhammad Farooq Shah, J) had dismissed the petitions. Thereafter the matter was referred to a Referee Judge by the honourable Chief Justice, who vide order dated 22.03.2017 agreed with the opinion/decision of the learned Judge, who had granted bail on the medical grounds to the petitioner. The operative part of the bail granting Order dated 03.02.2017 reads as under:-.
""34. Thus, based on the discussion above, the petitioner is hereby granted bail on medical grounds as we have found based on the above discussion that (a) the sickness or ailment with which the petitioner is suffering is such that it cannot be properly treated within the premises of jail (greater emphasize) and that some specialized treatment is needed and his continued detention in jail is likely to affect his capacity and is hazardous to his life in both of the above mentioned references subject to him furnishing solvent surety in the sum of Rs.25 Lacs in respect of each reference and PR bond in the like amount in each reference subject to the satisfaction of the Nazir this court and depositing his original passport with the Nazir of this court. The Ministry of Interior is directed not to issue the petitioner with any fresh or duplicate passports until the further orders of this court and to place the name of the petitioner on the ECL...""
8.
 The learned Referee Judge (Aftab Ahmed Gorar, J.) through order dated 22.3.2017 while agreeing with the said Order observed as follows:-
""In view of the above circumstances and the dicta laid down by the Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan as well as this Court in the case of Muzammil Niazi v. the State reported in PLD 2003 Karachi 526, referred to above, I am agreed with the opinion/decision of my learned brother Mr. Mohammad Karim Khan Agha, J.
9.
 The final order of the Court dated 29.03.2017 reads as under:--
""By majority View, the opinion/decision tendered by my learned brothel Mr; Muhammad Karim Khan Agha, J. on 03.02.2017, in captioned C.P.No.D-1696/2016 and C.P No.D-7597/2015 shall prevail. The petitions to the extent of bail plea are allowed.""
10.
 Insofar as the contention of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner to the effect that the bail granting order passed by our learned Brother Mr. Muhammad Karim Khan Agha, J. is until further orders of this Court is concerned; we may observe that such part of the order is only applicable and relatable to the directions of the Court, whereby, Ministry of Interior was directed not to issue the Petitioner any fresh or duplicate Passport. Whereas, it has no nexus with the directions given while granting bail subject to furnishing solvent surety in the sum of Rs.25,00,000/- in respect of each reference and P.R. bond in the like amount and deposit of his original Passport with the Nazir of this Court. It is only the directions to the Ministry of Interior regarding issuance of any duplicate Passport for which words ""until further orders"" have been used. In our considered view it had no nexus with the deposit of. Passport with the Nazir of this Court and so also for placing the name of the Petitioner on ECL therefore, this contention is misconceived and is hereby repelled.
11.
 Whereas, even otherwise, we are of the view that the said order has been passed after a detailed examination of at least ten (10) Medical Reports of the various Boards constituted from time to time on the directions of the Trial Court, including two letters from Hospitals. The learned Judge has examined all such Medical Reports threadbare and while granting bail has made a definitive conclusion that the treatment so required by the Petitioner is not available within the jail premises and further that some specialized treatment is needed and his continued detention in jail is likely to affect his capacity and is hazardous to his life. Learned Judge while coming to such conclusion must have kept in mind the Medical Reports and the findings therein, however, notwithstanding the said Medical Reports, the learned Judge while granting bail on medical grounds felt satisfied that the Petitioner's Passport be retained and his name be placed on ECL. It is also fact that in various Medical Reports discussed in the said order time and again. the Surgery aspect of the Lumber Disc Replacement has been mentioned and has even been highlighted by the Judge in his order. Such order of the learned Judge was passed consciously and so also keeping in mind that the Petitioner requires medical treatment including Lumber Disc Replacement, but even then his Passport was retained and his name was also placed on ECL. If there would have been any other situation or thinking on the part of the learned Judge, who had gone to the extent of granting bail purely on medical grounds, learned Judge would not have issued such directions and would have rather ordered for release of the Petitioner on mere surety. But this is not the case as in addition to the surety, very conscious directions were issued, whereby, the Petitioner was directed to surrender his Passports with the Nazir of this Court and Ministry of Interior was also directed to place his name on ECL. Such order in our opinion has attained finality and the only recourse available to the Petitioner was to challenge the same further before the honourable Supreme Court. It further appears that the learned Referee Judge who has agreed with the view taken by our learned Brother Muhammad Karim Khan Agha, J. has done so in totality including the conditions attached in the bail granting order, notwithstanding that petitioner was being bailed out on medical grounds. This again is conscious view of the learned Referee Judge. Insofar reliance on order of the Court dated 29.03.2017 to the effect that there are no such directions in the final order is concerned; again we may observe that this contention is also misconceived inasmuch as it has been very clearly observed by the Court that by majority view the opinion/decision tendered by our learned Brother Muhammad Karim Khan Agha, J. dated 03.02.2017 shall prevail and Petitions to that extent of bail plea are allowed. This is nothing but endorsing the view taken by our learned Brother Muhammad Karim Khan Agha, J. duly affirmed by the Referee Judge, and in both these opinions there are direction to deposit the Passport of the Petitioner and for placing his name on ECL.
12.
 It may further be observed that reliance of various letters of Hospitals, like Aga Khan Hospital, OMI Hospital, Liaqual Medical University, Dow Medical University etc is also of no help inasmuch as all these letters are prior to the passing of Order of bail on 3.2.2017, and were either not placed before the Court, or shall be deemed to have been placed or considered. Now at this stage of the proceedings when the petitions stands decided we cannot go into facts which had already been considered or new facts as well as the order has attained finality. In our view on subsequent application(s) like these, the said order cannot be interfered with so as to review it or otherwise modify, which has been passed by the Court after due care and by exercising its own discretion in the matter so vested in it. In our understanding the appropriate remedy to the Petitioners was to further challenge the said portion of the order by which they were aggrieved. By entertaining these applications subsequently, we would be either amending the order or modifying it after disposal of these petitions, which we are afraid, cannot be done through such applications.
13.
 A learned Division Bench of Lahore High Court in the case of Tariq Masood v. Director General, National Accountability Bureau, Lahore and another (PLD 2012 Lahore 287) had the occasion to decide a miscellaneous application, in a matter under the NAB Ordinance, whereby, the Petitioner was though granted bail in the sum of Rs.200,000/- with two sureties each in the like amount, however, additionally was also ordered to deposit a security of Rs.25,00,000/- as well. The Petitioner had subsequently moved an application which was initially dismissed, whereafter it was challenged before the honorable Supreme Court but was withdrawn. Thereafter the petitioner filed another application in respect of the condition of deposit in the bail order. The Petitioners' contention was that the condition of deposit of cash security was not in accordance with law and while referring to Sections 497 and 499 Cr.P.C. reliance was placed on a number of citations as mentioned in Para-4 of the said Judgment. This application was opposed on behalf of NAB on the ground that a white collar crime by misappropriating funds was committed, and therefore, keeping in view the spirit of NAB Ordinance, the Court had rightly directed the Petitioner to deposit the cash security. The said application was dismissed by the learned Division Bench of the Lahore High Court and the relevant observation reads as under:-
""A bare perusal of the aforementioned provision of law would reveal that sections 497, 498 and 561-A, Cr.P.C, or any other provision of the Code, of any other law for the time being in force, are not applicable to the offences falling under National Accountability Ordinance, 1999. Even otherwise, according to section 3, the provisions of the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999, have an over-riding effect notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force. However, High Court, under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, has the jurisdiction to grant bail to an accused facing prosecution for an offence under the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999. In the case of Abdul Aziz Khan Niazi v The State through Chairman, NAB, Islamabad PLD 2003 Supreme Court 668), it was pronounced that High Court has the power to grant bail under Article 199 of Constitution, independent of any statutory source of jurisdiction such as section 497, Cr.P.C. Needless to observe that ouster of jurisdiction of High Court to grant bail in scheduled offences has been done away by amendment in section 9(b) of National Accountability Ordinance, 1999, after omission of the word ""including the High Court"". The High Court, while considering the question of bail in its Constitutional jurisdiction, in the interest of safe administration of justice, can examine the nature of allegations on the basis of tentative assessment of the evidence in hands of prosecution to ascertain, prima facie, the question of guilt or innocence of an accused for the purpose of grant or refusal of bail and without expressing any opinion on merits of the case, lest it should prejudice the accused or prosecution. The rule of departure from the provisions of section 497, Cr.P.C. in presence of the special enactment is enunciated in the case of Chaudhry Shujat Hussain v. The State (1995 SCMR 1249), wherein, it has been observed that in case of conflict between the provisions of the Offences in Respect of Banks (Special Courts) Ordinance of 1984, and the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure regarding scheduled offences, the Ordinance, 1984, being a special law, would prevail. Therefore, the provisions of sections 497 and 499, Cr.P.C. will not stricto sensu apply to the cases falling under the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999, in view of sections 3 and 9(b) of the Ordinance ibid. In the case of The State v. Muhammad Hasham Babar (PLD 1997 Lahore 605), it was held that the area of askinq security from the accused who is allowed bail, is vacant and the Court is not enjoined under the law to mathematically follow the system of securities, provided in the Code of Criminal Procedure. In the case supra, it was laid down that under the new dispensation, i.e. Ehtesab Ordinance (XX of 1997), which was an earlier enactment on the subject of accountability, the Court has ample power to ask for cash security in appropriate cases.""(Emphasis supplied)
14.
 It is also of pivotal importance to note that the idea behind seeking surety while granting a bail is to secure the attendance of the accused before the Trial Court. Now what is that will ensure such attendance is for the Court granting bail to decide keeping in view the peculiar facts and circumstances of each case independently. Once such security or surety of whatsoever nature has been incorporated in the bail granting order, no further deviation is permissible for another Division Bench of the same Court to take on a subsequently filed miscellaneous application. If this is permitted as a routine and barring exceptions, then it will disturb the entire spirit, procedure and process of the Court and will never put an end to these proceedings which specially in these matters pertaining to NAB Ordinance, are only confined to the grant of Bail or otherwise. This Court is not the trial Court which normally grants bail and ensures the attendance of the accused. This difference has to be kept in mind while entertaining any such application. In our considered view when bail was granted to the petitioners, it was felt necessary by the Court to procure passports and to place his name of ECL, as the Court while granting bail is duty bound to prescribe the type of surety it needs for securing the attendance of the accused. Even a routine bail order contains certain conditions between the lines. In this matter in our view the order for surrendering passports and placement of name on ECL was done as a practice and routine being followed in bails pertaining to NAB matters and we do not find any illegality otherwise so as to upset it, as it would be an impediment in the proper administration of justice which the learned Court thought it to be fit and just in fact and law. Courts are not required to pass mechanical orders; rather it has to take into consideration the status of sureties, their validity, as well as circumstances which would provide satisfaction to the Court that the order of concession of bail would not be misused.
15.
 In the case of Muhammad Ayub v. Mst. Nasim Akhtar and another (1984 PCr.LJ 160) the Hon'ble Supreme Court of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir had the occasion to examine the condition attached to a bail granting order. The relevant finding reads as under;
13. The provision of section 498 of the Criminal Procedure Code confers vast discretionary powers on the High Court and the Sessions Court (District Criminal Court). If the High Court and the District Criminal Court has the powers to pass the bail order in a fit and a proper case then surely it has the competency to pass any conditional bail order if in its estimation circumstances of the case so warrant. Though of course the Courts normally would not and should not pass any conditional order beyond those normal conditions visualised under section 499 of the Criminal Procedure Code but to hold that the Court has no power to pass a conditional bail order in a non-bailable case under, any circumstance would be a wrong exposition of law. The provisions of section 498 admit no such limitation. In Emperor v. H. L. Hutchinson (AIR 1931 All. 365) a Division Bench case, it was observed that the High Court's power of granting bail is conferred on it under section 498 and is entirely unfettered by any condition. The Legislature has given the High Court and the Court of Session discretion to act under section 498 unfettered by any limitation other than that which controls all discretionary powers vested in a Judge viz. that the discretion must be exercised judicially. In this case the learned Division Bench while allowing bail ordered as: -
""We direct that the applicant Mr. H. L. Hutchinson be admitted to bail to the satisfaction of District Magistrate who will of course see that the bail is adequate but not excessive. Before the applicant be admitted to bail they must give an undertaking in writing to the District Magistrate that they will not take part in any public demonstration or agitation.""
In AIR 1958 Tripura 34, the petitioner alleged to be a Pakistani was arrested and charged under section 3 read with section 12 of the Official Secrets Act. While allowing the bail the learned Judge passed the order in the following terms:--
""There is no reason as to why the bail should be refused to the petitioner but there appears to be some justification in the request of the learned Government Advocate that in case bail is allowed some safeguard may be imposed to prevent the petitioner from quietly leaving this territory.""
So the learned Judge apart from requiring the bail bond of Rs.5,000 with two sureties in the like amount also ordered the petitioner not to leave the Municipal bounds of Agartala without written permission of the District Magistrate.
14.
 In: re Saradamana and others (AIR 1965 Andh. Pra. 444), it was held that the Court allowing bail in a non-bailable case if feels necessary has power to, impose condition. Bail in that case was allowed with the condition that the accused were to stay at a particular place during the whole period of trial whereas the home town of accused was some 200 miles away. While considering the point the learned Judge in the High Court observed that the conditional bail order could legally be passed while allowing bail in a non-bailable case though in that case the condition imposed was considered to be unreasonable and exceptionally hard so it was modified. For the above stated reasons we find that the District Criminal Court had the powers to pass a conditional bail order so therefore, the order passed by the District Criminal Court on 7th August, 1982 requiring the surety to be a Mehram was in accordance with law. The impugned judgment passed by the Shariat Court could not, therefore, be sustained.
15.
 The order dated 7th August, 1982, passed by the District Criminal Court was to the effect that the respondent was to be released on the surety of Mehram. Broadly speaking the order could be termed as a bail order with a condition precedent yet however, it is different from the conditional bail orders generally passed. Conditions whether incorporated in bail bond or otherwise generally operate after the release and if found violated those may entail either in the forfeiture of the bond or cancellation of the bail. In the present case the position is however different. On the surety of any one from among the class of Mehram the respondent was to be released. After the release neither the surety nor the respondent were bound by any condition except those visualised under section 499. So the order passed by the District Criminal Court was really a choice of proper surety under the circumstances. We are unable to agree with the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the respondent that the object of asking for the sureties and the furnishing of bonds is only to ensure the presence of the accused before the Court and beyond that no other condition could be attached.
16.
 Similarly in the case of Hakim Ali Zardari v The State (PLD 1998 SC 1), the order of learned Lahore High Court whereby while granting bail a condition for furnishing deposit of Rs.10 Million and surrender of passport was made in a case emanating from the Ehtesab Act, 1997 (predecessor law of NAB Ordinance), was maintained by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in appeal by a majority decision of two is to one.
17.
 Moreover, in respect of another accused (Zuhair Siddiqui) in Reference No.19/2016, which is also subject matter of these petitions, we have already dismissed a similar application vide order dated 19.4.2017 in C.P.No.214 of 2016 by following our earlier order dated 7.4.2017 passed in C.P. No.D-6599 of 2015 (Muhammad Imran v Federation of Pakistan) and other connected matters. In the circumstances both the C.M.A's are dismissed.
18.
 Moreover, insofar as prayer clause (ii) in C.P. No.2229 of 2017 is concerned, the same cannot even otherwise be granted through the said petition, as for such purposes an independent application has already been filed in other petitions, Whereas, even otherwise, any order passed in a Constitution Petition cannot be challenged and/or modified through a separate petition. Insofar as the other prayer regarding Memorandum dated 24.11.2015 is concerned; since the name of the Petitioner is now placed on ECL on the basis of an order passed by this Court while granting bail to the Petitioner and which we have maintained by dismissing the miscellaneous applications, the same has become meaningless and therefore, no further adjudication on the said Memorandum is required. Accordingly petition is also dismissed.
19.
 In the given facts and circumstances of this case petition bearing No.D-2229/2017, and both C.M.A. Nos.11486/2017 in C.P. No.D-1696/2016. and C.M.A. No.11484/2017 in C.P. No.D-7597/2015 are dismissed.

 SHAKIL AHMED ABBASI, PRESIDING OFFICER.---
By this order I will dispose of Application under section 249-A, Cr.P.C. filed on behalf of both the accused persons through their Counsel.
 The facts of the prosecution case in nutshell are that the complainant Khurum Zakiuddin who was the authorized agent of the Casio Company made an application against the accused persons for making, illegally trading/assembling of Counterfeit watches of the said Company. Such application of the complainant was received by FIA Authorities on 13.1.2016 As such, on 23.01.2016, FIR was lodged against the accused persons and raid was conducted and accused persons were caught hold red handed having in possession of Counterfeit watches worth of Rs. 10,000/-. The FIA Authorities have taken action against the accused persons while they were committing violation of section 66-A (the correct applicable section 66 should have been mentioned) of the Copyright Ordinance, 1962, as such both the accused persons were produced before Judicial Magistrate and two days remand was granted. During remand both the accused persons were released on bail by the Trial Court and subsequently after completing all the investigation accused person were challaned before the Court of Judicial Magistrate (XVth) South (holding charge before transfer of the case to this Tribunal) by the FIA Authorities as such necessary documents were supplied to them.
 Heard Mr. Bilal Rasheed Advocate, counsel for accused persons on Application under section 249-A ibid. He argued that accused persons are innocent, respectable members of business community and are being falsely implicated into this Criminal case by the complainant in connivance of FIA officials just to cause harassment and obtain pecuniary advantages from the accused persons. Further he contended that whatsoever material was seized by the FIA authorities, accused have the computerized generated bills for the sale and purchase of those Casio watches. He further argued that accused have not manufactured the seized watches in violation of any provision of Copyright Ordinance, but as per receipt the seized watches were purchased from authorized person of the Casio company and the same were also furnished to the I.O. on investigation. Hence they committed no offence. He further urged that the matter is pending before the Hon'ble Court (now before this Tribunal) since January 2016 and complainant never appeared before the Hon'ble Court (now before this Tribunal) for the evidence, which shows that the lack of interest of complainant because the complainant knows that the accused has not committed any offence and he has filed a false case due to professional grudges. Furthermore, the goods which were seized by FIA authorities are still in custody of FIA. Lastly he prayed that this Tribunal to acquit the accused persons from the charge in the above case, as the charge is groundless and there is no probability of being convicted. The learned Counsel did not press the grounds Nos. 3 to 8 regarding wrong mentioning of provision of section 66-A and on the meaning of Copyright as per section 3 of the Copyright Ordinance Ibid, as such, I need not dilate upon those.
 Mr. Bakhtiar Channa, learned Assistant Director Legal FIA, vehemently opposed the Application of the accused persons being devoid of the specific ground of Application under section 249-A, Cr.P.C. He further argued that the recovery was effected from the hand of the accused persons. Hence, he requested for dismissal of instant Application.
 I have considered with conscious thought the arguments advanced by both the Counsel and carefully examined the record of the case with their assistance. I tend to agree with the arguments advance by learned counsel for accused persons which merit their acquittal under section 249-A ibid. Even otherwise, on perusal of record, following deficiencies/defects are noted to demolish the Prosecution case casting many doubts, the benefit of which should go to the accused persons. Some of which are as under:
(a)
 It is found from the record that the case is pending for last more than one year for recording of evidence of Prosecution witnesses, but the same could not be produced for one reason or the other, causing delay in disposal of matter and most of the time delay is caused due to non-attendance of the prosecution side to produce witnesses and lead evidence;
(b)
 That the charge along with the pleas of accused persons is conspicuously found missing from the R & P of court file nor the same has been mentioned in the index sheet as well as the same have nowhere been numbered;
(c)
 That as per mashirnama no independent witness is found mentioned in it, nor as per list of prosecution witness no independent witness is found as cited as such mandatory compliance of section 103 bid is not made.
(d)
 The Prosecution has not taken any action against the supplier/manufacturer of the alleged infringed/counterfeit product as being pointed out by the accused persons to the I.O. during investigation.
(e)
 More importantly on perusal of record, it is found that the complaint is being made for violation of copyright of the complainant, whereas no evidence is being filed of its registration in the name of the complainant. Simply the copy of Application for registration is being filed which does not amount to registration to create a prima-facie evidence of ownership. Although registration of a copyright is not compulsory, yet no other evidence is being furnished to prove the creation and the use of the alleged infringed/counterfeit artistic work /logo of the complainant. Reliance of the prosecution in this regard upon Letter of Casio Company to the effect of owning the Copyright is immaterial to prove its bona fide ownership beyond reasonable doubt as the same is not being supported/enclosed with the alleged infringed/counterfeit artistic work/Logo under the title ""Casio G-SHOCK"". Even on factual ground while examining the case property in presence of both the counsel it is found that the artistic work/logo ""Casio EDIFICE"" is not found mentioned/appearing on the suspected seized case property, as mentioned in FIR and the Charge sheet. Interestingly the artistic work/logo appearing on those seized watches is entirely different from suspected logo i.e. ""Casio Edifice"". As such, the same is quite different artistic work/logo and also under a different title i.e. ""Casio G-Shock"" and distinguishable not at all likely to cause any deception or confusion to an unwary purchaser. The Prosecution should have examined this crucial and material aspect of the matter under the scheme of copyright law and given its finding in the charge sheet. Further the Prosecution should also not be influenced/misled by Trade Mark Registration under the Trade Marks Ordinance, while registering a case and placing charge sheet vis-a-vis offence of infringement/violation of a Copyright under the Copyright Ordinance.
 In view of the above discussion and finding of facts, it is held that the Prosecution has miserably failed to make out its case beyond many reasonable doubts, as such no offence is found committed under section 56 ibid attract provisions of section 66 Ibid. Accordingly, the Accused Persons merit acquittal from the offence. Resultantly, the Application under section 249-A ibid is allowed. The accused persons are on bail, their bail bonds are cancelled and sureties stand discharged. Further, although the charge is not found on record and even if could be there it would have been groundless on the basis of which there would have been no probability of conviction of Accused Persons.
 As regard the case property the accused persons may move an Application for return of it in terms of section 517 ibid which may be decided on its merits.

 WAQAR AHMAD SETH, J.---
Accused-petitioner, Shehnaz wife of Inayatullah, seeks bail in case FIR No. 1174 dated 24.9.2016 under section 302, P.P.C. registered at Police Station Bhana Mari, Peshawar. She has been refused bail by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-VI, Peshawar vide order dated 5.5.2017; hence, the instant petition for the same purpose.
2.
 The order sheet dated 25.5.2017 of Deputy Registrar of this Court is revealed that notice was issued to respondent No.2, which has been returned with the report that he is residing in Chitral, however, he was served through his Cell Phone No. 0345-1114882 but none turned up; hence, the case was placed before the Court for today.
3.
 Arguments of learned counsel for the petitioner as well as learned Additional Advocate General were heard and record of the case was perused.
4.
 Perusal of the record would reveal that initially, Latifullah, complainant lodged a report vide Naqal Mad No. 57 dated 19.9.2016 regarding the murder of his sister/cousin Mst. Amara, who was murdered by giving her poison, and no body was charged. After receiving post mortem report, on 26.9.2016, the complainant recorded his statement under section 164, Cr.P.C. and charged the present accused-petitioner along with her husband Inayatullah for the commission of offence, which fact was further supported by Iqrar-ud-Din, brother of deceased, in his statement recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C. on 1.10.2016. No doubt, the accused-petitioner is charged for the murder of Mst. Amara but there is suckling baby with the accused-petitioner, who is behind the bars for more than one and a half months and three other children outside the jail and at this stage, the welfare of the minors will be taken into account. It is an admitted fact that the punishment provided for the offence is death etc, which falls within the prohibitory clause of section 497(1), Cr.P.C. and the accused-petitioner cannot be released on bail but there is suckling baby inside the jail, who is undoubtedly innocent and is kept in jail with the mother/accused-petitioner for his welfare and three other children outside the jail. The concept of 'welfare of minor' is incompatible with jail life. So, instead of detaining the innocent child infant in the jail for the crime allegedly committed by his mother/accused-petitioner, it would be in the interest of justice as well as welfare of the children if the mother is released from jail. In the famous case of Ghamidiyyah, our Holy Prophet Muhammad (P.B.U.H) had suspended the sentence of pregnant woman, not only till delivery of the child but also postponed it till suckling period i.e. two years, obviously for the welfare of the child. This shows the paramount importance and significance of the right of a suckling baby in Islam and the unprecedented care taken of, and the protection given to a child or expected to be born, by our Holy Prophet Muhammad (P.B.U.H). This golden principle of administration of justice enunciated by the Holy Prophet Muhammad (P.B.U.H) must be strictly observed and followed in our country.
5.
 The above said basic principle has been followed by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Mst. Nusrat v. The State (1996 SCMR 973) and the Hon'ble Lahore High Court in the case of Sadiq Waqas v. The State and another (2012 PCr.LJ 841). Since the petitioner having suckling baby inside the jail and three other children outside the jail, therefore, she should not be kept in jail and the superior Courts had been pleased to grant bail in such situation.
6.
 In view of the above, this bail application is accepted and the accused-petitioner is admitted to bail provided she furnishes bail bond in the sum of Rs. 400,000/- (Rs. Four lacs) with two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate, who shall ensure that the sureties are local, reliable and men of means.

 Above are the reasons of my short order of even date.
JK/169-P
 Bail granted."

 SADAQAT HUSSAIN RAJA, J.---
Through this petition filed under section 44 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act, 1974, following relief is prayed for:--
""It is, therefore, very humbly prayed that by accepting writ petition non-petitioners may kindly be directed to de-notify the said land in favour of the petitioners in light of the orders of the worthy Prime Minister of AJ&K dated 20.03.2012 after receiving amount of award from the petitioners by canceling the award No. 19/98 dated 17.09.1998 to the extent of above mentioned land. Any other relief which deem fit may kindly also be granted to the petitioners in interest of justice.""
Precise stated facts of the case are that petitioners are first class State Subjects of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir and hails from District Hattian Bala. It was contented that land comprising survey No. 133 measuring 5 Kanals situated in Mozia Bani Chakan Tehsil and District Hattian Bala was awarded vide Award No. 19/98 dated 17.09.1998 for the construction of Govt. Boys Middle School Bandi Chakan. It was submitted that due to land sliding the building of school stood damaged and the land has become roar. It was submitted that Collector Land Acquisition has acquired another land comprising survey No. 110,20,16 for construction of said school vide Award No. 09/2012 dated 23.02.2012 and the school is functioning now in the new building. It was stated that land survey No. 133 is no more required for the public purpose for which the same was acquired. It was submitted that on the application of the petitioners officials of Education Department submitted report for de-notification of the said land and Chief Executive has also directed the concerned authorities for de-notification of Award No. 19/98 dated 17.09.1998. It was further submitted that the land is still in possession of the petitioner No.2 and he has made a huge improvement on the same land. It is contended that respondents are duty bound to implement the order of the Prime Minister in letter and spirit.
Respondents have contested the petition by filing comments wherein, it is stated that the building of school stood damaged in the earth-quake of 8th October 2005, however, the land is useable and is being used as playground. The other claims of the petitioners have also been refuted.
The parties have filed written arguments in light of the order of the Court. In the written arguments filed on behalf of the petitioners it was submitted that land comprising survey No.133 measuring 5 kanal situated in village Bandi Chakan was in the ownership of the petitioners which was awarded through award No. 19/98 for construction of Govt. Boys Middle School Bandi Chakan. It is further contended that the said land due to land sliding became roar and on the assurance of Head Master of the school that the land comprising survey No.133 shall be de-awarded, the petitioners gave another land for construction of the school. It was further submitted that land comprising survey No. 110,20,16 has been awarded for construction of the school vide award No.09/12 and after construction of the building the school is functioning on the said land. It was further submitted that petitioners applied to the concerned authorities for de-notification of award No. 19/98 whereupon, the Chief Executive passed the favourabe order. It is contended that as the land is not being used for the purpose for which the same was acquired hence the same shall be de-awarded in favour of the original owners/petitioners. In support of his submission, the learned counsel placed reliance on 2017 YLR 746.
In the written arguments filed on behalf of respondents it is stated that land has been awarded for Govt. Boys Middle School Bandi Chakan and the same is being used for the students as playground, hence, question of de-notification does not arise. It is further contended that the writ petition has been filed with mala fide intension. It is also stated that proceedings for up gradation of Govt. Boys Middle School Bandi Chakan, are in process and for that purpose there should require some extra land therefore, it cannot be said that land may be de-notified on the ground that the same is not being used for the purpose for which the same was acquired.
In the written arguments filed on behalf of the Management School Committee, intervener, herein, it is submitted that though the building of school stood damaged in the earthquake of 2005, however, the land is useable and being used as playground for the students and is also required for other school activities. It is also submitted that the petitioners try to obtain possession of the land however, the education department is continuously in possession of the land as per revenue record.
I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and gone through the record of the case with utmost care.
The claim of the petitioners is that the land has become roar and is not useable whereas, respondents in their comments have submitted that the land is being used as playground and is useable. On this issue Civil Judge Jhelum Valley was appointed as commission vide order dated 02.12.2016 and was directed to make spot inspection and submit report by mentioning as to whether the land in dispute is being used for school purpose or not and as to whether, at present, the land is useable or has become roar. In compliance of Court order Civil Judge Jhelum Valley visited the spot in presence of the parties along with the Tehsildar Hattian Bala as well as Patwari. It is reported by commission that the land in dispute is useable and at present is in possession of the petitioners. It is further reported that the land can be used for the purpose of school activities. It is also reported that the land is now in good condition and can be used for curriculum activities hence, it became clear that land can be used as playground for the students and for other school activities, however, at present, petitioners are in possession of said land. It is admitted position that the land was in ownership and possession of the petitioner when the same was awarded for construction of Govt. Boys Middle School Bandi Chakan, vide award No.19/98 dated 17.09.1998. It is also admitted position that petitioners have obtained the compensation of the same land. The land was acquired for the construction of school building and after the earthquake of 2005 another land comprising survey No. 120,16,10 has been acquired for construction of school and after the award the building of school has been constructed and school is functioning at present. The petitioners have also received the compensation of land acquired vide award No. 09/12. It is correct that if the acquired land is not required for the public purpose or for the purpose for which it was acquired, the same shall be resumed and restored to the original owners or their heirs from whom, it was acquired and if there is no such eventuality the land shall be utilized or disposed of by the Board of Revenue in accordance with the policy of Government regarding disposal of land, as has been held in case titled ""Ghulam Rasool and another v. Said Ahmed and others"" 2012 CLC 1655. The relevant observation has been recorded in para No. 10 of the report as under:-
""The third condition is that if at all, the acquired property is not required for the public purpose or for the purpose for which it is acquired, the same shall be resumed and restored to the original owners or their heirs from whom, it was acquired and if there is no such eventuality, the land shall be utilized or disposed of by Board of Revenue, in accordance with the policy of Government regarding disposal of the land.
The contention of the petitioner that as the land is not being used for the purpose for which the same was acquired hence, the land should be restored to the original owners is devoid of any force because the law is well settled that there is no prohibition for the government to utilize the acquired land for any purpose other than the purpose for which the same was acquired. This proposition has been considered by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in case titled ""Province of Punjab through Collector Lahore and others v. Saeed Ahmed 4 others"" (PLD 1993 SC 455), wherein, in Para No. 12 of the report it was observed as under:--
""The above statement is contrary to the above averment in the written statements made in para 4. Additionally, no material was brought on record to indicate that there was factually any sanctioned scheme for which the suit land was to be utilized. Sh. Abdul Majid, learned counsel for the appellants, has also submitted that there is no prohibition in law for the Government to utilize the acquired land for any public purpose for which the same is acquired. Reliance has been placed by him on the case of Secretary of State v. Amulya Charan Banerjee and others (AIR 1927 Calcutta 874). There seems to be no prohibition in law for the Government to utilize land for any other purpose than for which originally it was intended, so long as the action is bona fide.""
The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners that Prime Minister has passed the order for de-notification of award No.19/98, hence, respondents are duty bound to implement the order of the Prime Minister in letter and spirit, has also no substance in it in the circumstances of this case. The similar proposition came under the consideration of the apex Court in case titled ""Administrator Municipal Committee Kotli and others v. Muhammad Abdullah and 3 others [2001 YLR 3367], wherein, it was observed that notification issued under section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act can only be canceled by notification as contemplated by section 21 of the General Clause Act, 1897 and mere order on an application is not sufficient to stop the acquisition proceedings. The relevant observation has been recorded in para No.7 as under: -
""From the survey of the case law, referred to above, we have reached the conclusion that the respondent who alleged the mala fides on the part of appellants failed not only to allege the same specifically but also failed to prove the same. Thus the notification issued by the Collector Land Acquisition under section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act couldn't be cancelled by the Prime Minister by passing an order on the application of respondent that the land may be defendant-awarded. In a case reported as Government of Punjab v. Sikandar Khan and others [PLD 1987 Peshawar 68] it was observed that in acquisition cases notification issued under section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act could be cancelled only by a notification as contemplated by section 21 of the General Clauses Act, 1897. Thus, the mere order on the application submitted by the respondent to Prime Minister that the land may be de-awarded is not sufficient in the eye of law to stop the acquisition proceedings initiated by the Collector Land acquisition.""
 In case titled ""Sajida Maqsood v. Azad Govt. and others"" [2012 YLR 1713] the apex Court while relying upon 2001 YLR 3367 supra, it was observed that mere order passed by the Prime Minister for de-awarding the land on sample application cannot carry the weight of Govt. order/notification. It was further observed that notification issued by Collector Land Acquisition cannot be cancelled by Prime Minister by passing order on the application that the land may be de-awarded.
 In view of the case law referred to hereinabove, it has become clear that the land acquired for public purpose can be used for other public purpose by the Government and order of the Prime Minister mere on the application for de-notification of the award issued by the Collector Land Acquisition does not carry the weight of Govt. notification/ order until it is cancelled by notification as contemplated by Section 21 of the General Clauses Act, 1897.
 Before parting with the case it may be stated that an application on behalf of Muhammad Shafiat Gellani and others for impleading them in line of the petitioners and another application on behalf of School Management Committee for impleading them in line of the respondents have been filed. No orders for their impleadment have been passed, however, the applicants have been heard under Rule 37 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir High Court Procedure Rules, 1984.
 The land in dispute has been acquired for public purpose and is useable as playground for the students, therefore, no writ can be issued for de-notify the same land. As per report of the commission the petitioners are in possession of the same land, therefore, the Collector Land Acquisition Hattian Bala shall take possession of the land and hand over the same to the school authorities. The petition stands disposed of in the manners indicated above.
ZC/21/HC(AJ&K)
 Order accordingly."

 FAHIM AHMED SIDDIQUI, J.---
The applicant has assailed the impugned judgment dated 27-1-2011 and decree dated 2-2-2011 passed by the Additional District Judge-I, Shikarpur in Civil Appeal No.34/2010 whereby allowing the appeal and setting aside the judgment and the decree of F.C. Suit No.70/2006 passed by the 1st Senior Civil Judge, Shikarpur. The result of the impugned judgment was that the suit filed by the applicant against the respondents was dismissed.
2.
 The facts of the case, as per Memo of instant civil revision are that the applicant filed a suit for declaration, permanent injunction and a mandatory injunction in respect of the agricultural land's measuring 2 -34 acres out of S. No. 432 (5-34), Deh Mahmooda, taluka Khanpur, district Shikarpur being suit land along with some other land belonging to Hindus. After migration of Hindus in India, the said land was allotted to claimant Kousar Ali Khan in the year 1972 by settlement department. The said land was later on purchased by the applicant in the year 1974. In the year 1981 another person namely Abdul Shakoor claimed to be allottee of the suit land along with some other survey numbers and record of rights was also changed in his favour. Thereafter the subsequent allottee Abdul Shakoor sold out the suit land to respondent Khan Muhammad. The applicant after coming to know about these subsequent developments, approached the concerned Deputy District Officer (Revenue), Shikarpur for cancellation of subsequent allotment, who directed him to approach the civil court for redressal of his grievance. However, the said Deputy District Officer (Revenue) directed the respondents Nos. 2 and 3 to stop payment of compensation of natural gas discovered in the suit land anybody including the respondent No. 8 (Khan Muhammad). The applicant then filed a civil suit before the court of first instance which was ultimately decreed in his favour. The respondent No.8 challenged the wording of the court of first instance in an appeal which was heard and decided against the applicant through the impugned judgment and decree.
3.
 The learned counsel for the applicant made his submission at length. According to him the land was allotted to claimant Kousar Ali Khan in the year 1972 and it cannot be re-allotted to anyone and the allotment to Abdul Shakoor is not proper. He submitted that the trial Court has decreed the suit after calling record and as per the statement of concerned official of Revenue Department, the record of rights was in the name of the original allottee Kousar Ali Khan and name of subsequent claimant Abdul Shakoor is not there and the claim file of the original claimant Kousar Ali Khan is available in the office. According to him, the suit was rightly decreed and the judgment and decree of the appellate court is misleading and contrary to law. He submitted that the chapter of allotment of evacuee property was closed under Settlement Act, as such it cannot be allotted to Abdul Shakoor.
4.
 Conversely, the learned counsel for the respondent No.8 submitted that the land is actually a settlement land and the same was rightly allotted to Abdul Shakoor who sold it out to the respondent No.8. According to him, the respondent No. 8 is in possession of the suit land and the applicant could not produce any document pertaining to suit land in his favour. He pointed out that the suit is not maintainable as the cause of action was beyond the period of limitation. He emphasized upon the propriety and correctness of the judgment of Appellate Court.
5.
 In the instant matter, now the land in question is no more available to enjoy the ownership by anyone of the parties. After discovery of the natural gas reservoirs, the said land has already been acquired to establish a gas field. Now the only question is to determine, who was the actual owner of the disputed land as such who is entitled for the compensation of acquiring proceedings. The said land was actually belonging to the Hindus and after their migration it was gone to the Custodian Department for the purpose of settlement of claimants of migrants from different parts of undivided India. It is the case of the applicant that he had purchased the land from the person whom it was allotted as claimant. As a plaintiff before the trial Court, the applicant tried to establish his claim by taking plea that he had purchased the property from the owner (whom it was allotted as claimant) from his attorney but he could not produce the original documents of the property including the power of attorney issued by the first claimant namely Kousar Ali Khan. After closure of the side of plaintiff (applicant), an official of Evacuee Property Branch of District Officer Revenue, Shikarpur was called as witness, who produced a Clearance Certificate, Parchee Taqseem Khatooni and Claim File in the name of Kousar Ali Khan. If these documents are accepted as gospel truth, even then at the most it can be said that sometime back in the year 1972, a claim of one Kousar Ali Khan was handled in the Department as no proper allotment in the name of allottee was produced. At the most, it can be said that a process was initiated but not completed, as neither it is established from the record that physical possession was handed over to him and/or any revenue was ever collected from him or on his behalf even the applicant could not produce a single 'Dhall Receipt' of the said property. It could also not be established by the applicant that the alleged allottee of the land in question has ever executed a 'Power of Attorney' to Mr. Ishrat Ali Khan from whom he allegedly purchased the land in question.
6.
 On the other hand, the respondent has produced all the relevant documents including the allotment of the land in the name of one Abdul Shakoor from whom he purchased the land. He had produced witness who supported the version of respondent before the trial Court. It has also come on the record that the respondent Khan Muhammad was declared by the authorities as owner and the compensation amount has already been paid to him. The learned Appellate Court has considered all these aspects in his well-reasoned judgment. It is worth noting that the compensation amount has been paid to respondent after inquiry, which is sufficient to substantiate the case of the genuineness of the ownership of the respondent. It has also come on record through the mouth of the witness of the respondent before the trial court that respondent has improved and developed the land to make it cultivable. It is also mentioned by him that he used to cultivate the land since mid 80s and pay the revenue of the land. On this point, this witness of the respondent was not controverted during cross-examination. The appellant was looking all these things but he did not bother to make a complaint. Since mid 80s to 2003, the appellant remained calm and did not put forth any claim. On this score alone, the case of appellant is liable to failure being badly hit by law of limitation.
7.
 The upshot of the above discussion is that the instant Civil Revision merits no consideration, hence dismissed, with no order as to cost.

 MIANGUL HASSAN AURANGZEB, J.---
Through the instant writ petition, the petitioner, Mansoor Ali, impugns the judgment and decree dated 09.01.2017, passed by the Court of the learned Additional District Judge, Islamabad, whereby the petitioner's appeal against the order and decree dated 18.11.2016, passed by the Court of the learned Rent Controller, Islamabad, was dismissed. Vide the said order and decree dated 18.11.2016, the learned Rent Controller allowed respondents No.3(a) to 3(f)s' petition under Section 17 of the Islamabad Rent Restriction Ordinance, 2001 (""IRRO"") seeking the petitioner's eviction from Basement Unit No.5, Plot No.15, G-9 Markaz, Islamabad (""the rented premises"").
2.
 The record shows that on 01.05.2004, Muhammad Saeed/ respondent No.3(a) entered into a lease agreement with Mansoor Ali (petitioner) whereunder the said rented premises were taken on rent by the petitioner for a period of two years (i.e. from 01.05.2004 to 30.04.2006). As per Clause-4 of the said lease agreement, after the expiry of two years, a fresh lease agreement was to be executed between the parties with mutual consent. It is an admitted position that after the expiry of the said two-year period, a fresh lease agreement was not executed. On 21.12.2013, Mst. Jamil Akhtar (who was respondent No.3(a)'s wife, and the owner of the rented premises), filed an eviction petition under Section 17 of the IRRO against the petitioner before the Court of the learned Rent Controller. The grounds taken in the said eviction petition were, (i) the expiry of the lease agreement, (ii) the unauthorized utilization of the rented premises, (iii) violation of the C.D.A.'s byelaws by the petitioner, and (iv) the owner's personal bona fide need for the rented premises. The petitioner contested the said eviction petition by filing a written reply. In the said reply, the petitioner admitted the existence of the relationship of landlord and tenant between Mst. Jamil Akhtar and the petitioner. Additionally, the petitioner did not deny Mst. Jamil Akhtar's pleading that she was the owner of the rented premises. During the pendency of the eviction petition, Mst. Jamil Akhtar died. Thereafter, an amended eviction petition was filed, wherein Mst. Jamil Akhtar's legal heirs (i.e. respondents No.3(a) to 3(f) were impleaded as petitioners in the said eviction petition. From the divergent pleadings of the parties, the learned Rent Controller, on 15.10.2014, framed the following issues:--
""1.
 Whether the lease agreement has been expired? OP Parties.
2.
 Whether the rented premises is required by the petitioner for the personal bona fide need? OPA
3.
 Whether the petitioner has no cause of action to file instant petition? OPR
4.
 Relief.""
3.
 Mst. Jamil Akhtar's son, Aamir Saeed (respondent No.3(d) herein), entered the witness box as AW-1 and submitted his affidavit-in-evidence as Exh.A1. The petitioner appeared as RW-1 and submitted his affidavit-in-evidence as Exh.R1. Vide order and decree dated 18.11.2016, the learned Rent Controller allowed the eviction petition and directed the petitioner to hand over possession of the rented premises within a period of thirty days. The said order and decree was impugned by the petitioner in an appeal before the Court of the learned Additional District Judge, Islamabad. Vide judgment and decree dated 09.01.2017, the learned Appellate Court dismissed the petitioner's appeal.
4.
 The learned Courts below concurrently held that the lease agreement dated 01.05.2004 had expired. It was also held that the eviction petitioners were successful in proving that the rented premises were required for their personal bona fide need. The petitioner in the instant writ petition has impugned the said concurrent judgments of the learned Courts below.
5.
 Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that under Clause-4 of the lease agreement dated 01.05.2004, the parties to the said agreement were supposed to execute a fresh lease agreement after the expiry of the initial lease period of two years; that despite the expiry of the said lease agreement, the landlord continued accepting the rent in accordance with the said lease agreement; that the eviction petition was initially filed by Mst. Jamil Akhtar, who was not a party to the lease agreement dated 01.05.2004; that respondent No.3(a), who executed the lease agreement, had filed an affidavit-in-evidence deposing on oath that he was Mst. Jamil Akhtar's special attorney; that respondent No.3(d), who had appeared as AW-1 was not a party to the lease agreement; that the petitioner in his affidavit-in-evidence had deposed that he was not respondent No.3(d)'s tenant; that respondent No.3(d), in his cross-examination, had deposed that the rented premises had earlier been vacated through the process of the Court by taking the ground of personal bona fide need; that after evicting the tenants from the rented premises, the landlord again rented out the rented premises; and that the respondents had other properties which they could utilize for their personal bona fide need. In support of his contention that a tenant cannot be evicted on the ground of the expiry of the lease agreement, the learned counsel for the petitioner placed reliance on the case of Mst. Munawar Sultana v. Additional District Judge, Islamabad, and others (2005 CLC 1119). Learned counsel for the petitioner also placed reliance on the case of Allies Book Corporation through legal heirs v. Sultan Ahmad and others (2006 SCMR 152). Learned counsel prayed for the concurrent orders passed by the learned Courts below to be set-aside.
6.
 On the other hand, learned counsel for respondents Nos.3(a) to 3(f) submitted that the petitioner in his written reply, filed before the learned Rent Controller, had admitted the relationship of landlord and tenant with the eviction petitioners; that Mst. Jamil Akhtar was the owner of the rented premises; that after her demise, her legal heirs were impleaded as petitioners in the eviction petition; that the lease agreement was executed between respondent No.3(a) (who is Mst. Jamil Akhtar's husband) and the petitioner; that respondent No.3(a) is a co-owner of the rented premises; that respondent No.3(d), (who is Mst. Jamil Akhtar and respondent No.3(a)'s son), is also a co-owner of the rented premises; that the rented premises were earlier vacated on the ground of personal bona fide need, but thereafter the owners had put the premises to their personal use by establishing an agency for cooking oil and rice; that given the definition of 'landlord' in Section 2(g) of the IRRO, Mst. Jamil Akhtar and her legal heirs come within the meaning of landlord; that the petitioner admits the execution of the lease agreement dated 01.05.2004; and that the petitioner entered the rented premises on the basis of the said lease agreement. Learned counsel prayed for the writ petition to be dismissed. In support of his contentions, the learned counsel for the respondents No.3(a) to 3(f) placed reliance on the cases of Asim Siddique Butt v. Muhammad Khursheed Mirza (2017 YLR Note 63), Jehangir Rustam Kakalia through legal heirs v. Messrs Hashwani Sales and Services (Pvt.) Limited (2002 SCMR 241), Najma Sultana through Attorney v. Anjuman Jamiat-ul-Akhwan and others (2017 YLR 164), and Bashir Ahmed through Special Attorney v. Mst. Fatima Begum and others (2017 YLR 453).
7.
 I have heard the contentions of the learned counsel for the contesting parties and have perused the record with their able assistance. The facts leading to the filing of the instant petition have been set out in sufficient detail in paragraphs 2 to 4 above, and need not be recapitulated.
8.
 The eviction petition was instituted by Mst. Jamil Akhtar (i.e. the owner of the rented premises) as early as 21.12.2013 (i.e. more than three years ago). During the pendency of the eviction petition, Mst. Jamil Akhtar passed away. Thereafter, her legal heirs were impleaded as petitioners in the eviction petition. The relationship of landlord and tenant between the contesting parties has not been denied. Admittedly, the petitioner's entry into the rented premises was on the basis of lease agreement dated 01.05.2004. The said lease agreement was entered into between the petitioner and respondent No.3(a), who was Mst. Jamil Akhtar's husband. The lease agreement between the parties had long expired. The petitioner, in his cross-examination, admitted that after the expiry of the lease agreement dated 01.05.2004, a fresh lease agreement was not executed.
9.
 Respondent No.3(d), who was Mst. Jamil Akhtar's son, and one of the co-owners of the rented premises gave evidence as AW-1. Respondent No.3(d), in his cross-examination, did not deny that earlier the landlord had rented premises vacated on the ground of personal bona fide need, but it has also been deposed that after the rented premises were vacated by the earlier tenant, the same was used by landlord for the business of an agency for cooking oil and rice by the name of ""Pak Traders"". It was also deposed that this business continued for a year and a half after which the rented premises were again rented out. Therefore, it is my view that the owners of the rented premises could institute an eviction petition against the petitioner on the ground of personal bona fide need for the said premises.
10.
 It is also not denied that in addition to the rented premises, the landlords had other commercial properties, but it is well-settled that it is the landlord's unfettered choice as to which of his properties he puts to his personal use. It does not lie in the mouth of the tenant to say that the landlord should use any other of his properties for his personal use. Even the Rent Controller does not have the authority to determine the property which the landlord should put to his own personal use. A landlord is not even required to mention in the eviction petition or in his evidence, the nature of business he wants to carry out at the rented premises. In the case of Pakistan Institute of International Affairs v. Naveed Merchant (2012 SCMR 1498), it has been held that the choice lies with the landlord to select any of the tenement for his personal need and for this purpose the tenant has no locus standi to give advice to the landlord to use alternate accommodation. In the case of S.M. Nooruddin v. Saga Printers (1998 SCMR 2119), it has been observed that a landlord has a complete option to choose from one of the several tenements occupied by tenants for his personal requirement and the discretion is not assailable, except in the rarest cases of bad faith. Furthermore, this Court, in the case of Javaid Ahmed v. Muhammad Imran Malik (PLD 2011 Islamabad 30), it has been held as follows:--
""11. Now adverting to the contention that respondents Nos.1 and 2 are owners of other shop, suffice it to say that it is settled law that it is the prerogative of the landlord to choose premises for his personal need and no discretion in respect thereof can be given to the landlord and in this respect reliance is placed upon the case of Malik Muhammad Ramzan v. Messrs General Iron Stores and another (1995 SCMR 1125), wherein it has been held that ""landlord"" would have privilege to choose anyone of his properties for self-use, considered by him suitable for his requirement, provided his need was not tainted with mala fide. Further in the case National Tubewell Construction Corporation Ltd. v. Tariq Rahim (Advocate) and another (NLR 1991 Civil 366), it has been observed that it is for landlord to choose and make a choice as to which of his properties is suitable to meet his needs/requirements and tenant cannot dictate to landlord that he should occupy this property or that property or that he should move for eviction against this tenant or that tenant.""
11.
 As mentioned above, Respondent No.3(d) entered the witness box as AW-1 and deposed that the rented premises were required to be used as a clinic by his wife, who was a doctor. Respondent No.3(d)'s said stance was not shaken in his cross-examination. Respondent No.3(d), in his cross-examination, had deposed that he had got married in 1998; that his wife was doctor before they got married; and that she continued to work as a doctor after their marriage. In the eviction petition, it has been clearly pleaded that respondent No.3(d)'s wife was a Senior Registrar in the Radiology Department of Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, Islamabad; and that the rented premises were required to be used by respondent No.3(d)'s wife as a clinic. There was no inconsistency between the averments in the eviction petition and the evidence adduced by respondent No.3(d). It is well settled that the sole statement of the landlord regarding the personal bona fide need for the rented premises was sufficient for the eviction of the tenant. In the case of Iqbal Book Depot v. Khitab Ahmed (2001 SCMR 1197), it has been held the where the statement of the landlord on oath was consistent with his averments in the ejectment application and the same had neither been shaken nor had anything been brought in evidence to contradict the statement, such a statement would be considered sufficient for the acceptance of the ejectment application.
12.
 The petitioner, in his affidavit-in-evidence, has deposed that he is not respondent No.3(d)'s tenant, but that of his parents. It was also deposed that the petitioner was regularly paying rent. Now, on account of Mst. Jamil Akhtar's demise, both respondent No.3(a) and respondent No.3(d) have become co-owners of the rented premises. Therefore, they were both competent, jointly or severally to institute or pursue the eviction proceedings against the petitioner. The term ""landlord"" has been defined in Section 2 (g) of the IRRO in the following terms:--
""""landlord"" means the owner of the premises and includes any person for the time being authorized or entitled to receive rent in respect of any building or rented land, whether on his own account or on behalf, or for the benefit, of any other person, or as a trustee, guardian or receiver, and or a tenant who, being authorized under the terms of his lease so to do, sublets the building and every other person for the time being deriving title from the landlord;""
 (Emphasis added)
13.
 Since it is not disputed that Mst. Jamil Akhtar was the owner of the rented premises, there was no legal impediment before her to have instituted an eviction petition. After her demise during the pendency of the eviction petition, her legal heirs were brought on record. One of her legal heirs was her husband/respondent No.3(a), who had executed the lease agreement dated 01.05.2004, with the petitioner.
14.
 Under Section 17(5) of the IRRO, the Rent Controller has to satisfy himself about the bona fides of the landlord's claim regarding his requirement for his own occupation of the rented premises in good faith. The learned Courts below happen to be concurrently satisfied as to the eviction petitioners' bona fides regarding the said claim. There is no convincing material before me to doubt the satisfaction of the learned Courts below as to the eviction petitioners' bona fides. In the event, the rented premises are not occupied by the eviction petitioners or by any of their family members, Section 17(6) of the IRRO gives ample protection to the petitioner. For ready reference the said Section 17(6) is reproduced herein below:--
""17(6). Where the landlord who has obtained possession of a building in pursuance of an order made under subsection (5) does not himself, or where possession of the building or rented land has been obtained for any member of his family such member does not, occupy the building or rented land within one month of the date of obtaining or rented land within one month of the date of obtaining its possession, or having obtained possession relets it within six months of the said date to any person other than the tenant, the tenant may apply to the Controller for an order directing that the possession of such building be restored to him and the Controller may make an order accordingly.""
15.
 By reason of the above, without going into the question whether the expiry of a lease is a ground under the IRRO to seek the eviction of a tenant, I am of the view that the learned Courts below correctly allowed the eviction petition on the ground of landlords' bona fide need for the rented premises. Resultantly, this writ petition is dismissed with no order as to costs.

 SALAHUDDIN PANHWAR, J.---
Through instant criminal revision application, applicants have challenged the concurrent findings
recorded by trial Court as well appellate Court, whereby applicants have been convicted for one year rigorous imprisonment.
2.
 Case of the prosecution is that one UTP namely Muhammad Ramzan, due to urinal pain was referred to Civil Hospital Sanghar and he was admitted by the hospital administration. On 24.09.2007, on visit, doctor found him missing hence, the matter was reported to the concerned police thereby these four applicants were arraigned.
3.
 Learned counsel for the applicants at the outset, has contended that there is no proof that applicants were on duty on the fateful day. He referred to the evidence of complainant who, in his cross-examination, admits that ""it is correct to suggest that on that day HC Ali Muhammad was doing duty at police line on telephone and roznamcha. It is correct to suggest that I and WHC Abdul Hameed were not present in office at night on that day."" Whereas learned APG while supporting the impugned judgments contends that one witness has deposed that present police officials were on duty; however, that entry is not produced on record. He refers to evidence of PW-5, who is Jail Superintendent and stated that UTP was referred to hospital due to urinal tract problem, however, he has not produced any document with regard to negligence on the part of any of the applicants.
4.
 I have heard the respective sides and have also carefully gone through the available record.
5.
 Case of the prosecution is that on 24.09.2007, UTP escaped from Ward of Hospital and present applicants were held guilty of negligence resulted into such escape. I have no confusion in my mind that the offence wherein the applicants have been convicted is of two folds. The first one is that such public servant must have been legally bound to keep escaped person in confinement and second one is that escape must have been due to negligence of such public servant. In such like cases the prosecution must establish first one while the burden would be upon public servant to disprove the second fold that escape was not result of his negligence. In the instant matter, nothing was brought on record with regard to duty of present applicants over the escaped accused or at such place. The duties of police officials, including that of jail are regulated under entries in relevant record (registers) hence prosecution was required to have produced such entries on record but it is a matter of record that no such entry or proof has been brought on record. In absence thereof, the conviction for such an offence cannot sustain. Both the Courts below erred in law while not appreciating the well settled principle of law that for giving benefit of doubt to an accused more than one infirmity is not required but a single infirmity creating reasonable doubt is sufficient. (Muhammad Luqman v. The State PLD 1970 SC 10).
 Accordingly, this case is not free from doubt; as a result of which, impugned judgments dated 31.10.2009 and 01.04.2014 are hereby set aside. Applicants are acquitted of the charge by giving benefit of doubt. They are present on bail. Their bail bonds are cancelled and surety stand discharged.

MUHAMMAD SHERAZ KIANI, J.---
The captioned application has been filed under section 561-A of Cr.P.C. for quashment of FIR illat No. 30/17 lodged on 13.02.2017 at Police Station Charhoi in offences under sections 109, 511, APC against the applicant.
2.
 Precise grievance of the applicant in the instant application is that it is averred that on a concocted and fabricated story the case mentioned above, has been registered against the accused to humiliate him in the society whereas the contents of initial report of police do not disclose commission of any offence. It is stated therein that the report has been prepared on the basis of personal rivalry and political influence and the complainant party implicated the applicant with the commission of offence while no piece of evidence has been brought on record which may suggest that the applicant remained connected with commission of offence. It is averred that it is crystal clear from the report that the deceased, Aliza Zaroob, was rusticated by School Principal accused-Sahadat Rafique whereas in the aforesaid report, only the role of making telephonic call has been attributed against the applicant and at that time when the incident took place, he was at Kotli with his close relative. It is craved that the accused-applicant neither made a telephonic call to the deceased nor has any nexus with her. It is contended that the report resulting into registration of case made due to political influence just to bring into disrepute the accused-applicant in the general public, therefore, same is liable to be quashed to meet the ends of justice.
3.
 On application, the non-applicants were summoned for filing comments vide order dated 13.03.2017, the needful was done by the official respondents on 29.03.2017 wherein the contents given in the application have been refuted entirely and it is stated that the accused-applicant is nominated in the aforesaid case and specific role has been attributed against him and the accused-person is fully implicated with the commission of offence because it appears from the initial investigation, no clue of personal rivalry between the complainant party and the accused-applicant becomes visible and if the proceedings of the case going on are stopped or the investigation is restrained, the complainant party will suffer an irreparable loss and the investigating agency may not reach the real culprits. It is contended therein that the accused-applicant indulged in blackmailing and harassing the deceased, which is corroborated through Mobile Telephonic Prints (CDR) and mobile data record, therefore, the application may be dismissed so that the investigation may be completed and the case be submitted before the competent Court of law.
3(sic.) Learned counsel for accused applicants reiterated the grounds taken in the applications and submitted that from the perusal of the FIR no cognizable offence appears to have been committed. He submitted that FIR was registered after 25 days of occurrence which is clear proof of the fact that the case is false and FIR has been registered with mala fide intentions. The learned counsel further argued that the occurrence in respect of which the complainant has been lodged, is in fact a suicide; therefore, the FIR may be quashed on the ground that the same has been registered illegally against the accused-applicant.
4.
 On the other side, it was argued that the accused petitioners made telephonic calls to the deceased and teased her, upon which she was depressed and lastly she committed suicide, thus the accused petitioner and others were responsible for her death. The matter is still under investigation. Material brought on record is sufficient to connect the accused petitioner with the alleged offence, and there was no justification to quash FIR, therefore, the application may be dismissed.
5.
 I have heard the learned counsel for parties and learned Assistant Advocate General representing the State and gone through the record of the case.
6.
 For having true perception, I would like to reproduce section 561-A, Cr.P.C., which is as under:-
""561/A, Cr.P.C.
 Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent power of the High Court to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under this Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice.""
7.
 It is well settled that the inherent jurisdiction of this Court under section 561-A, Cr.P.C. is neither alternative nor additional in its character and is to be rarely invoked only in the interest of justice so as to seek redress of grievance for which no other procedure is available and that the provision should not be used to obstruct or divert the ordinary course of criminal procedure. Section 561-A, Cr.P.C. confers upon this Court inherent powers to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under this Code or to prevent abuse of process of any Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. These powers are very wide and can be exercised by this Court at any time.
8.
 Now the question arises that if the story narrated in the police record is presumed to be correct than whether any cognizance offence has been committed or not?
9.
 The contention of Learned Assistant Advocate General that due to teasing and harassment by the accused Mohsin Hanif and others, the deceased became so depressed that she could not control her senses and thus died due to unlawful and illegal act of the accused persons, and according to his version thus, accused are responsible of her death, does not carry weight because to bring the case of the accused into offence of Qatl-i-amd, Qatl-shibh-i-amd, Qatl-i-Khata, and Qatl-bis-Sabab, necessary factors which are required, are that there must be direct links between act or omission of the accused person and death of the deceased. In simple words cause of death must be attributed towards the accused person. For proper perception it would be useful to reproduce the definition of the above kinds of murders given in the A.P.C.
Section 300, A.P.C. ""Qatl-i-amd.
 Whoever, with the intention of causing death or with the intention of causing bodily injury to a person by doing an act which in the ordinary course of nature is likely to cause death, or with the knowledge that his act is so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death.
315, A.P.C. Qatl Shibh-i-amd
. Whoever, with intent to cause harm to the body or mind of any person causes the death of that or of any other person by means of a weapon of an act which in the ordinary course of nature is not likely to cause death is said to commit qatl shibh-i-amd.
318, A.P.C, Qatl-i-Khata---
Whoever, without any intention to cause the death of, or cause harm to a person, causes death of such person, either by mistake of act or by mistake of fact, is said to commit qatl-i-Khata.
321, A.P.C, Qatl-Bis-Sabab
. Whoever, without any intention to cause death of, or cause harm to, any person, does any unlawful act which becomes a cause for the death of another person, is said to commit qatl-bis-Sabab.
10.
 According to the definition of murder there must be an intention to kill someone and an act which in ordinary course of nature can cause death or the offender himself should have a knowledge that his act is so imminently dangerous that in all probabilities it would result in the death of the victim. For qatl-bis-sabab, there must be unlawful act which could be direct cause of death of the deceased but in the present case if it is presumed that the accused persons have teased or harassed the deceased (Aliza Zaroob) and from their alleged acts she became so depressed, resultantly she herself jumped down in the deep ditch/chasm and died. From these facts one can say that due to unlawful act of the accused person she suffered from depression but her death cannot be related with these acts and it cannot be said that her death was caused due to alleged act of the accused person. From the facts narrated in the FIR, intention to kill the deceased cannot be gathered, neither it can be said, even prima facie, that if a person is teased or expelled from school/college, he would commit suicide consequently. For qatl -bis-sabab, even, the unlawful act of the offender must be a direct cause of the death of a person though intention is not necessary in that case. Needless to say that suicide is committed by a person due to any mental disorder (anxiety, depression etc) and cause of depression can be determined by a psychologist/psychiatrist, just to presume that a specific incident is a cause would not be legally justified. Even for the sake of argument, if it is presumed that the attributed acts of the accused persons were the cause of her anxiety, even then one can say that due to their alleged acts she became so depressed, and thereafter she committed suicide. So it could be the cause of depression not of death and to constitute a cognizable offence of qatl one must be attributed an act which would be a direct cause of death which is missing in the present case. If such practice is allowed every suicidal death would be converted into a murder case by the Police by roping in the other people socially connected with the deceased. It is clear from the Police record that victim (Aliza Zaroob) committed suicide. If the facts of the case do not disclose or constitute any offence, then to allow the proceedings to continue amounts to abuse of process of the Court and its pendency cannot be allowed to be used as an instrument of harassment or coercion for attainment of unlawful purpose. In the instant case FIR had been lodged after about 25 days of the occurrence. It is clear that registration of FIR has been resorted as vehicle of oppression and coercion against the petitioner/accused which will cause abuse of process of the Court.
11.
 The FIR has been registered under sections 511/109, A.P.C. The both sections applies in case of abetment or attempt to commit, if made out. The learned counsel for the complainant could not be able to point out what offence was abetted or attempted. According to column 3 of schedule II given in Criminal Procedure Code, the both offences (abetment and attempt) becomes cognizable only when the main of fence(attempted or abetted) is cognizable, when there is no mention of any abetted or attempted offence (murder etc) then to register case under sections 511/109, A.P.C. is without lawful authority. Thus in these circumstances the offences as alleged in the FIR are not made out against the accused and continuance of the proceedings in the case in hand, would amount to abuse of the process of the Court and would be a futile exercise and wastage of time.
11(sic.) As no cognizable offence is made out, but as far the alleged acts of the accused that they teased, harassed or abused the deceased during her life time, is concerned, it can constitute some non cognizable offence and in view of section 155(1), Cr.P.C. the Police can forward the complainant to the concerned magistrate or he can file a private complaint against the accused persons. If any investigation is required, that can be done by Police under subsection (2) of section 155, Cr.P.C. after obtaining permission of the competent Magistrate that too without power of Police to arrest the accused.
 Therefore, in this view of the matter, I accept this petition and the FIR illat No.30/2017 registered at police station Chrohi on 09.03.2017 in offences under sections 511/109, A.P.C. is hereby quashed.

 This constitutional petition has been directed against judgment dated 18.02.2017 passed by learned Additional District Judge, Lahore whereby order dated 25.06.2016 passed by Guardian Judge, Lahore was set aside.
2.
 Precisely, the facts of the case are that respondent No.2 (father) filed a petition under Section 25 of the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 against the petitioner for the custody of minor children along with an application for the grant of visitation rights under the provision of Section 12 of the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890. Guardian Judge allowed the visitation rights to the respondent-father to meet the children on every first and third Saturday of every month starting from 11:00 a.m. till 01:00 P.M. in the Court premises vide order dated 03.06.2015. Respondent No.2 again filed an application under Section 12 of the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890. Learned Guardian Judge vide order dated 25.06.2016, partially accepted the application for handing over the interim custody of the minors to the respondent No.2 during the summer vacations from 11.07.2016 to 11.08.2016. Feeling aggrieved, respondent No.2 filed an appeal before learned Additional District Judge who vide impugned order dated 18.02.2017 chalked out the following schedule:-
""(i)
 The interim custody of the minors shall be handed over to the petitioner on 2nd and 4th Saturday of every calendar month at 05:00 PM and petitioner shall return the interim custody of the minors to the respondent on 2nd and 4th Sunday at 05:00 P.M.
(ii)
 On the occasion of Eid ul Fitar the petitioner/father shall be entitled for interim custody of the minors on 2nd Day of Eid ul Fitar from 5:00 P.M and petitioner shall return the interim custody of the minors to the respondent on the 3rd Day of Eid ul Fitar at 5:00 PM.
(iii)
 On the occasion of Eid ul Azha the petitioner/father shall be entitled for interim custody of the minors on 2nd Day of Eid ul Azha from 5:00 PM and petitioner shall return the interim custody of the minors to the respondent on the 3rd Day of Eid ul Azha at 5:00 PM.
(iv)
 On the occasion of birthday of the minors the petitioner/father shall be entitled for interim custody of the minors from 5:00 PM and petitioner shall return the interim custody of the minors to the respondent on the next day of birthday of the minors at 05: PM.
(v)
 On the occasion of birthday of father of the minors petitioner/father shall be entitled for interim custody of the minors from 05:00 PM and petitioner/father shall return the interim custody of the minors to the respondent on the next day of birthday of father of the minor at 05:00 PM.
During summer vacations, the appellant will be entitled to meet with his minor children for one month. During spring vacations, he will be entitled to meet with his minor children for half of the vacations. During winter vacations, he will be entitled to meet with his minor children for five days. During Moharram ul Haram, he will also be entitled to meet with his minor children on 9th Moharram ul Haram at 11:00 A.M. and appellant shall return back custody of minors the respondent / mother on next day at 11:00 AM. All the above said meeting will be subject to submission of surety bonds and fee payable to the bailiff: ""
Feeling aggrieved, petitioner has filed the present constitutional petition.
3.
 Learned counsel for the petitioner has mainly argued that in terms of Section 14(3) appeal before the learned District Judge was incompetent; therefore, impugned order is coram non judice, without jurisdiction. In this regard, he has relied on ""Mst. Sabira Sultana v. Asif Firdous"" (2011 YLR 1543), ""Shamim Ara v. Bakhtawar Gul and 2 others"" (2012 CLC 1881). Learned counsel for the petitioner further argued that lower appellate Court has failed to appreciate, while passing the impugned order dated 18.02.2017 that any order in the presence of order dated 03.06.2015 regarding chalking out the schedule of meeting in accordance with the wishes of respondent No.2 would amount to review of earlier order dated 03.06.2015 after lapse of more than 1 year and 8 months, which is certainly not warranted by law as the same had attained finality and respondent No.2 has not challenged the same at any forum. Contends that in terms of Section 47 of Guardians and Wards Act order passed under Section 12 is not appealable. Moreover, impugned judgment is contrary to law and is liable to be set aside.
4.
 On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent No.2 has vehemently opposed the contentions advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioner mainly on the ground that Provisions of Guardians and Wards Act cannot be read in isolation and combined reading of Family Courts Act will lead to a conclusion that in fact Section 14 of the Family Courts Act provides that decision given under Family Courts Act is appealable. Contends that impugned order under Section 12 passed by Judge Family Court was not interim in nature. Further contends that appeal filed by respondent No.2 before the Additional District Judge was fully competent. Submits that Guardian Judge under the Family Courts Act is exclusively governed by said Act and can exercise powers to modify or review the order which was earlier passed. In this regard learned counsel for respondent No.2 has placed reliance on ""Dr. Kiran Qadir v. Maj. Dr. Muhammad Ali Yousaf Khan"" (PLD 2014 Lahore 17), ""Abdul Hameed v. Mst. Shabnam alias Shabana and 2 others"" (PLD 2014 Balochistan 39) and ""Muhammad Anwar Khan v. Mst. Yasmin Zafar"" (1987 SCMR 2029).
5.
 Arguments heard. Record perused.
6.
 Primary question involved in this case is that as to whether an appeal is competent before the District Judge against order dated 25.06.2016 passed by Guardian Judge under Section 12 of the Guardians and Wards Act whereby Guardian Judge partially accepted the application for handing over the interim custody of the minors to the respondent No.2 during the summer vacations from 11.07.2016 to 11.08.2016. Much emphases has been laid by the counsel for the petitioner that in terms of Section 5 of the Family Courts Act, 1964, Part-I of the schedule includes matters relating to the Guardianship, therefore, all such matters pertaining to the Guardianship shall be governed by the said Act and in that context Section 14(3) imposes a restriction upon filing an appeal against an interim order. He has relied on Section 47 of the Guardians and Wards Act which according to the learned counsel for the petitioner does not provide the remedy of appeal. For facility of reference Section 5 of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 is reproduced as under: 
5.

Section 14(3) of Act ibid is reproduced herein below:-
Appeals
.--- (1) Notwithstanding anything provided in any other law for the time being in force, a decision given or a decree passed by a Family Court shall be appealable---
(a)
 to the High Court, where the Family Court is presided over by a District Judge, an Additional District Judge or a person notified by Government to be of the rank and status of a District Judge or an Additional District Judge; and

(c)
 for maintenance of rupees [five thousand] or less per month.
(3)
 No appeal or revision shall lie against an interim order passed by a Family Court.
(4)
 The appellate Court referred to in sub section (1) shall dispose of the appeal within a period of four months.]
Section 47 of Guardians and Wards Act is reproduced as under:-
47.
 Orders appealable.
 An appeal shall lie to the High Court from an order made by a Court :-
(a)
 under Section 7, appointing or declaring to appoint or declare a guardian ; or
(b)
 under Section 9, subsection (3), returning an application ; or
(c)
 under Section 25, making or refusing to make an order for the return of a ward to the custody and of his guardian ; or
(d)
 under Section 26, refusing leave for the removal of a ward from the limits of the jurisdiction of the Court, or imposing conditions with respect thereto ; or
(e)
 under Section 28 or Section 29, refusing permission to a guardian to do an act referred to in the section; or
(f)
 under Section 32 defining, restricting or extending the powers of a guardian ; or
(g)

(h)
 under Section 42, refusing to discharge a guardian ; or
(i)

(j)
 under Section 44, imposing a penalty: [Provided that, where the order from which an appeal is preferred is passed by an officer subordinate to a District Court, the appeal shall lie to the District Court'
7.
 At the first instance, it is observed that provisions of Guardians and Wards Act cannot be read in isolation because the legislature by design has brought the disputes relating to the guardianship, within the purview of First Schedule of Section 5 of the Family Courts Act, therefore, all the affairs relating to the Guardianship shall be exclusively triable by the Family Court under the Act ibid.
8.
 It is settled principle of interpretation of statutes that the statute which is later in time shall prevail. Reliance is placed on ""Messrs Mehraj Flour Mills and others v. Provincial Government and others"" (2001 SCMR 1806), ""Suo Motu Case No.13 of 2007""(PLD 2009 SC 217) and ""Aley Nabi and others v. Chairman, Sindh Labour Court and another ""(1993 SCMR 328),
9.
 So far as Section 14(3) regarding the maintainability of the appeal before the Additional District Judge is concerned, plain reading of language of Section 14 makes it abundantly clear that notwithstanding anything provided in any other law for the time being enforce a decision given or a decree shall be appealable. The only exclusion is with regard to an interim order. Now the question before this Court is as to whether order dated 25.06.2016 passed by learned Guardian Judge/Judge Family Court under Section 12 of the Guardians and Wards Act was a decision or an interim order. This Court while confronted with the similar situation had already pronounced that such order falls within the purview of ""decision given"" and is appealable under Section 14 of Family Courts Act, 1964. Reliance is placed on ""Mst. Zaibun Nisa v. Muhammad Mozammil"" (PLD 1972 Karachi 410). In another pronouncement ""Syed Shamim Ahmad v. Mst. Riaz Fatima"" (PLD 1975 Karachi 448), it was observed that expressions or decisions given in Section 14 are not in any manner qualified by any such word as final, and therefore, an order under Section 12 is a decision given and is appealable. Further reliance has been placed on ""Muhammad Deen Malik and another v. IInd Additional District Judge, Karachi and 2 others"" (1982 SCMR 1223) and ""Sakhawat Ali and another v. Mst. Shui Khelay"" (PLD 1981 Supreme Court 454)
10.
 Learned counsel for the petitioner has relied on ""Mst. Sabira Sultana v. Asif Firdous"" (2011 YLR 1453). This judgment does not relate to a case of Guardianship and is a dispute pertaining to maintainability of appeals against an order passed in a suit for maintenance under Section 17-B which was under discussion, therefore, this judgment is inapt.
11.
 In view of the above, it can safely be concluded that the impugned judgment passed by Addl. District Judge was well within jurisdiction of the lower appellate Court.
12.
 So far as the argument of learned counsel for the petitioner that family Court could not pass the order dated 25.06.2016 whereby application filed by respondent No.2 for handing over custody of the minor during the summer vacations was illegal on the ground that when the application already decided no fresh application could be entertained. In this regard, it is observed that the Guardian Judge exercises a parental jurisdiction and there is no scope of such jurisdiction for any undue adherence to technicalities. Separate application can be made on fresh grounds. Reliance is placed on ""Malik Khizer Hayat Khan Tiwana and another v. Mst. Zainab Begum"" (PLD 1967 SC 402).
13.
 It has been categorically laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court that the Family Court is a quasi-judicial forum which could draw and follow its own procedure provided such procedure is not against the principles of fair hearing and trial. Reliance is placed on ""Muhammad Tabish Naeem Khan v. Additional District Judge, Lahore and others"" (2014 SCMR 1365), relevant portion is reproduced herein below:-
""Family Court empowered to strike off defendant's defence and pass ex parte decree---Scope---Family Court was a quasi-judicial forum, which could draw and follow its own procedure, provided such procedure was not against the principles of fair hearing and trial""
14.
 So far as the merits of the case are concerned, suffice it so to say that this Court under the constitutional jurisdiction cannot substitute the findings of the appellate Court. It is well established principle that powers of judicial review of this Court are not analogues to those of appellate Court, reason being that appellate Court is final Court for determination of question of fact. Purpose of the Family Courts is to resolve the family disputes expeditiously and in order to save the parties from ordeal of litigation and to curb the mischief of delaying tactics.
15.
 By now it has become an established law with particular reference to Family Courts Act, 1964 that interference under the constitutional jurisdiction is permissible only in case of any jurisdictional defect or legal infirmity which does not exist in the present case.
 What has been discussed above, this Court is not persuaded to interfere in the impugned judgment, this petition is dismissed.

 KHADIM HUSSAIN M. SHAIKH, J.---
This civil revision application is directed against the judgment dated 17.09.2009 and decree dated 19.09.2009, passed by the II-Additional District Judge, Khairpur in Civil Appeal No.55 of 2009 re-Hafeez Ahmed and others v. His Highness Mir Ali Murad Khan Talpur and others, whereby the said appeal filed against the order dated 30.05.2009 and decree dated 04.06.2009, passed by the 1st Senior Civil Judge, rejecting the plaint of the suit being F.C. Suit No.21 of 2007 re-Hafeez Ahmed and others v. His Highness Mir Ali Murad Khan Talpur and others, has been dismissed.
2.
 Briefly the facts of the case are that in the year 2007 applicant Hafeez Ahmed and two others had filed suit being F.C. Suit No.21 of 2007 re-Hafeez Ahmed and others v. His Highnees Mir Ali Murad Khan Talpur and others, for declaration, possession, mesne profits and permanent injunction in the Court of II-Senior Civil Judge Khairpur. The case of the plaintiffs (hereinafter will be referred to as the applicants) as set out in their plaint is that the applicants filed ""F.C. Suit No.293 of 2006 re-Hafeez Ahmed and others v. His Highness Mir Ali Murad Khan"" (against the respondent No.1) in the Court of 1st Senior Civil Judge, Khairpur, which was withdrawn by the applicants with permission to file afresh vide order dated 24.2.2007 and then the applicants filed the present suit. The applicants alleged that Her Highness Jr. Iqbal Begum and Ghulam Muhammad alias Bugo were full owners in equal shares of the 50 paisas each in the land described in the plaint (hereinafter will be referred as the disputed land), situated in deh Nizamani, Taluka and District Khairpur, on basis of the registered sale deed dated 15.10.1929. Vide order dated 28.8.1936, the record of the rights was mutated in names of Her Highness Jr.Iqbal Begum and Ghulam Muhammad alias Bugo. It is alleged that Her Highness Jr.Iqbal Begum transferred her share in favour of the applicants and Muhammad Iqbal vide registered sale deed dated 10.08.1966. Ghulam Muhammad alias Bugo expired leaving behind the applicants and Muhammad Iqbal as sons, who inherited his share in the disputed land and the record of rights was mutated in names of the applicants and Muhammad Iqbal. It is alleged that Muhammad Iqbal transferred his share in the disputed land to the applicants vide registered sale deed dated 22.04.1994 and the names of the applicants were mutated in record of rights, who were in peaceful possession and enjoyment of the disputed land. It is further alleged that the applicant No.1, who was looking after the disputed land, went to United States of America in the year 1997 to look after and educate his children, when the respondent No.1 forcibly occupied the disputed land in the year 1997 taking advantage of absence of the applicant No.1 and managed letter No.Rev/8146, dated 19.12.2000 issued by the respondent No.2, on the basis whereof fabricated the revenue record in his favour vide order dated 10.02.2001, passed by the respondent No.3. The respondent No.1 gave no heed to the murmur and repine of the applicants, who in order to set the record of rights approached the respondent No.1 and made submissions to him to consider about his stature and hand over possession of the disputed land to them. The applicants then made the Commissioner, Sukkur, Division, Sukkur, aware of the letter dated 19.12.2000, issued by the respondent No.2 and order dated 10.02.2001 passed by the respondent No.3, who while exercising suo motu powers cancelled the letter dated 19.12.2000 and order dated 10.02.2001 vide order dated 24.2 (year not mentioned). The respondent No.1 filed F.C. Suit No.286 of 2006, re-His Highness Mir Ali Murad Khan v. Province of Sindh and others, for declaration, mandatory injunction and permanent injunction against the public functionaries. As the respondent No.1 on basis of the muscle and gun power started raising construction of the boundary wall around the disputed land to strengthen his illegal possession, hence the necessity arose to the applicants to file F.C. Suit No.293 of 2006 re-Hafeez Ahmed and others v. His Highness Mir Ali Murad Khan Talpur in the Court of 1st Senior Civil Judge, Khairpur, which was withdrawn by the applicants with permission to file fresh suit vide order dated 24.2.2007. The respondent No.1 filed ""Case No. SROR 137 of 2006 titled Mir Ali Murad Khan Talpur v. Hafeez Ahmed Butt and others"" against the applicants and others, during the pendency of the above suits before the respondent No.5, who allowed the aforementioned Case without waiting for the decision of the suits and Misc. applications filed in the suits, in order to favour the respondent No.1, vide impugned order dated 03.02.2007 against the order dated 24.2 (year not mentioned). The claim of the respondent No.1 over the disputed land is illegal and unwarranted under the law, as such, the necessity arose to the applicants to file the above suit. The respondent No.1 filed application under Order VII Rule 10, read with Rule 11, C.P.C. The learned trial Court rejected the plaint vide impugned order dated 30.09.2009 and decree dated 04.06.2009. The applicants filed the appeal which was dismissed vide impugned judgment dated 17.09.2009 and decree dated 19.09.2009 by the find Additional District Judge, Khairpur, hence this revision application.
3.
 None is present for the applicant. Same was the position on the last date of hearing viz. 20.01.2017. This matter besides an old matter pertaining to the year 2009, is also a fast track case and as such, lastly, as an indulgence and in the interest of justice the matter was adjourned with the directions to the learned counsel for the parties to proceed with the matter on the next date of hearing with the caution that in case none appears for either of the parties and/or fails to proceed with the matter, the case will be heard and decided on the basis of material available on record. No one has shown his appearance for the applicants to address the arguments on their behalf. Heard learned counsel for the respondent No.1 and the learned Asst. A.G.
4.
 The learned advocate for the respondent No.1 has mainly contended that the plaint of the subject suit did not disclose any cause of action; that the suit filed by the plaintiffs/applicants was also barred under the provisions of Section 11 of Code of Civil Procedure 1908; that the plaint of the subject suit filed by the applicants was rightly rejected by the learned Court of Senior Civil Judge and the appeal filed by the applicants against the order and decree, rejecting the plaint, has also been dismissed by the appellate Court after going through the pleadings and the material placed on record; and, that there are concurrent orders by both the learned Courts below. He, therefore, prays that the instant revision application may be dismissed with costs. He has placed his reliance on the cases of S.M. Shafi Ahmad Zaidi v. Hassan Ali Khan (2002 SCMR 338), Imtiaz Hussain v. Government of Pakistan (1992 CLC 1122), Haji Nek Mohammad v. Province of West Pakistan and 12 others (PLD 1966 (W.P.) Karachi 314, Province of West Pakistan v. Haji Muhammad Juman and another (PLD 1960 (W.P) Karachi 908), Rais Dil Murad Khan v. Ali Nawaz and others (1997 MLD 1309), Alam Sher through Legal Heirs v. Muhammad Sharif and 2 others (1998 SCMR 468) and Ghulam Muhammad v. Mst. Rasoolan Bibi (1996 MLD 256).
5.
 The learned Assistant Advocate General supporting the arguments of learned counsel for the respondent No.1, further submits that since there are concurrent findings of the learned Courts below for rejecting the plaint of the subject suit based on the valid reasons, therefore, the same may be maintained.
6.
 I have considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the respondent No.1 and learned Asst. A.G and have also gone through the material available on record.
7.
 In order to appreciate the case of the applicants/plaintiffs and the respondents/defendants, it would be advantageous to reproduce the relevant paragraphs of the impugned order dated 03.2.2007, passed by Senior Member, Board of Revenue, Sindh:--
""9.
 In view of the statement of the then Commissioner, Sukkur Division, Sukkur, there remains no room of doubt that the so-called order dated 24.02. (year not mentioned) on the original Deh Form against entry No.245 dated 10.02.2001 is totally fabricated, false and fraudulent which is hereby set aside and entry No.245 is restored. Accordingly, the Revision Petition is allowed.
10. However, before parting with the order, it is pertinent to point out that on careful scrutiny of entry Nos.37, 38 and 150 dated 12.01.1992 and 9.02.1998 in respect of disputed land it is observed that the same are entered in VF-VII-B of Deh Gujo Tapo Luqman taluka Khairpur instead of Deh Nizamani taluka Khairpur (where disputed land is situated) wherein on the same date viz 12.1.1992 (Nos: of same entries 37 and 38) were attested by the Assistant Mukhtiarkar Khairpur and entry No.150 of VF-VII-B of Deh Nizamani was attested by the Mukhtiarkar Khairpur on 21.7.1996. In Deh Gujo entry No.36 was made on 03.02.1992 attested by Assistant Mukhtiarkar Khairpur on 15.2.1992, whereas, entry Nos.38 and 38 below entry No.36 were attested by the Assistant Mukhtiarkar Khairpur on 12.1.1992. Thus the entries have been made ante-dated by passing / inserting a new page of VF-VII-B in Deh Gujo Taluka Khairpur as it is visibly evident from different paper of page No.16 containing ante dated entries Nos.37 and 38 in Deh Gujo. Further there is no entry No.39 while serial numbers of entry Nos.40 and 41 have been interpolated. This requires to be probed into meticulously and thoroughly with reference to the examination of past record of the offices of the Mukhtiarkar Khairpur, Assistant Commissioner Khairpur and Deputy Commissioner, Khairpur.
11. In the above circumstances, Mr. Nazar Muhammad Laghari, Special Secretary (L.U.) Board of Revenue Sindh Karachi is hereby assigned special task and appointed as ENQUIRY OFFICER to prove into the matter of fraud and to conduct enquiry and dig out the culprits who have written so-called order on VF-VII-B in the record of rights on 24.2. (year not mentioned) purported to have been passed by Mr. Nisar Ahmed Siddiqui, the then Commissioner, Sukkur Division Sukkur and Assistant Mukhtiarkar (Revenue), Khairpur, who attested the entry in Deh Gujo Taluka Khairpur (instead of Deh Nizamani) and also in Deh Nizamani, after verifying both VF-VII of Deh Nizamani and Gujo. He should fix the responsibility of officers/officials involved in the forgery and tampering with the record and suggest action against them under provisions of Removal from Service (Special Powers) Sindh Ordinance 2000 within two months.""
8.
 A perusal of the record reveals that the copy of entry Annexure ""D"", available at page 43 i.e. the basic entry, on which the applicants/plaintiffs based their claim is shown to be an entry of number shumari, which, from face of it, is a bogus and manipulated entry, that can be seen with naked eye, for, it shows the year for which was it kept as 1936-35, which should have been as 1935-36 instead of 1936-35; it does not bear entry number; her highness Iqbal Begum has been shown as his highness; it purported to be entry of Number Shumari Form No.3 for the year 1936-35 and at the same time it was also shown to be ""Pher Phar"" register (Mutation Register), although the latter being different and permanent record could not be for one year; annexure ""G"", available at Page-51, which is the copy of alleged entry No.37, showing Foti Khata Badal of Ghulam Muhammad, column No.3 thereof, shows corresponding mutation 1935 and number shumari. Moreover, Member, Board of Revenue, verified the original revenue record and found fabricated, false and fraudulent note purportedly order dated 24.02.(year not mentioned) purported to be of Commissioner, Sukkur Division on the original Deh Form against entry No.245, dated 10.2.2011 and that entry Nos.37, 38 and 150, dated 12.1.1992 and 09.2.1998 in respect of the disputed land situated in deh Nizamani were entered in V.F VII-B of Deh Gujo, Tapo Luqman, taluka Khairpur instead of Deh Nizamani, taluka Khairpur, and whereas in Deh Gujo entry No.36 was made on 03.2.1992 shown attested by Assistant Mukhtiarkar, Khairpur on 15.2.1992; the entries Nos.37, 38 and 150 of Deh Nizamani were inserted in VF VII-B of Deh Gujo, which too were of different paper; page No.16 contained entries Nos.37 and 38, but entry No.39 was found missing and serial number of entries Nos.40 and 41 interpolated. In the wake of such state of the record, the Member, Board of Revenue observed that thorough and meticulous probe with reference to the examination of the past record of offices of Mukhtiarkar, Khairpur, Assistant Commissioner, Khairpur and Deputy Commissioner, Khairpur was required to be made and in such view of the matter Mr. Nazar Muhammad Leghari. Special Secretary (LU) Board of Revenue was assigned special task by appointing him as enquiry officer probe into the matter of fraud and to dig out the culprits and fix responsibility on the officers/officials involved in the forgery and tampering with the record.
9.
 Section 4 of the Land Revenue Act, 1967 reads as under:--
""4. Superintendence and control of Revenue Officers and Revenue Courts. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other law for the time being in force; but subject to the provisions of subsection (2), and to any orders of the Government with respect to the appointments and conditions of service or Revenue Officers, the general superintendence and control over all Revenue Officers and Revenue Courts in West Pakistan shall vest in, and all such officers in so far as their functions as Revenue Officers are concerned, shall be subordinate to the Board.
(2) The Board shall be subject to the control of the Government, and all matters, other than those in which the Board exercises appellate and revisional jurisdictions the Government shall have power to issue such directions, to the Board as may be considered necessary or expedient and the Board shall carry out those directions.""
 Section 5 of the Land Revenue Act, 1967 reads as under:--
""5. Powers of the Board
.---(1) The Board shall be controlling authority in all matters connected with the administration of the land, collection of Land Revenue, preparations of land records and other matters relating thereto.
(2) The Board shall be the highest Court of appeal and revision in revenue cases in the Province.
(3) All proceedings relating to any of the matters referred to in subsections (1) and (2) which, immediately before the date of coming into force of this Act, were pending before the final appellate or revisional authority of any Province, State or other territory or area which has been included in the Province of West Pakistan, shall stand transferred to the Board.""
10.
 Bare reading of the above provisions of law, envisages that by virtue of Section 4 of the Act 1967 ibid., the Board of Revenue is vested with general superintendence and control over all Revenue Officers and under Section 5 thereof, the Board of Revenue is a controlling authority in all the matters connected with the administration of land, collection of land revenue, preparation of land records and other matters relating thereto and under subsection (2) of Section 5 thereof, the Board of Revenue is constituted the highest Court of appeal and revision in the revenue cases in the province. Thus, the Board of Revenue being the highest Court of Revenue hierarchy in the province has been conferred vast powers of revisions in respect of all the orders, passed by the subordinate Revenue Officers including Commissioner, and, therefore, the Member, Board of Revenue, when exercising his controlling jurisdiction over his subordinate officers and in the exercise of revisional jurisdiction, can pass any order in the circumstances of the case.
11.
 It needs no reiteration that the function of Revenue Officer is to prepare the correct revenue record in the light of evidence with regard to one's title or interest, and, thus the law puts embargo upon the jurisdiction of Civil Court from taking in hand the functions assigned to the Revenue Officers as also the question of their methodology adopted for the discharge of such functions and the jurisdiction of Civil Court is ousted to the correction of entries made by the Revenue Officer in performance of his duties. In the case one in hand the highest revenue hierarchy, namely, Senior Member, Board of Revenue, Sindh, has passed the impugned order dated 03.2.2007 in an exhaustive manner after verifying the original record etc within the domain of his powers; and, thus Civil Court's jurisdiction is barred to call in question the said order. In case of Sardar Khan v. Ghulam Hussain and others reported as 2003 YLR 1788, it has been held that the correction of revenue record is within the exclusive competence of Revenue Department as has been laid down in Section 172 of Land Revenue Act, 1967 and jurisdiction of Civil Court in cases where the correction of any entry in the record of rights or in the periodical record or register of mutations has been excluded.
12.
 In case of Raja Ajaib Khan v. Soofi Allah Ditta and 4 others (1998 SCMR 471) the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held:--
""that Civil Court was not competent to interfere where the Revenue Courts/Authorities had the exclusive jurisdiction.""
13
 In case of Haji Nek Muhammad v. Province of West Pakistan and 12 others (PLD 1966 (W. P.) Karachi 314) this Court had held that finding of fact given by Board of Revenue within its jurisdiction cannot be questioned in Civil Court.
14.
 It has also been observed by the Lahore High Court in case of Shaukat Ali v. Jalal-ud-Din and others (1999 CLC 1396) that the Revenue Courts have hierarchy of their own and until and unless their orders are not found to be passed without lawful authority and jurisdiction, the Civil Court has no jurisdiction to interfere the same.
15.
 The learned trial Court has rejected the plaint of the subject suit being F.C. Suit No.21 of 2007 filed by the applicants vide order dated 30.05.2009. The relevant paragraphs of the said order dated 30.05.2009, passed by the trial Court, are reproduced here for the sake of convenience:--
""I have also perused the orders dated 10.2.2001 and 3.2.2007 passed by defendants Nos. 3 and 5 which are regarding manipulation of revenue record and they also shows that the defendant No.5 has ordered that according to record he has observed that there is fraud and manipulation in revenue record regarding disputed land and he has appointed Mr. Nazar Mohammad Laghari, Special Secretary Board of Revenue Sindh Karachi as enquiry officer to probe into the matter of fraud and to conduct enquiry and to declare the real culprits who have committed fraud in the record of rights.
From the perusal of all these orders it clearly shows that both these orders have been passed accordingly because in order dated 19.12.2000 it has been stated that necessary entries in record of rights may be kept after verification and so also after codal formalities regarding disputed land, while in another order dated 3.2.2007 enquiry officer has been appointed to declare persons who have fraud and manipulation in revenue record and have managed false entries in record of rights as stated here-in-above. Hence, all these orders have been passed in accordance with the law, who are empowered to do so because they can verify revenue record and keep such entries in record of rights after verifying regarding actual ownership. Even otherwise, the plaintiffs in their plaint specifically at para No.9 have stated that the defendant No.1 in their absence and taking undue advantage has fabricated and manipulated the revenue record in his favour in collusion with revenue staff. Therefore, above these orders also said to have been favouring the plaintiffs regarding fraud and manipulation of revenue record and have been passed within their jurisdiction, hence this court is not competent to interfere in orders passed under administrative and so also under Revenue Act. However, it is also interesting to note that the plaintiffs have themselves stated in their plaint at para No.13, that the disputed land had already been subjudice in F. C. Suit No.286 of 2006 ""His Highness Mir Ali Murad Khan v. P.O. Sindh and others for declaration, mandatory injunction and permanent injunction and such decree has already been passed in their absence and in paras Nos.I4 and 15 they have also stated that another civil suit bearing suit No.293 of 2006 Hafeez Ahmed and others v. His Highness Mir Ali Murad Khan and others were also filed, but was withdrawn, even then no where the plaintiffs have stated that had ever they filed any appeal against decree in Civil Suit No.286 of 2006 and said were set aside, hence the suit of the plaintiffs also falls under section 11 of Res Judicata as the question regarding declaration of ownership has already been subjudice before another court.
Therefore, in view of above discussion and reasons, the suit of the plaintiffs is not maintainable according to law, is barred by Section 42 of Specific Relief Act and so also Section 11 of Res-Judicata. Therefore, the application under Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. filed by defendant No.1 merits consideration and same is hereby allowed. Consequently, the plaint/suit of the plaintiffs is hereby rejected under Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. with no order as to costs.""
16.
 The learned Appellate Court dismissed the appeal filed by the applicants, vide judgment dated 17.09.2009 and decree dated 19.9.2009. The relevant paragraphs of the said judgment dated 17.9.2009 are reproduced here, for the sake of convenience:--
""The minute perusal of the order dated:03.02.2007 passed by the Board of Revenue shows that it has clearly declared the order in the name of Commissioner Sukkur re-produced in paragraph No.8 as fraudulent and forged. According to plaint this order confirms the right of appellants/plaintiffs. After such findings of the highest forum of the Revenue Department there remains no cause of action to further litigate on the order which has been found forged.
This is suit for declaration which is governed under section 42 of Specific Relief Act and text of section 42 is reproduced herein below for sake of convenience:-
 ""Discretion of Court as to declaration of status or right.
Any person entitled to any legal character or to right as to any property, may institute a suit against any person denying, or interested to deny, his title to such character or right and the Court may in its discretion make therein a declaration that he is so entitled, and the plaintiff need not in such suit ask for any further relief.
Bar to such declaration: Provided that no Court shall make any such declaration where the plaintiff, being able to seek further relief than a mere declaration of title, omits to do so"".
It is clear from the bare reading of section 42 of Specific Relief Act that any person entitled to any legal character can seek the declaration.
In this case appellants/plaintiffs have based their title upon entry No.289 of mutation register and entry Nos.37-38 of Deh Form VII-B of Deh Nizamani. After minus the order purported to have been passed by Commissioner Khairpur on 24.02. the entry No.245 comes to its original position and that original entry No.245 does speak against entry No.289 or 37- 38. As such no cause of action appears to have been occurred to the appellants/plaintiffs to knock the door of civil court.
It has been held in the case 1998 CLC 382 that Court was duty bound to bury incompetent plaint in its infancy. It has been held in the case 1999 YLR 2061 that object of Order VII Rule 11, C.P.C. is to save the parties from rigors of frivolous litigation at the very inception of proceedings. In this case it has been discussed in preceding paragraph No.11 that appellants/plaintiffs had no cause of action for filing the declaratory suit and in such situation the learned trial court has rightly rejected the plaint.
In view of above discussions and reasons the civil appeal in hand is dismissed with no order as to costs. The case law relied upon by learned advocate for the appellants/plaintiff are quite distinguishable on facts and circumstances of this case.""
17.
 In case of Muhammad Ramzan and others v. Member (REV.)/CSS and others (1997 SCMR 1635) the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that:--
""entire edifice constructed on the basis of void order crumbles along with same and did not require to be set aside through appeal or any other proceedings.""
18.
 In case of Rehmatullah and others v. Saleh Khan and others (2007 SCMR 729), the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that:--
""when the basic order is without lawful authority then all the superstructure shall fall on the ground automatically.""
19.
 Needless to add that the declaratory relief under Section 42 of the Specific Relief Act (I of 1877) is discretionary in nature as is revealed from plain reading of Section 42 of the Act ibid reproduced hereinabove, and thus, the plaintiff, who seeks discretionary relief under Section 42 of the Act ibid must come in Court with clean hands. In the case in hand the applicants by misrepresenting the facts, claimed his right and title over the subject property on the basis of a fabricated, false and fraudulent entry, which adversely reflects upon the case of the applicants.
20.
 In view of the above, I am of the humble view that the alleged basic entry, which has been held to be fabricated, false and fraudulent by the Member, Board of Revenue Sindh after verification of the original record, being custodian thereof, does not, ipso facto, create cause of action for the applicants to call in question such orders by filing declaratory suit, more particularly when the applicants are admittedly out of possession of the subject property. It is the requirement of law that the incompetent suit should be buried at its inception, which would be in the interest of litigating parties and the judicial institution itself, as the parties are saved with their time and unnecessary expenses and the Courts will also get more time to devote it for the genuine causes. It is also worthwhile to mention here that the stance of the applicants before both the forums below was that the Court, while considering an application under Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. had to examine only the plaint and the averments of the plaint to be taken as true. In this context, it may be observed that the parties coming before the Court were required to place before it all facts necessary material and where the Court was made aware, whether through an application, written statement or otherwise that the plaintiff had suppressed material facts, which if pleaded in the plaint, he would have been out of the Court, for having no cause of action, facts so brought to the notice of the Court would be deemed to be part of the plaint being already in existence and the plaintiff being bound to have pleaded those facts in the plaint, having not pleaded so, the plaintiff's such mischief in not placing those true facts before the Court for sinister purpose, could not exonerate him from the operation of law and plaint not disclosing such material facts could be rejected, by taking into consideration the facts judicially noticeable. Both the Courts below, in addition to the plaint, looking into the admitted/undisputed documents and facts, such as, record before the revenue authorities relating to the previous litigation between the parties, rightly rejected the plaint, for, an incompetent suit should be buried without further proceedings; Courts should look attentively to the plaints to find whether they attract application of Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C., if facts of the case justify, application of Order VII, Rule 1, C.P.C. must be applied for rejection of the plaint, irrespective of the fact whether it is stage of disposal of an interlocutory application or even it is somewhat earlier stage.
21.
 In view of what has been discussed above, I am of the considered view that the trial Court by rejecting the plaint of subject suit and the 1st appellate Court by dismissing the appeal filed against the orders passed by the trial Court, rejecting the plaint, have not committed any illegality and there is also no infirmity or jurisdictional defect, in the exercise of jurisdiction by both the Courts below while passing the impugned order, judgment and decrees, attracting the provisions of section 115 of the Civil Procedure Code (V of 1908). Accordingly, the instant civil revision application being devoid of merit is dismissed with no order as to costs.
22.
 All the pending applications having become infruetuous stand dismissed.

 The facts precisely stated are that complainant, Raja Shahzad Khan son of Raja Shahnawaz Khan, lodged a written report at Police Station, Dudyal, on 21.11.2005, at 13:30, stating therein that he along with Sarfaraz, Pervaiz and Afraz, was sitting in courtyard of P.C.O of Raja Ghazanfar, situated near Hospital at Siyakh, meanwhile, (i) Jahangir Akbar, (ii) Naseer Akbar, (iii) Muhammad Asif, (iv) Muhammad Tariq, (v) Ali Jan Shah, (vi) Muhammad Arshad and (vii) Muhammad Kabeer, riding in a blue coloured Jeep/Land Cruiser, owned by Jahangir Akbar, arrived there. Jahangir Akbar, Naseer Akbar, Asif and Tariq were armed with Kalashnikov shape rifles, whereas others were armed with 12-bore guns. Accused, Jahangir Akbar, alighting from Jeep, at once raised 'lalkara' and fired a burst, out of which a bullet hit Sarfaraz, on his ribs and thereafter other accused-persons started straight firing, which hit on hip and legs of Sarfaraz. However, he (complainant) and his other companions had luckily a narrow escape, whereas, Sarfaraz, died at spot. The occurrence, besides complainant and his companions, was also witnessed by other people. The motive beyond the occurrence was that Jahangir etc used to demand hooligan-tax (Goonda-Tax) and in the morning of occurrence, Jahangir, accused, intercepting Sarfaraz and Pervaiz at Bathar curve, demanded money, but upon their refusal, an altercation took place between Jahangir and Sarfaraz, however, Jahangir, extended dire consequences and went away. The dead body of Sarfaraz, was brought in Hospital and application, was moved to initiate legal proceedings.

 As per the aforesaid report, a case bearing FIR No.174/2005, in offences under sections 302, 324, 147, 148 and 149, A.P.C. was registered against accused-persons at Police Station, Dudyal, on 21.11.2005 and postmortem of Sarfaraz, deceased, was conducted by Dr. Liaquat Ali, SMO, T.H.Q. Hospital, Dudyal, who found the following injuries on the person of deceased:--

4.
 The police started investigation and accused-persons, namely, Naseer Akbar, Muhammad Arshad, Muhammad Kabeer, Ali Jan Shah and Asif, were arrested, whereas accused-persons, Jahangir Akbar and Muhammad Tariq, remained absconder, who, however, were arrested on 16.2.2007 and 19.5.2007, respectively. During investigation, weapons of offence, a Kalashnikov from Naseer Akbar, a 12-bore gun from Muhammad Arshad, a 12-bore gun from Muhammad Kabeer, a Kalashnikov, bearing No.54262 along with magazine, from Jahangir Akbar, a 222-bore rifle, bearing No.AO15 along with magazine, from Muhammad Tariq, accused-persons, were recovered. After completion of investigation, accused-persons, namely, Naseer Akbar, Jahangir Akbar, Muhammad Tariq, Muhammad Kabeer and Muhammad Arshad, were challaned in offences under sections 302, 324, 147, 148, 149, A.P.C. and 13/20/65, Arms Act, before concerned Court, whereas Ali Jan Shah and Muhammad Asif, accused-persons, were exonerated by police under section 169, Cr.P.C. The Additional District Court of Criminal Jurisdiction, Mirpur, after submission of challan, recorded statements of accused-persons, except Muhammad Tariq, under section 265-D, Cr.P.C, and Muhammad Tariq's statement was recorded under section 242, Cr.P.C, who pleaded not guilty. Thereupon, prosecution was ordered to produce evidence in support of its case, which was produced. The evidence adduced by prosecution against accused-persons, was put to them as required by section 342, Cr.P.C., who once again denied the guilt and opted to get record their statements under section 340, Cr.P.C. Thereupon, the trial Court recorded statements of Jahangir Akbar and Naseer Akbar, accused-persons, under section 340(2), Cr.P.C. on 14.06.2016.
5.
 The learned Additional District Court of Criminal Jurisdiction, Mirpur, after conclusion of trial and hearing arguments, awarded life imprisonment as 'Tazir' under section 302(b), A.P.C. to Jahangir Akbar, Naseer Akbar, Muhammad Tariq and Muhammad Kabeer, appellants-convicts, whereas they were acquitted under section 13/20/65, Arms Act. They were also imposed compensation under section 544-A, Cr.P.C. as Rs.3,00,000/- each, which would be paid to legal heirs of Sarfaraz, deceased, and in case of default of payment, they shall have to undergo further 06 months' simple imprisonment. Muhammad Arshad, accused, was awarded five years' simple imprisonment with fine of Rs.20,000/-, under section 201, A.P.C. and in default of payment of fine, he shall have to undergo further 06 months' simple imprisonment. However, all the appellants-convicts, were extended benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C., vide the impugned judgment dated 28.07.2016. The appellants-convicts feeling aggrieved from their convictions and sentences, have filed Appeal No.39/2016 dated 05.08.2016, whereas, complainant, Raja Shahzad Khan, preferred Appeal No.41/2016 dated 20.08.2016, against appellants-convicts for enhancing their sentences upto extreme penalty.
6.
 Mr. Khalid Rasheed Chaudhary, the learned Counsel for appellants-convicts, submitted that FIR was concocted, fabricated and during investigation even its contents were negated by complainant in his Court statement. He pointed out that as per prosecution story, accused-party recklessly fired upon deceased, but surprisingly he did not receive any injury on upper vital part of his body, which negates prosecution story. He further contended that the given case was of no evidence and even prosecution failed to prove time, place and manner of occurrence, as alleged in FIR and in statements recorded under section 161, Cr.P.C. The learned Counsel argued that medical evidence was not in line with prosecution version rather it was in negation of prosecution story. He contended that most of the planted eye-witnesses were interested and chance witnesses and their statements were not in line with initial statements recorded under section 161, Cr.P.C. and FIR which were not corroborated by independent witnesses. He agitated that prosecution failed to prove motive, that an altercation took place between Jahangir Akbar, accused, and Sarfaraz, deceased, and accused-persons used to receive 'Goonda-tax', because in this regard sole witness was Pervaiz (P.W.3), who was given up by prosecution while declaring that he was unnecessary witness, whereas other P.Ws. narrated hearsay story, which was a mitigating circumstance for acquittal of accused-persons, however, the Court below failed to ponder upon this aspect of the matter. The learned Counsel submitted that statements of so-called eye-witnesses, who are interested and inter-se related, were falsified to the extent of two accused-persons, hence, could not be relied upon to the extent of other co-accused-persons, but the Court below wrongly awarded them sentences, which are liable to be set-aside as such. The learned Counsel contended that it was celebrated precept of law that in case of different versions of eye-witnesses, the version favouring to accused should be relied upon, but the Court below failed to ponder upon this aspect of the case in judicious manner. He further contended that weak and unreliable oral evidence was not corroborated by recoveries and all accused-persons were entitled to be acquitted of charge, while the other evidence in shape of statements of Investigation Officers, Patwari and Doctor were not in line with each other. He emphasized that all recoveries could not be proved; therefore, accused-persons were liable to be acquitted on this score too. The learned Counsel pointed out that site plan being important piece of evidence was also not in line with prosecution version rather fully negated the prosecution story. The learned Counsel pressed into service that I.O. himself did not support prosecution version rather favouring complainant-party, it was planned trap of accused-persons in the case by I.O. and he behaved like complainant. He further contended that I.Os. leveled serious allegations against accused-persons, like hardened, desperate and dangerous criminals, which means that they were inimical towards accused-persons. The learned Counsel agitated that important fact was suppressed by prosecution that accused-persons in all other cases were acquitted of charge, which creates serious doubt, in prosecution story. He pointed out that in the instant case 07 accused-persons, namely, Jahangir Akbar, Naseer Akbar, Muhammad Asif, Tariq, Ali Jan Shah, Muhammad Arshad and Muhammad Kabeer, were implicated; however, during investigation, amongst them, two accused-persons, Asif and Jan Shah, were exonerated by police on the ground that they were not participants of the instant occurrence, but their exoneration was not challenged by prosecution at any forum, whereas all of the aforesaid accused-persons, were attributed to same role of firing at deceased. The learned Counsel further contended that as per statements of Allah Dad P.W., dated 22.11.2005 and 08.01.2006, Muhammad Asif, Ali Jan Shah and Muhammad Tariq, accused-persons, were not present at spot, however, Muhammad Tariq, accused, was also awarded 25 years life imprisonment. The learned Counsel submitted that statement of Jahangir Akbar, accused, under section 164, Cr.P.C. was not recorded by Magistrate; therefore, the same was not reliable, but the Court below failed to consider this aspect too, rather prosecution witnesses tried to conceal their relationship with deceased. He argued that P.Ws. Allah Dad and Shakeel, were not nominated in FIR and no independent witness from neighboring was associated in the case. He further contended that P.Ws. made improvements in their Court statements, for instance they did not depose in earlier statements that they concealed themselves under the cot. He pointed out that neither a cot was recovered nor there was any mentioning about it in site-plan. The learned Counsel agitated that statements of Allah Dad and Shakeel P.Ws., recorded under section 161, Cr.P.C. at belated stage, could not be taken into consideration. He submitted that except Allah Dad P.W., the other P.Ws. did not depose that Arshad, accused, was driving alleged Land Cruiser. He emphasized that Shakeel P.W., deposed contrary to site-plan, that Jahangir Akbar and Muhammad Kabeer, accused, were firing in front of Hotel. He pointed out that places of witnesses, as per site-plan, were wrongly inserted in it. The learned counsel further agitated that empties of 8MM were recovered but no recovery of 8MM was made and accused were alleged to make firing with Kalashnikovs and 12-bore guns, so it was not clear that from what kind of weapon deceased received injuries; therefore, prosecution miserably failed to prove manner of occurrence. The learned Counsel, in rebuttal, submitted that a J.I.T. was constituted in the instant case, however, its report was not exhibited in evidence; therefore, the same could not be read against accused-persons. The learned Counsel also pointed out that accused-persons were sentenced by trial Court on the ground of some suggestions and not on the basis of evidence. He argued that in light of evidence and circumstances of the case, accused-persons, were liable to be acquitted of charges, but the Court below committed grave error while awarding them sentences; therefore, by accepting their appeal they may be acquitted of the charges and appeal filed by complainant may be dismissed. He, in support of his arguments, cited the following case law:-

 Conversely, Raja Khalid Mahmood, the learned Counsel for complainant submitted that prosecution cited 36 witnesses in calendar of challan, out of whom P.W.3, was given up because he was abroad, however, eye-witnesses, Shahzad, Afraz, Shakeel and Allah Dad, deposed that accused-persons had been receiving hooligan-tax. Likewise Investigating Officer, Nasrullah, also stated about 'Goonda-Tax', and even otherwise, in presence of eye-witnesses, there was no need to prove motive. The learned Counsel pointed out that statements of some of P.Ws. under section 161, Cr.P.C, were recorded next day of occurrence, however, such delay was sufficiently explained by Nadeem Arif, I.O., that on the day of occurrence, a dead body was found from place of Ratta; hence, he went there and could not record statements of P.Ws. in the instant case. The learned Counsel submitted that presence of accused-persons at spot, the roles attributed to them and recoveries of the weapons of offence have fully proved through cogent, convincing and reliable evidence, however, the Court below committed illegality while awarding lesser punishment to accused-persons, instead of death sentence. The learned Counsel pointed out that accused got recorded their statements in defense, on account of which burden of proof shifted from prosecution to defense, however, the defense could not prove innocence of accused-persons. The learned Counsel also contended that contents of site-plan were wrongly interpreted by the learned Counsel for accused-persons. He agitated that if some minor contradictions appear in prosecution evidence, which was natural aspect of the case, and such contradictions would not give any benefit to accused-party. The learned Counsel contended that recovered empties and holes found on clothing of deceased were the same in numbers, which fact fully proved case against accused-persons. The learned Counsel submitted that there was no contradiction in evidence of recoveries witnesses, so under Article 54 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, the same was proved against accused-persons. The learned Counsel contended that a J.I.T. was formed and as per its report, though not exhibited, accused-persons were found habitual and professional offenders, against whom about 30 cases were found to be registered in different offences; however, they were so hardened that nobody dared to give evidence against them, hence, in some cases they were acquitted of the charges. The learned Counsel submitted that statement of Jahangir Akbar, accused, was recorded under section 164, Cr.P.C., which fully connected him with the commission of alleged offence. The learned Counsel further submitted that presence of accused, site-plan, recoveries, medical report and other evidence fully established case against accused-persons; therefore, while accepting complainant's appeal, they may be awarded death sentence, as they were vicariously liable for death of Sarfaraz, deceased. He finally submitted for dismissal of appeal filed by appellants-convicts and placed reliance upon the following authorities:-

 Hafiz Fazl-ur-Rahman Dar, the learned Assistant Advocate General, appearing on behalf of State, fully owned and supported arguments addressed by the learned Counsel for complainant and prayed for acceptance of appeal filed by complainant.
9.
 We have given our dispassionate thought to arguments at Bar by the learned Advocates for parties and gone through the record of the case with utmost care.
10.
 The prosecution case, as per written report of complainant, Raja Shahzad Khan, is that, on 21.11.2005, he along with Sarfaraz, Pervaiz and Afraz, was sitting in courtyard of P.C.O of Raja Ghazanfar, situated near Hospital at Siyakh, meanwhile, Jahangir Akbar, Naseer Akbar, Muhammad Asif, Muhammad Tariq, Ali Jan Shah, Muhammad Arshad and Muhammad Kabeer, riding in a blue coloured Jeep/Land Cruiser, owned by Jahangir Akbar, arrived there. Jahangir Akbar, Naseer Akbar, Muhammad Asif and Muhammad Tariq, were armed with Kalashnikovs, whereas others were armed with 12-bore guns. Accused, Jahangir Akbar, alighting from Jeep, at once raised 'lalkara' and fired a burst, out of which a bullet hit Sarfaraz, on his ribs and thereafter other accused-persons started straight firing, which hit on hip and legs of Sarfaraz. However, complainant and his other companions luckily narrow escaped, whereas Sarfaraz, died at spot. The occurrence, besides complainant and his companions, was also witnessed by other people. The motive beyond the occurrence was stated that Jahangir etc, used to demand hooligan-tax (Goonda-Tax) and in the morning of occurrence, Jahangir, accused, intercepting Sarfaraz and Pervaiz, at Bathar curve, demanded money, however, on their refusal, an altercation took place between Jahangir and Sarfaraz, then Jahangir, extending dire consequences, went away, and later on committed the said offence.
11.
 It is worthwhile to observe here that as per Contents of FIR, there are three eye-witnesses, namely, Raja Shahzad Khan, Pervaiz and Afraz; however, Allah Dad and Muhammad Shakeel, were also cited as eye-witnesses in calendar of challan. As per argument of the learned Counsel for appellants-convicts, Raja Shahzad Khan and Afraz, are close relatives of deceased and their evidence was not corroborated by independent witnesses, whereas Allah Dad and Muhammad Shakeel, P.Ws. are chance witnesses; hence, evidence of the aforesaid P.Ws. cannot be relied upon. A minute perusal of record although shows that Raja Shahzad Khan and Afraz, eye-witnesses, are relatives of deceased, however, it is well-settled principle of law that evidence of a close relative cannot be brushed aside on the ground of relationship, especially so when he has not been shown inimical to the accused. The aforesaid view is supported from a case titled Muhammad Khalil v. The State (1992 SCR 249), wherein, it was held as under:--
""We have given due consideration to the arguments raised at the bar. The first question relates to the credibility of the eye-witnesses namely, Gulzar Ahmad, Muhammad Malik, Nazar Muhammad and Abdul Hamid. These witnesses have been relied upon not only by the members of the District Criminal Court but also by the Shariat Court. As has already been pointed out, the difference of opinion between the members of the Shariat Court was with regard to the nature and quantum of punishment to be awarded to the accused persons, namely Muhammad Khalil and Muhammad Tariq and not about their guilt. The mere fact that some of these witnesses are related to the deceased are not sufficient to discard their testimony, especially so when they have not been shown inimical to the accused-appellant.""
The same view was reiterated by the Apex Court in case titled Muhammad Tahir Aziz v. The State and another (2009 SCR 71) wherein, it was laid down as under:-
""It is well settled principle of law that mere relationship is no ground for discarding the evidence of a prosecution witness, unless and until his enmity is established with the accused person.""
12.
 The second part of argument of the learned Counsel for appellants-convicts is that evidence of interested and related witnesses was not corroborated by independent witnesses. We may examine here that as to what corroboration exactly means. Broadly speaking the corroboration means a sort of confirmation of conclusions about existence of certain fact and corroboration of the statement of an interested witness does not mean that the statement of the witness is false or untrue, rather it is desirable to accept it as wholly true that it should have a confirmatory support by way of precaution to attain clarity. The view is supported from a case reported as Muhammad Sharif v. The State [PLD 1978 SC (AJK) 146), wherein, it was laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court as under:-
""Before discussing the available confirmatory evidence, it would be expedient to determine as to what corroboration means ""Corrobora-tion"" of the statement of interested witnesses does not mean that the statement of the witnesses is false or untrue. What it really means is that to accept it as wholly true it is desirable that it should have a confirmatory support. In fact when it is said that the statement of witnesses need corroboration to support it, this finding proceeds on the basis that version of P.Ws. is prima facie correct but by way of precaution it needs corroboration to attain clarity.""
We are alive that in the case of an interested witness, the corroboration need not be of the same probative force as in the case of an accomplice. For corroboration, it is not necessary that there should be an independent witness supporting the story put forward by an interested witness, rather corroboration may be afforded by anything in the circumstances of a case which tends sufficiently to satisfy the mind of the Court that the witness has spoken the truth. The aforesaid view is fortified from a case titled as Nazir and others v. The State (PLD 1962 SC 269), wherein, it was held as under:--
""This is what is meant by saying that the statement of an interested witness ordinarily needs corroboration. For corroboration it is not necessary that there should be the word of an independent witness supporting the story put forward by an interested witness. Corroboration may be afforded by anything in the circumstances of a case which tends sufficiently to satisfy the mind of the Court that the witness has spoken the truth. What circumstances will be sufficient as corroboration it is not possible to lay down. But, as the question before the Court would be whether some innocent person had not been implicated in addition to those who were guilty the circumstance relied upon must have a bearing on this question. In the case of an interested witness the corroboration need not be of the same probative force as in the case of an accomplice for the two do not stand on the same footing.""
13.
 The third part of argument of the learned Counsel for appellants-convicts is that Allah Dad and Muhammad Shakeel, are chance witnesses. A perusal of record reveals that Allah Dad, P.W., was running a Hotel near the place of occurrence and at the time of occurrence he was present at Hotel, whereas, as per statement of Muhammad Shakeel P.W., he was also present at the Hotel when occurrence took place and it is well settled that if a chance witness reasonably explains his presence at the concerned place and states about occurrence in such a way that inspires confidence and is also corroborated by any other evidence or circumstance, the same can be considered and relied upon. The view finds support from a case reported as Iqbal v. State 1998 MLD 1372, wherein, it was held as under:-
""The presence of this witness at the spot and his witnessing the occurrence on the fateful night, therefore, was sheer chance and it can conveniently be said that he was a chance witness but his statement cannot be brushed aside simply on this point alone. If a chance witness reasonably explains his presence at the spot and renders narration of the occurrence in such a way that the same inspires confidence and it was further supported by the evidence, which materially corroborates such version then the same can be considered along with other incriminating evidence.""
14.
 However, if for the sake of argument, evidence of aforesaid two witnesses, Allah Dad and Muhammad Shakeel, is not considered, even then there are two eye-witnesses in the instant case and if Court reaches the conclusion that their evidence is trustworthy and confidence inspiring, then the same would be sufficient for awarding sentence. Therefore, argument of the learned Counsel for appellants-convicts, discussed supra, being devoid of force, is repelled.
15.
 The next argument of the learned Counsel for appellants-convicts is that, as per prosecution story, an altercation took place between Jahangir Akbar, accused, and Sarfaraz, deceased, and accused-persons used to receive 'Goondatax', and in this regard Pervaiz (P.W.3) was the sole witness, who was given up by prosecution while declaring him unnecessary witness and other P.Ws. in this context, narrated hearsay story; therefore, prosecution failed to prove alleged motive for the commission of murder. A reading of record reveals that Pervaiz P.W., was abroad; therefore, his statement could not be recorded. Apart from the aforesaid fact, it is well settled principle of law that prosecution was not duty bound to produce each and every witness cited in the calendar, rather it depends upon the will of prosecution to produce such witnesses whom it deems necessary for proving the guilt of accused. The aforesaid view stands fortified from a case reported as Abdul Aziz v . Muhammad Lal and 2 others 1999 YLR 1755 wherein, it was laid down as under:--
""After hearing the respective contentions of the learned Counsel for the parties and perusing the record, it may be stated at the very outset that it is not the duty of the prosecution to produce each and every witness cited in the calendar of challan. It depends on the will of the prosecution to produce such witnesses whom it deems necessary for proving the guilt of the accused. However, if the evidence of any of the witnesses is so material that in absence of it no just decision could be pronounced by the Court, the Court is competent to summon such witness and record his statement.""
16.
 It would not be out of place to observe here that motive plays an important role in the cases of circumstantial evidence, whereas, the instant case is primarily based on ocular evidence, which can be relied upon in light of detailed discussion made in paragraphs 11 and 12 supra. It is evident from facts of the case that occurrence took place at day time, which was witnessed by eye-witnesses, and it is well settled dogma of law that if a case is primarily based on ocular evidence, it is not necessary to prove motive. The aforesaid view is fortified from a case reported as Raj Muhammad v. State and 4 others 2014 YLR 2612 wherein, it was observed as under:--
""We have also considered the argument of the learned Counsel that the motive for commission of offence was alleged by the prosecution which has not been proved. The complainant alleged in the FIR that in the last evening, an altercation had taken place between his nephew and grand-children of the accused. He has taken the same version in the Court's statement and the version is proved from the statement of the complainant. In the case titled Abdul Rashid and 3 others v. Abdul Ghaffar and 5 others [2001 SCR 240], has observed that it is settled principle of law that if a case is primarily based on ocular evidence, it is not necessary to prove the motive.""
The same view was reiterated by the Apex Court in case titled Abdul Majeed and 4 others v. Muhammad Latif and 3 others (2016 SCR 1306). Therefore, argument of the learned Counsel for appellants-convicts, being without any force, is turned down.
17.
 The next contention of the learned Counsel for appellants-convicts is that statements of so-called eye-witnesses, who are interested and inter-se related, were falsified to the extent of two accused-persons, hence, cannot be relied upon to the extent of other co-accused-persons, however, the Court below wrongly awarded them sentences. It would be worthwhile to observe here that it is not necessary that if a piece of evidence disbelieved to the extent of one accused, the same cannot be believed to the extent of other accused against whom cogent, convincing and confidence inspiring evidence is available on record, because it is well settled principle of administration of criminal justice that the Courts have to sift grains from chaff. The aforesaid view is supported from a case reported as Muhammad Bashir and another v. Sain Khan and 2 others (2014 SCR 821), wherein, it was held as under:--
""Same like, the argument of the learned Counsel for the convict-appellant that the material on the basis of which the conviction order against Sain Khan, convict-appellant has been passed, is not believable because on the basis of same evidence, the other accused-persons have been acquitted. As for the appeal filed by the convict-appellant for his acquittal is concerned, has no substance in the light of the peculiar facts of the case. According to the century's old settled principles of administration of criminal justice, the Courts have to sift the grains from the chaff. It is not necessary that if a piece of evidence is disbelieved to the extent of one according to his assigned conduct in the prosecution story, the same cannot be believed to the extent of other accused against whom cogent, confidence inspiring evidence is available on record. In this case, the convict-appellant has been assigned a specific role which has been successfully proved by the prosecution. Whereas the role of other accused-persons is quite different, therefore, the version of defence counsel being incorrect is not acceptable.""
The argument of the learned Counsel for appellants-convicts, therefore, stands rejected.
18.
 The learned Counsel for appellants-convicts further raised a point in his arguments that same role of firing was attributed to seven (07) accused-persons, out of whom, Ali Jan Shah and Muhammad Asif, were exonerated by police under section 169, Cr.P.C. so case of prosecution becomes doubtful. It would be pertinent to observe here that it is duty of investigating agency to trace out real culprits and exonerate innocent persons by conducting fair and impartial investigation. It is worthwhile to observe here that it has developed a common tendency in our society to implicate entire family of an accused in the case and to throw net more widely in order to take revenge of victim, with a real culprit, which trend ought to be condemned by police as well as by Courts. So investigating agency, after conducting thorough investigation of the case, extended benefit of section 169, Cr.P.C. to the aforesaid two accused-persons, which does not mean that their exoneration would give any benefit to remaining accused-persons. Moreover, their exoneration is also an answer to argument of the learned Counsel for appellants-convicts that investigation was conducted with partiality, because if I.Os. had any jaundiced-eye, then they might have challaned the aforesaid accused-persons too along with the other accused. Thus, argument of the learned Counsel is misconceived.
19.
 The contention of the learned Counsel for appellants-convicts is taken into consideration that empties of 8MM were recovered but neither any recovery of 8mm was made nor accused were saddled to fire with 8MM, rather they were alleged to fire with Kalashnikovs and 12-bore guns, so it was not clear that from what kind of weapon deceased received injuries; hence, prosecution miserably failed to prove manner of occurrence. It would be significant to observe here that when an injury is proved to be caused by a fire-arm weapon, it becomes immaterial that what nature of weapon was used. The aforesaid view is fortified from a case reported as Ishtiaq Ahmad v. The State and 2 others [2012 YLR (SC AJ&K) 2587], wherein, was held as under:-
""All the witnesses have categorically stated that the accused was holding single barrel gun. Even otherwise, there is consistent view of the apex Court that if the injury is proved to have been caused by a fire-arm weapon, it would be immaterial that what nature of weapon was used. In this case, the injury caused to Bashir Ahmad is a fire-arm injury, there-fore, it would not be relevant that which type of fire-arm weapon was used. In this regard reliance is placed on Muhammad Ashraf and others v. The State 1994 MLD 692 in which it has been held as under:-
""19. The guns of Zulfiqar and Bashir Ahmad had tallied with the crime empties recovered from the spot although the rifle alleged to have been recovered at the instance of Muhammad Ashraf appellant did not match with the empties of rifle recovered from the spot but this fact alone will not be sufficient to belie his presence at the spot because he led to the recovery of rifle on 19.10.1986. He might have produced some other rifle before the police after concealing or disposing of the one used in the occurrence. ""
Similarly, in case reported as Ellahi Bakhash v. Rab Nawaz and another (2002 SCMR 1842), it was observed by the Apex Court of Pakistan as under:--
"" .It thus hardly matters as to whether 12-bore gun was used or a 7-MM rifle which culminated into the death of deceased. There is no denying the fact that death occurred due to fire-arm injury.""
20.
 Whereas in the instant case, doctor has clearly incorporated in postmortem report that ""Homicidal death occurred due to firearm injury"", thus, argument of the learned Counsel for appellants-convicts is not tenable.
21.
 So far as the alleged contradiction between contents of site-plan and the statements of eye-witnesses regarding the points from where they had seen the occurrence is concerned, these are of minor nature and immaterial. Besides, evidence of a witness cannot be measured according to a mathematical formula. Even a literate witness can make a mistake while giving correct direction of the point in relation to an assailant and victim of crime. The probative force of testimony of an eye-witness in a criminal case depends upon overall effect it creates in the mind of the Court; therefore, minor discrepancies which may crop up in statement of a witness due to lack of knowledge or power of its perception do not demolish the prosecution case. Therefore, argument is turned down.
22.
 The next contention of the learned Counsel for appellants-convicts needs serious consideration, that Allah Dad, P.W., did not mention the name of Muhammad Tariq, accused, in his statements recorded under section 161, Cr.P.C., on 22.11.2005 and 08.01.2006, which makes prosecution case doubtful, however, the Court below also awarded him 25 years life imprisonment. A minute perusal of the aforesaid statements of P.W. reveals that in first statement he nominated four accused-persons, namely Jahangir Akbar, Naseer Akbar, Muhammad Kabeer and Muhammad Arshad, whereas in subsequent statement he added one more unknown person. The important aspect of his subsequent statement dated 08.01.2006, is that on query of Inspector/SHO Dudyal, he deposed that he did not see Ali Jan Shah, Muhammad Asif and Muhammad Tariq, in the Jeep. It is significant to note here that Ali Jan Shah and Muhammad Asif, accused-persons, after investigation, were exonerated by Police; however, their exoneration was not challenged at any forum by complainant-side. The P.W., Allah Dad; however, in his Court statement recorded on 07.07.2008, implicated Muhammad Tariq and during cross-examination deposed that his earlier statements were not recorded by Police as per his disclosure. It is important to observe here that two statements of said P.W. were recorded by Police under section 161, Cr.P.C., and if a disclosure, as per his assertion, was not recorded by Police in first statement, he might have deposed the same in subsequent statement, but in subsequent statement, he, on query of S.H.O., clarified that Ali Jan Shah, Muhammad Asif and Muhammad Tariq, were not seen at spot. Therefore, in view of above, we may hold that the witness, contrary to his earlier statements, made improvements in his Court statement with regard to involvement of Muhammad Tariq, accused. Although, the other P.Ws., Raja Shahzad, Muhammad Afraz and Muhammad Shakeel, nominated Muhammad Tariq, accused, in their statements; however, the aforesaid contradiction in the statement of Allah Dad, P.W., cannot be overlooked, which creates doubt in prosecution story to the extent of involvement of Muhammad Tariq, accused, and it is well settled principle of law that benefit of a single doubt appearing in prosecution story, always goes in favour of accused; hence, in our humble view, the same is extended in favour of Muhammad Tariq, accused.
23.
 The contention of the learned counsel for complainant that a J.I.T. was constituted and as per its report, accused-persons were found habitual and professional offenders, against whom about 30 cases were found to be registered in different offences; however, they were so hardened and influential that nobody dared to give evidence against them and in some cases they were acquitted of the charges, though has weight; however, cannot be considered because the said report of J.I.T was not exhibited, which loses its evidentiary value; therefore, it would not be proper to give any definite opinion on the aforesaid report of J.I.T.
24.
 Another argument raised by the learned Counsel for complainant that statement of Jahangir Akbar, accused, was recorded under section 164, Cr.P.C., which fully connected him with the commission of alleged offence, does not find force because perusal of record reveals that the same was not recorded by Magistrate himself, rather he only signed it, thus, the same cannot be relied upon.
25.
 The trial Court discussed, in details, evidence of eye-witnesses, Raja Shahzad Khan, Afraz, Allah Dad and Muhammad Shakeel, in the impugned judgment, however, in older to arrive at a just and proper conclusion of the matter, we have also scrutinized the same. A minute study of evidence of the aforesaid eye-witnesses reveals that they have narrated the manner of occurrence, as stated by prosecution. They have clearly deposed that accused-persons, who were armed with lethal weapons, riding in a blue coloured Jeep/Land Cruiser, owned by Jahangir Akbar, came at the place of occurrence in their presence, and accused, Jahangir Akbar, alighting from Jeep, at once raised 'lalkara' and fired burst, due to which, a bullet hit Sarfaraz, on his lumber region and thereafter other accused-persons started firing, which hit on hip and legs of Sarfaraz, deceased. In this manner, they are unanimous on the point that Jahangir Akbar, convict-appellant, raising 'lalkara', fired first straight shot with Kalashnikov at Sarfaraz and thereafter other, accused-persons, fired shots with respective lethal weapons. So presence of eye-witnesses at the spot was natural and there was no material contradiction in their statements, rather during cross-examination, the defense could not succeed to bring on record any glaring contradictions, discrepancies or doubt in their evidence. Therefore, conviction under law can be recorded on such evidence without any corroboration. However, ocular evidence gets further support from the other corroboratory evidence. The fact of recoveries of lethal weapons from accused on their pointation, crime empties from the place of occurrence and vehicle used in the occurrence, are also corroborated by the evidence of recovery witnesses. The recoveries of bloodstained clay and clothes of deceased are in the nature of corroborative evidence. Similarly, the reports of Forensic Science Laboratory Punjab, Lahore, and Chemical Examiner are corroboratory pieces of evidence. The postmortem report also corroborates the prosecution story. Thus, we are of the opinion that the testimony of eye-witnesses in the instant case is corroborated in material particulars.
26.
 Now the question emerges whether the punishment of life imprisonment was justified in the instant case or what punishment will be sufficient to meet the ends of justice? The sentence must be weighed in golden scale and should be properly balanced to deter the rest of society from the commission of crimes without being unnecessary harsh. To award punishment is primary function of all the social States. The crucial problem is whether a criminal is considered by the society as a nuisance to be abated or an enemy to be crushed or a patient to be treated or a refectory child to be disciplined or should be regarded as nothing of these things, but simply be punished to show others that antisocial conduct attracts heavy punishment. The problem of crime, criminals and awarding punishment requires attention of Criminologists and Penologists all around the social word, but unfortunately there is dearth of such individuals or institutions, who may give opinions in Criminology and Penology based on our social conditions and provide guidance in respect of punishment. The Court, therefore, cannot resolve the issue of awarding sentence blindly or without taking note of theories of punishment and background of offenders. This duty falls on the superior Courts to fill in vacuum and the Courts should do justice keeping in view all the circumstances and background of the offenders. Therefore, punishment awarded should neither exceed a ceiling equal to a level just deserved by the offender for the offence nor for below a floor level necessary to protect public from further serious crimes and to show that the gravity of offence is depreciated. Where the case of prosecution is proved beyond any doubt, then it is the legal duty of the Courts to award punishment to an offender to make the evil-doer an example and warning for the like-minded persons. Despite the fact that crime is increasing in society, yet the Courts normally avoid awarding capital punishment in the offences punishable with death, which amounts to gross miscarriage of justice, whereas Courts are bound to do complete justice with both parties. Where people fail to secure justice from the Courts of law, then they resort to take law in their own hands to settle their matters themselves and such a situation is very alarming. The Courts, while awarding sentence, should keep in consideration all the circumstances and evidence of the case. In the instant case, the learned Additional District Court of Criminal Jurisdiction, Mirpur, awarded life imprisonment as 'Tazir' under section 302(b),A.P.C, to Jahangir Akbar, Naseer Akbar, Muhammad Tariq and Muhammad Kabeer, appellants-convicts, whereas they were also imposed compensation under section 544-A, Cr.P.C. as Rs.3,00,000/- each, which would be paid to legal heirs of Sarfaraz, deceased, and in case of default of payment, they shall have to undergo further 06 months' simple imprisonment. Muhammad Arshad, accused, was awarded five years' simple imprisonment with fine of Rs.20,000/-, under section 201, A.P.C. and in default of payment of fine, he shall have to undergo further 06 months' simple imprisonment. However, after scrutinizing record and keeping in view overall facts and circumstances of the case, in light of ocular and corroboratory evidence on record, we have arrived at the conclusion that Jahangir Akbar, accused, fired first straight shot with lethal weapon upon Sarfaraz, deceased, which hit him on lumber region and thereafter other accused, Naseer Akbar and Muhammad Kabeer, starting firing upon Sarfaraz, which hit on his hip and legs. The post-mortem reveals bullet wounds and 20 pellets wounds on the person of deceased; therefore, the aforesaid appellants-convicts can be burdened for vicarious liability. However, as all eye-witnesses have unanimously deposed role of Jahangir Akbar, that he raised 'lalkara' and fired first straight shot upon Sarfaraz, which, according to postmortem report, badly damaged the body of deceased and resulted into his death; therefore, we are of the considered view that life imprisonment awarded to Jahangir Akbar, accused, shall not meet the ends of justice; hence, he is awarded death sentence as 'Qisas' under section 302(a),A.P.C. for the commission of murder of Sarfaraz, deceased, and while keeping in view the overall facts and circumstances of the case, life imprisonment awarded to Naseer Akbar and Muhammad Kabeer, along with other sentences, is maintained. The sentence awarded to Muhammad Arshad, appellant-convict, is also maintained. However, life imprisonment awarded to Muhammad Tariq, accused, is not justified because his presence at spot is not proved, as discussed in paragraph No.22, supra. In such state of affairs, sentence of life imprisonment, awarded to Muhammad Tariq, accused, is not maintainable, thus, while extending benefit of doubt, he is acquitted of the charges leveled against him under case FIR No.174/2005.
27.
 The upshot of above discussion is that Appeal No.41/2016, filed by complainant, is partly accepted, Jahangir Akbar, accused, is awarded death sentence as 'Qisas' under section 302(a), A.P.C. for the murder of Sarfaraz, deceased, and the impugned judgment dated 28.07.2016, to the extent of other appellants-convicts, namely, Naseer Akbar, Muhammad Kabeer and Muhammad Arshad, is maintained. The other Appeal No.39/2016, filed by appellants-convicts, is also partly accepted to the extent of Muhammad Tariq, accused, and he is acquitted of the charge, whereas the same to the extent of other appellants-convicts, stands dismissed. A copy of the instant judgment shall be annexed with other relevant file. The record of the Court below shall be sent back forthwith.

80,"IMDAD ALI Versus Mst. SAKINA","June 2, 2017","KARACHI HIGH COURT SINDH"," Honorable Justice Fahim Ahmed Siddiqui ","2018 MLD 1361","JUDGMENT
 FAHIM AHMED SIDDIQUI, J.---
Through the instant petition, the petitioner has called in question the order dated 16-10-2015 passed by the Family Court-III, Mehar, which was upheld under the impugned judgment dated 25-04-2016 passed by the learned District Judge, Dadu. The learned Family Judge allowed the Guardianship Application of the respondent No.1 and custody of minor namely Aisha was ordered to be handed over to the respondent No.1 with visitation rights of the petitioner limited to 1st Saturday of every month.
2.
 The matrix of facts is that the Respondent No. 1 filed a Guardianship Application bearing No. 01/2014 before the aforementioned Family Court praying for her appointment as guardian of the person and property of minor baby Aisha, aged about 3 years at that time. During dependency of their application, the respondent No. 1 succeeded in getting a decree of dissolution of marriage by way of Khula. However, the guardianship case proceeded and ultimately decided in favour of respondent No. 1. The petitioner has challenged the verdict of the learned Family Court by preferring a Family Appeal bearing No. 27/2015 before the learned District Judge, Dadu but the same was also dismissed through impugned judgment.
3.
 The learned counsel for the petitioner addressed the court at length. The gist of his arguments is that the court of the first instance did not consider the welfare of minor adequately, which is the prime duty of the Court at the time of disposal of a guardianship application. According to him, the children in the family of responding No. 1 do not get a proper education, and this fact is admitted by one of the witness namely Ghulam Hussain.
4.
 The learned counsel for the respondent while opposing the instant petition has argued that the order and judgment passed by the lower forums are correct and proper. According to him, there is no illegality or irregularity in the findings of both the Courts below. According to him, the respondent No. 1 is taking care of the other two girls properly, and they are getting a good education in a school. Regarding rights of visitation, the contention of the learned counsel for the respondent No.1 is that the same may be enhanced if necessary.
5.
 I have gone through the entire material placed before me in the light of the arguments advanced by both the able members of the bar. As per record, after marriage, the respondent No.1 lived with the petitioner for some time, and during the continuity of their marriage, the couple was bestowed with three daughters. After the passage of time, the relations between spouses turned rough, and the respondent No.1 claimed that petitioner turned her out of the marital abode, with the two minor children while baby Ayesha remained with the petitioner. Whatever the reason it is, the marital bond is not in existence now, and parties appear to be badly antagonistic to each other. After segregation of the family, the respondent No. 1 started a legal battle for the custody of her remaining daughter in which she subsequently succeeded.
6.
 It is worth noting that the petitioner is willing to keep baby Aisha, but he does not show his eagerness to keep the remaining two daughters with him. I am of the view that it will be better for the sisters to live together instead of separating them from each other. In this way, they will be enjoying the company of their siblings and will grow up with a sense of sisterhood and a better understanding and harmony with each other.
7.
 The learned counsel for the petitioner emphasized upon the welfare of the minor by submitting that the education of baby Aisha will be badly suffered in custody of respondent No.1. In this respect, he quoted a witness produced by the petitioner before the trial court. It is worth noting that education of a minor depends upon the maintenance provided by the father of the minor. If the petitioner is willing to provide a better education for his children, he may do so by bearing the cost of education of his choice. The petitioner cannot establish that the remaining two girls are not getting proper education and if it is so then again the responsibility goes to the petitioner, as it is his duty to maintain his children properly. Another aspect of the case is important if the respondent No.1 is a good and proper person for keeping the custody of two daughters of the petitioner then how she cannot be a good and proper person for keeping the third daughter of the petitioner.
8.
 It is worth mentioning that for the upbringing of the girl child, it is necessary that she will remain under the supervision of a matron and a mother is a natural matron for her children. It has also come on record that after the dissolution of her marriage, the respondent No. 1 has yet not married again and can devote all her time for looking after and upbringing of her three daughters. According to sharia, the maintenance (kifalat) is the responsibility of father while brooding (hizanat) is the responsibility of mother, and a male child needs the care of his mother up to a certain age but a female child needs the requirement of 'brooding' up to her puberty and even up to her marriage.
9.
 So far the right of visitation is concerned, no doubt it is the right of a father to enjoy the company of his daughter and to be well acquainted and familiarized with her. I am of the view that the visitation of once in a month is to be revised, as such the learned trial Court is directed to arrange meetings of the petitioner with baby Aisha twice a month on first and third Saturday of the month or any other day with the same terms and condition as per original order passed by learned Family Judge. In my humble view, the court premises is the last place to be selected for the purpose of the meeting. If possible, it is better to select some other place for the meeting of minor like the school of the minor or any other place seems to be proper to the trial court, considering the aim of safety and security of minor and ease and facility to the parties.
10.
 The outcome of the above discussion is that there is no illegality in the order and judgment passed by the two forums below, as such the instant petition is disposed in above terms with no order as to cost.

The appellant through this appeal has challenged the sales-tax Order-in-Appeal No.63/2016-17 dated 13.10.2016 passed by the learned Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals-III), RTO, Rawalpindi, whereby he rejected the appeal. The appellant has now contended that:--
""..2)
 That the assessing officer was failed to mention specific provision of law in which the order passed by the learned ACIR, which is not appreciable by the apex court.
3)
 That the appellant deals in ""used auto parts/scrap"" where the provisions of Rule 58T of Sales Tax Special Procedure Rules, 2007 does not apply. Hence, the entire proceeding is based on wrong principle which is unlawful and against the basic principle of natural justice.
4)
 That both the authorities below decide the instant case while considering ""auto parts"" and ""used auto parts"" being the same thing (as assessed under PCT heading 8708.9990), however, the directorate General of Customs valuation categorically differentiate between the both. Hence, the contention/ understanding of both the authorities below are not correct and against the facts of the case.
 Reliance:
 Valuation Ruling No.D(v)Misc/1/2006 Dated 03/11/2006
 Valuation Ruling No.711/2015 Dated 29/01/2015
5)
 That the Appellant/taxpayer imported Goods under HS Code 8407.3400, which is not covered within the definition of ""Auto Parts and Accessories"" as mentioned in Sr. No.4 of Chapter XIII of Sales Tax Special Procedure Rules, 2007.
6)
 That under sub-Rule (8) of Rule 58T of Sales Tax Special Procedure Rules, 2007, the person who engaged in sales and purchase of such goods shall file quarterly sales tax return. However, the appellant being not falls/covered under provisions of Rule 58T file his sales tax return on monthly basis.

Whereby the competent authority has directed not to charge, levied or paid further tax @ 1% on taxable supplies made to end consumers. Hence, the chargeability of further tax is unlawful and against the facts of the case.
8)
 That the imposition of penalty under section 33 and default surcharge under section 34 of the Act is unlawful and without any jurisdiction.
9)
 That the learned assessing officer failed to establish the element of mens-rea which is mandatory condition of imposing the penalty.""
2.
 Brief facts of the case as per impugned orders are that during scrutiny of sales tax returns of the appellant for the period 10/2013 to 12/2015, it was observed that being importer of auto parts, the appellant failed to pay extra sales tax of Rs.2,474,307/- @ 2% of the value of supply in violation of sections 3(5), 6, 7, 8, 22 and 23 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 read with Rule 58T(1) of the Sales Tax Special Procedure Rules, 2007 as amended vide S.R.O. 896(I)/2013 dated 04.10.2013. It was further observed that the applicant made taxable supplies for the value of Rs.2,675,447/- to un-registered persons during the months of 7/2013 and 8/2013 but failed to pay further tax of Rs.26,754/- in violation of sections 3(1A), 6(2), 22, 23 and 26(1) of the Act ibid. Therefore, show-cause notice was issued for violation of above provisions of law confronting recovery of the above amount along with default surcharge and penalty. Contravention proceedings so initiated culminated in passing of the impugned order whereby above amount was established and held to be recoverable. The taxpayer being dissatisfied with order of Assessing Officer, filed appeal before the learned CIR(A), who
 vide
 his
 impugned order dismissed appeal in the
 following
 manner:--
 ""I have perused the impugned order, grounds of appeal and submissions tendered by the AR and DR. The learned counsel for the appellant argued that extra tax and further tax was not payable in case of supply of used auto parts. It has been contended that the provisions of S.R.O. 896(I)/2013 dated 04.10.2013 were not applicable in his case as he has imported and supplied ""Used Auto Parts"" whereas, the description of goods has been specified in the said S.R.O. as ""Auto Parts"". In this regard, it has been observed that the description of goods at serial No.(4) of the Table of said notification has been specified as ""Auto Parts and Accessories"". Thus, no distinction has been made between ""Used"" and ""new"" auto parts for the purpose of chargeability of extra tax. Therefore, the stance of the appellant has not been found tenable. As far as the issue of non payment of further tax is concerned, the stance of the appellant has not been found supported by any evidence. Hence, the order passed by the assessing officer is confirmed and the appeal accordingly stands rejected being devoid of merit.""
 Being dissatisfied with the above findings of learned CIR(A), the instant appeal has been filed by appellant before this Tribunal.
3.
 During the course of hearing, learned counsel for the taxpayer appeared and reiterated the grounds of appeal. In support of his contention, he furnished the copies of Notification of Sales Tax bearing S.R.O. No.896(I)/2013 dated 04.10.2013 by submitting that provisions of said S.R.O. were not applicable in his case as he has imported and supplied ""Used Auto Parts"" whereas, the description of goods has been specified in the said SRO as ""Auto Parts"". He further in support of his version furnished Valuation Ruling No.711/2015 determining the customs values of old and used auto parts. Accordingly, he prayed that the impugned orders of the authorities below may be annulled.
4.
 In rebuttal, the learned DR, Mr. Muhammad Akram, representing the Department, vehemently opposed the contention of learned AR. He submitted that the Valuation Ruling No.711/2015 relied by the learned AR relates to the custom valuation of old and used auto parts, which is not applicable in the instant case as the case in hand is of sales tax; not of the custom, however, S.R.O. 396(I)/2013 dated 04.10.2013 quoted by the learned AR is only for sales tax which has rightly been applied to the appellant's case as there is no bifurcation between used and new auto parts in the description of goods in said SRO. By supporting the impugned order of learned CIR(A), learned DR submitted that the learned CIR(A) while passing impugned order also confirmed that no distinction has been made between ""Used"" and ""new"" auto parts for the purpose of chargeability of extra tax. Accordingly, he prayed that the appeal may be dismissed being devoid of any merit.
5.
 We have heard both the parties and perused the relevant record of the case. The appeal mainly revolves around the question that whether the provisions of S.R.O. 896(I)/2013 dated 04.10.2013 are applicable to instant case or not? We have to resolve the aforesaid matter. The learned AR of the taxpayer during the court proceedings furnished the copy of valuation Ruling No.711/2015 which determines the customs values of old and used auto parts. He submitted that in the aforesaid Ruling clear distinction has been made in new and used auto parts, however, in the S.R.O. 896(I)/2013 dated 04.10.2013 there is only mention of Auto Parts and accessories, therefore, he submitted that the same is not applicable in the appellant's case, as the appellant deals in only used auto parts. The learned DR on other hand, vehemently opposed the contention of learned AR and added that the appellant is not the only one which has been charged with extra tax, but there are number of other taxpayers from whom extra tax has been recovered in accordance with the said SRO. We have considered the submissions of both the sides. We have observed that firstly the taxpayer submitted copies of bills of its different customers/traders by stating that the appellant deals in only used auto parts. Perusal of said bills shows the name and style of the appellant as ""G.F.Z. AUTO PARTS"". We have not seen any word like used/old auto parts in whole the bills. The appellant if claims to be the trader of used auto parts, he should first rename its name/style from auto parts to used/old auto parts. The appellant claiming that he is dealing in used auto parts with name/style of Auto parts challenges the SRO; that it is only for auto parts and not for used/old auto parts; is beyond acceptance. Secondly, as regards submission of custom valuation, we do not find any weight in the arguments of learned AR as the valuation determination submitted by the AR relates to Custom, however, this is the case of sales tax, therefore, the S.R.O. 896(I)/2013 dated 04.10.2013 has been applied rightly because the same is of sales tax. Perusal of the said S.R.O. shows that only one category has been mentioned at Sr.4 ""AUTO PARTS and ACCESSORIES"", which means that no bifurcation has been made between the used and auto parts. In our considered view, where there is no bifurcation made between the used/new auto parts, it is considered to be applied in both. However, the legislature while making the said SRO should have described in clear words of ""used/old"" and ""new"" for sake of swift understanding of the taxpayers. We concur with the findings of learned CIR(A), who has rightly dealt with the matter and the order needs no interference at this stage. The appeal is accordingly disposed off in the above manner.
 Ordered accordingly.

 ABDUL RASOOL MEMON, J.---
Through this constitutional petition the petitioner has impugned the judgment dated 15.10.2016 passed by IVth Additional District Judge, Karachi East in FRA No.88 of 2016 wherein appeal filed by the petitioner was dismissed and the order dated 26.07.2016 passed by IVth Senior Civil Judge/Rent Controller Karachi East in Rent Case No.355 of 2014 was maintained whereby the petitioner was directed to vacate the demised premises viz. Flat No.2, 1st Floor, Mahrukh Homes, Plot No.85-L, Block-II, PECHS, Karachi within thirty days.
2.
 Facts of the case gleaned from the record, briefly stated are that respondent No.1 filed an application under section 15(2)(ii)(iii)(b) of Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979 for ejectment of the petitioner/ tenant on the grounds of default in payment of rent from the month of May, 2014 to November, 2014 and so also alteration made in the demised premises thereby impaired the utility and value of the demised premises.
3.
 It is the case of respondent No.1 that she and the petitioner mutually entered into an agreement of sale cum tenancy on 20.04.2011, whereby respondent No.1/landlord offered to sell the demised premises for total sale consideration of Rs.106,00,000/- (rupees one crore six lacs only) out of which Rs.10,60,000/- were paid to her as part performance besides this the petitioner paid Rs.2,80,000/- out of which Rs.40,000/- as one month's advance rent/- as fixed security deposit adjustable to remaining sale consideration at the time of final payment and till then the petitioner was to pay mutually agreed rent of Rs.40,000/- and balance consideration of Rs.95,40,000/- was agreed to be paid by the petitioner within one year from 1st May, 2011 at the time of registration of sale deed. It is further pleaded that the petitioner has failed to pay the remaining amount of sale consideration within the stipulated period, therefore, respondent No.1 filed suit No.969 of 2014 against the petitioner for declaration, rescission of contract, damages in the sum of Rs.30,00,000/- and permanent injunction and rent application on the ground of default in payment of rent from May, 2014 to November, 2014 and also impairing the value and utility of the demised premises.
4.
 The petitioner filed written statement wherein challenged the maintainability of the rent application and further stated that tenancy/ sale agreement was for the sale of the demised premises and till the final payment she (petitioner) was agreed to pay monthly rent to the respondent No.1 and for default thereof no penal clause was mentioned in the agreement. The default in payment of rent was also denied that attorney of respondent No.1 and her husband visited the house of the petitioner and agreed to adjust Rs.280,000/- paid as security deposit towards the rent for the alleged period of default. The allegation of addition and alteration in the demised premises has also been denied.
5.
 In order to prove her case respondent No. 1 landlord filed affidavit of her attorney Sher Azam and one of Saleem Danish. In rebuttal the petitioner filed her affidavit in evidence. Both the parties were cross-examined by each other at length.
6.
 The learned Rent Controller framed three points one relating to relationship of landlord and tenant, the other on the ground of default and alteration in the demised premises without consent of the applicant/ respondent No. 1. Both these points were decided against the petitioner while answering point No.3 learned Rent Controller allowed the rent application vide order dated 26.07.2016. The said order was assailed in PRA No.88 of 2016 and learned IVth Additional District Judge, Karachi East vide impugned judgment dated 15.10.2016 maintained the findings of Rent Controller on points Nos.1 and 2 and dismissed the appeal, hence this petition.
7.
 The main crux of the arguments of learned counsel for the petitioner is that the learned Rent Controller did not appreciate the evidence of the petitioner wherein she has denied the relationship of landlord and tenant as the petitioner has purchased the demised premises through valid agreement from respondent No.1 and a suit for specific performance of contract filed by the petitioner is sub judice in civil court, therefore, petitioner is entitled to retain the possession of the demised premises under Section 53-A of Transfer of Property Act, 1882, but the rent controller did not give any finding on the said agreement of sale; that in case of any delay of payment of rent the tenant cannot be punished as there was no penal clause in the agreement, therefore, no default could be attributed to the petitioner. On the point of addition, alteration and damage to the demised premises, it is contended that nothing has been brought on record by cogent and convincing evidence that any damage was caused to the demised premises and only the renovation and repair work was done by the petitioner which does not come within the meaning of impairing the utility of the demised premises. Lastly, she prays for setting aside orders of both the courts. In support of her contentions she has placed reliance on the following case law.

6(sic) Learned counsel for the respondent No.1 has contended that relationship of landlord and tenant so also rate of the rent and filing of Suit No.261of 2013 have been admitted by the petitioner in the written statement and in her cross-examination. He has further submitted that in the said suit (copy whereof is placed on record), the petitioner in clear terms has admitted the tenancy and has also pleaded the payment of rent; that the petitioner in cross-examination has admitted that she has not paid the rent since May, 2014, therefore, default on the part of petitioner (tenant) has been established. It is vigorously argued that agreement for sale in question does not create any title and interest in the suit property. Per learned counsel the suit for specific performance has been filed after the orders passed by the appellate Court in January, 2017 and ultimately if the petitioner succeeds in getting the relief against the respondent No.1 by getting a decree from the civil court she can enforce the same according to law with all its consequences. He has further contended that there are concurrent findings of two courts below on the point of existence of relationship of landlord, default and impairing the utility of the demised premises and causing damage, therefore, orders passed by the Rent Controller and appellant court are in accordance with law and facts and it is not a fit case for interference by this Court in exercise of powers conferred under writ jurisdiction. He has placed reliance on the following case law.

 Shahid Mehboob v. Muhammad Ismail (2008 CLC 87 Karachi)
7(sic) I have considered the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the relevant record.
8.
 Admittedly the respondent No.1 is the owner of demised premises and the petitioner is in possession of the same. It is an admitted fact on the record that the parties mutually agreed to enter into tenancy-cum-agreement of sale dated 20.04.2011. The paragraph 3 of the agreement in question reads as under:
""3. That as has been mutually agreed between both the parties, the Vendor in consideration of above mentioned part payment -shall handover peaceful and vacant possession of the said property to the Vendee and the Vendee will thenceforth shall have, hold, occupy and enjoy peaceful possession. However, upto the date of full and final payment/settlement the Vendee will be responsible to pay mutually agreed rent of Rs.40,000/- (rupees forty thousand only). The vendee has further pay to the Vendor a sum of Rs.2,80,000/- (rupees two lac eighty thousand only) through cheque No.6982014 dated 20.04.2011 drawn on Habib Bank Ltd. Community Centre Branch, PECHS, Karachi out of which Rs.40,000/- (rupees forty thousand only) on account of one month's advance rent and Rs.2,40,000/- (rupees two lac forty thousand only) being fixed security deposit which will adjusted in the remaining sale consideration at the time of full and final payment of the said property by the vendee to the vendor.""
9.
 A bare perusal of the above paragraph of the agreement clearly reveals that up to the date of full and final payment/settlement the vendee/petitioner had agreed to pay rent of Rs.40,000/- per month. As per paragraphs 1 and 2 of the said agreement a sum of Rs.10,60,000/- were paid to respondent No.1 towards part payment of the sale consideration and remaining amount of Rs.95,40,000/- was to be paid within one year from 1st May, 2011. It is the case of the respondent No.1 that the petitioner did not pay the balance sale consideration and also stopped the payment of mutual agreed rent of Rs.40,000/- from May, 2014, therefore, she/respondent No.1 filed a suit for declaration rescission of contract and damages in the sum of Rs.30,00,000/- and permanent injunction and also filed rent case No.355 of 2014.
10.
 The petitioner in her cross-examination in clear terms has admitted that she has filed Suit No.261 of 2013 in the Court of IIIrd Civil Judge, Karachi East, copy whereof is available on record, wherein she herself has pleaded that she is bona fide and dutiful tenant in respect of the demised premises. Besides, this, in cross-examination the petitioner has also admitted the tenancy in the following terms:--
""In 2011 the tenancy agreement was executed between us and the applicant whereas I do not remember about its actual date and month. It is fact that the agreement executed between us an applicant pertains to tenancy agreement/agreement of sale. I am graduate. It is fact that clause 3 of tenancy agreement/agreement of sale shows that Rs.2,40,000/- being fixed as security deposit. It is fact Civil Suit No.261 of 2013 was filed by me in the Court of Civil Judge-III, Karachi East for permanent injunction. It is fact that the contents of Para 2 of plaint in C.S. No.261 of 2013 shows that Rs.2,40,000/- as refundable fixed deposit which is adjusted in the remaining sale consideration.""
11.
 Nothing is brought on record to show that before passing of the impugned order in FRA, the petitioner had filed any suit for specific performance of contract in respect of demised premises. However, during arguments learned counsel for the petitioner placed on record a copy of the plaint wherein neither name of the court is mentioned nor any suit number is mentioned therein while in the end of the plaint of the said suit, the date ""___.01.2017"" is mentioned so it is not clear whether the said suit of the petitioner has been admitted or otherwise. Furthermore, the petitioner in cross-examination has already admitted that she has filed a Suit No.261 of 2013 which is only for permanent injunction. Copy of the said suit is available on the record, wherein the plaintiff in Para 3 has admitted the relationship of respondent No.1 as landlord and tenant, which is reproduced hereunder.
""3. That the plaintiff always remained punctual and dutiful and proved to be a good tenant in respect of the demised property.""
In view of the above admissions of the petitioner in acknowledging her as tenant of landlord/respondent No.1, the principle of estoppel as annunciated in Article 115 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 would automatically come into play and thereby the petitioner is debarred from denying relationship as a tenant.
12.
 So far the contentions of learned counsel for the petitioner regarding purchase of demised premises by petitioner through agreement and retention of possession under the garb of it is concerned, it has come on record that the petitioner has filed her suit for permanent injunction on the basis of her tenancy without prayer of specific performance of contract. Even in her written statement in Suit No.969 of 2014 and rent Application No.355 of 2004 filed by respondent No.1 she did not specifically claim title or right to possess the property under section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act. Even otherwise, this plea was not available to the petitioner for the reason that as per title the agreement in question is tenancy/sale agreement, wherein it is in clear terms mentioned that till the final payment of the sale consideration within one year, she would pay the monthly rent at the rate of Rs.40,000/- and no clause is mentioned therein to the effect that the relationship of landlord and tenant shall be ceased after the expiry of the said period, therefore, the above contentions of learned applicant's counsel is devoid of force.
13. Now reverting to the issue of default in payment of rent and alteration in the demised premises respondent No.1 has pleaded that the petitioner paid the rent to her at the rate of 40,000/- per month up to the month of April, 2014 after that she failed to pay the rent. It is settled law that the onus placed on landlord to prove the default, stands sufficiently discharged when landlord depose on oath that tenant has not paid rent for the given period or time. In the case in hand the attorney of respondent No.1 in his affidavit in evidence has clearly stated about the default committed by petitioner in payment of rent then the burden was shifted to the tenant to prove affirmatively that she had paid or tendered the rent for the period in question. The petitioner in her written statement filed in rent application denied the default in payment of rent and stated that respondent No. l 's husband/attorney visited her house and told her to stop the payment of rents and further said that the advance of Rs.2,80,000/- be adjusted towards rents of May, 2014. The petitioner has examined herself and there is only her simple word about adjustment of advance security towards rent without any documentary proof and independent corroboration. On the contrary, she in her cross has admitted to have not produced any documentary proof to show that she has been depositing or paying the rent. She has also admitted to have not sent the rent to the applicant/respondent No.1 through money order. Answering to a question in respect of undertaking given by the husband of respondent No.1 for adjusting rent amount to security deposit, she stated that ""1 do not remember as to in which year the husband of applicant came our house. I do not remember whether I paid the rent in cash to the applicant"".
14.
 In these circumstances the findings of the Courts below are based on admission of the petitioner regarding existence of relationship of landlord and tenant and default in payment of rent.
15.
 However, regarding alteration in the premises in question without consent of the applicant/respondent No.1 the petitioner in cross-examination stated that she spent Rs.3,60,000/- over the demised premises but no evidence is on record by respondent No.1 showing that what type of addition or alteration was made by the tenant which has caused any damage to the demised premises to reduce its value or utility, therefore findings of both the Courts below to the extent of causing damage to the demised premises due to alleged addition and alteration appears to be contrary to the provisions of section 15(2)(iii) of Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979 which refers to the acts likely to impair materially the value of utility of the building.
16.
 The case law relied by the learned counsel for the petitioner is distinguishable and not applicable to the facts and circumstances of this case.
17.
 For the foregoing reasons I am of the opinion that the findings of Rent Controller and appellate Court on the point of default in payment of rent from May to November, 2014 are based on right conclusion. Learned counsel for the petitioner has failed to point out any misreading or non-reading of any evidence or any illegality or irregularity committed by both the courts below. The impugned judgment on the point of relationship of landlord and tenant and default are based on admitted facts and no exceptions can be made to the same. Consequently, this constitution petition is dismissed with no orders as to cost. The petitioner is directed to vacate the demised premises within 60 days' from the date of this order.

 MUHAMMAD SHERAZ KAYANI, J.---
Through the above titled writ petition filed under section 44 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act, 1974, the petitioner has implored the following relief:--
 ""It is, therefore,
 prayed that:--
i).
 The respondents may kindly be prohibited from cancelling the order of the Commissioner and Settlement Officer dated 24.03.2001 and 26.03.2001.

 A further direction may kindly be issued to the respondents that Notification dated 26.10.2001 has been issued without lawful authority and the respondents may be prohibited from proceeding further in the light of the aforesaid Notification. The Notification dated 14.11.2001 may kindly also be set aside as being without lawful authority, illegal and capricious. Any other relief admissible under law may also be granted.""
2.
 Precise facts, culminating into the filing of the instant writ petition, according to the petitioners are that the petitioners are residents of village Narol and in that capacity, are also the owners of the Shamilat-e-deh land as Hasb-e-Rasad Khewat and have the rights to enjoy its fruits and crops as share holders. It has been contended that in the khewat No.47, out of 184 kanal 17 marlas, land measuring 106 kanal 2 marlas was converted from Mehfooz Kahcharai to Shamilat-e-deh land vide order dated 26.03.2001. It has been further stated that out of the said land, 11 kanals land was acquired by the Government and some of the petitioners have also received compensation of their occupied land. It has been submitted that the petitioners moved an application to the Prime Minister, which was allowed and the Notification dated 16.01.1997 stood cancelled vide Notification dated 14.10.2000 but even then, vide order dated 26.10.2001 a committee has been constituted for inquiry. It has been claimed that the Notification dated 14.10.2000 has not been challenged by the respondents at any competent forum and in pursuance of the said Notification mutation No.61 has been attested, therefore, the inquiry committee ordered by the respondents is without lawful authority.
3.
 The respondents were summoned for filing written statement and the needful has been done by respondents. In the written statement filed on behalf of respondent No.6, besides refuting the claims of the petitioners it has been stated that the land in dispute has been transferred in the name of MDA vide Notification dated 17.09.1989 and the inhabitants got cancelled the said Notification, with fraud and forgery, secretly. It has been alleged that the petitioners have obtained the Notification by completing the proceedings with the connivance of the officials of the revenue department. It has been contended that presence of Notification dated 26.03.2001 the very purpose of the establishment of MDA comes to an end, therefore, the same has been cancelled by the Government.
4.
 Ch. Amjad Ali, Advocate, the learned counsel for the petitioners reiterated the facts and grounds agitated in the petition and contended that judgments of the Commissioner, Settlement dated 24.02.2001 and 26.03.2001, being judicial orders have not been challenged before the proper forum, well in time, as under Section 161 of the Land Revenue Act, 1967, the order passed by the Commissioner are appealable before the Board of Revenue, within 90 days, hence, the same have attained finality. The learned counsel maintained that out of the suit land, a piece of land measuring 11 kanals was acquired by the Allam Iqbal Open University, compensation whereof, has also been received by the petitioners. The learned counsel pressed into service the point that the Development Authority, under No.MDA/173 -78 dated 28.01.2011 moved the Deputy Commissioner/Collector, Muzaffarabad for award of land from Zero Point to Mera Tanolian -II comprising survey Nos. 279 and 380, and the award was issued, wherein, the suit land has been mentioned as 'Shamilat-e-deh'. The learned counsel maintained that the writ petition merits acceptance on the ground that the orders of the Commissioner Settlement dated 24.02.2001 and 26.03.2001, being unchallenged at any proper forum, have attained finality. The learned counsel submitted that the petitioners cannot be deprived of from their lawful rights in the garb of illegal Notifications, issued by the Government as it has been admitted in the report of the Additional Commissioner, Muzaffarabad dated 29.10.2002 that the suit land is not in the ownership of the Forests Department. The learned counsel stressed the point that the land in dispute is 'Shamilat-e-deh' land which is joint property of the inhabitants and no Government or state functionary is empowered to convert the status of the land and any such conversion shall be deemed as contrary to the constitution. In support of his submissions, the learned counsel placed reliance on the following precedent cases:--
1.
 PLD 1963 SC 322,
2.
 PLD 1963 Lah 575
3.
 PLD 1984 SC(AJ&K)77,
4.
 PLP 19 85 SC(AJ&K)56,
5.
 PLD 1985 SC(AJ&K) 6.
5.
 The learned counsel next contended that any piece of land, even owned by the Government cannot be transferred in favor of any authority or institution or individual except through an award and no charity has been provided in this regard. On this point, the learned counsel also referred the following case law:--
1.
 PLD 1987 SC 344,
2.
 PLD 1981 Lah. 336,
 While concluding his arguments the learned counsel claimed that the Government Notifications cannot override the substantive law and cannot be used to deprive the petitioners from their constitutionally granted rights and the learned counsel referred to and relied upon the following case law, in support of his assertions:--
1.
 2012 CLC 1655
2.
 2004 SCR 435
3.
 2014 SCR 921
4.
 2005 SCR 109
6.
 Refuting the claim of the petitioners, the learned legal advisor of the MDA, in written arguments, has controverted the stance of the petitioners and contended that land comprising survey No.101 measuring 80 kanals, which is 'Mehfooz Kahcharai' vide Notification dated 17.09.1989 and 16.01.1997, was transferred in favor of the Development Authority. It has been argued in the written arguments, that upon the application of the village, vide order dated 24.03.2001, the Commissioner accorded approval of the conversion/change of the status of the land from ""Mehfooz Kahcharai to Shamilat-e-deh' and against the said order, the Development Authority agitated the matter before the Government, whereupon vide Notification dated 14.11.2001, a six members committee, including the SMBR, was constituted. The learned counsel contended that the orders of the Commissioner Settlement dated 24.02.2001 and 26.03.2001 do not have any value as the land in question is `Mehfooz Kahcharai' and has been alienated by the Government through Notification dated 17.09.1989, therefore, the revenue authorities were not competent to convert the status of land from 'Mehfooz Kahcharai to Shamitat-e-deh'. The learned counsel has raised a preliminary objection upon the petition that the same has been filed on behalf of (6) persons and not on behalf of the inhabitants of the village, whereas, earlier the petitioners filed a petition in 1999 which was dismissed by this Court vide order dated 30.05.2000. The learned counsel finally craved for dismissal of the petition with costs on the ground that filing of the instant petition is an interference in the smooth working of a welfare state functionary.
7.
 The learned AAG also supported and owned the arguments raised on behalf of the learned legal advisor and contended that no illegality has been committed by the Azad Government while transferring the land in question in favor of the development authority as the land was Mehfooz Kahcharai and mere an order passed by the Commissioner, settlement is no sufficient for change/conversion of the status of the land in question.
8.
 I have heard the arguments on behalf of the petitioners, perused the written arguments filed on behalf of the AAG as well as the Legal Advisor and considered the controversy with utmost care.
9.
 It is an admitted fact that the orders of the Settlement Commissioner dated 24.02.2001 and 26.03.2001 have not been challenged before the proper forum, within the prescribed period of limitation, by the respondents. In order to conclude the controversy, relevant provision of Land Revenue Act, 1967 is reproduced, hereunder:--
""161. Appeals
. (1) save as otherwise provided by this Act, an appeal shall lie from an original or appellate order of Revenue Officer as follows, namely;
(a)
 To the collector, when the order is made by an Assistant Collector, of either grade.
(b)
 To the Commissioner, when the order is made by a Collector,
(c)
 To the Board of Revenue only on a point of law, when the order is made by a Commissioner;
10.
 The very next section; Section 162 provides limitation for appeal for either subscription, which is also reproduced, hereunder, usefully:--
""162. Limitation for appeals.
 Save as otherwise provided by this Act, the period of limitation for an appeal under section 161 shall run from the date of order appealed against and shall be :-
(a)
 Thirty days, where the appeal lies to the Collector,
(b)
 Sixty days, where the appeal lies to the Commissioner,
(c)
 Ninety days, where the appeal lies to the Board of Revenue.
11.
 It deems just and proper to probe out, as to what were the orders dated 24.03.2001 and 26.03.2001, whereupon, the heavy superstructure has been built by the petitioners. For convenience, the impugned orders and contextual correspondence is reproduced, hereunder. Under letter dated 22.02.2001, the Settlement Officer, made, certain recommendations to the commissioner Settlement. The concluding part of the letter reads as follows:--
12.
 In response to the above letter of the Settlement Officer, the Commissioner, Settlement vide order dated 24.03.2001 granted approval of the review as under:--
13.
 With the above approval, the matter was referred to the Settlement Officer and vide letter dated 26.03.2001, the Settlement Officer, directed the Tehsildar Settlement to act upon the approval of the Commissioner in the following words:--
14.
 In light of the approval granted by the Commissioner Settlement, the Settlement Officer granted approval of correction and referred the matter to the concerned Tehsildar and resultantly, correction was effected in the revenue record by the Assistant Collector/Tehsildar vide order dated 03.04.2001 and mutation No.61 was also attested as such.
15.
 A contemplate perusal of the relevant section of the Land Revenue Act, and the excerpts reproduced above, leads this Court that against the above reproduced orders of the revenue officers, the respondents were provided remedy of appeal before the Board of Revenue within 90 days but they did not bother to do the needful, hence, under the Land Revenue Act, the above orders had attained finality after expiry of the prescribed period of limitation.
16.
 It is universally celebrated principle of law that the findings of any Court/forum of competent jurisdiction, if not challenged within the prescribed period of limitation and after attaining finality, cannot be nullified by exercising administrative powers, as has been done in the instant case. This view of the Court finds support from cases reported as PLD 1969 SC 430, PLD 1992 SC 184 and PLD 2004 Lah. 815. Although, in the said authorities, judgments of the superior Courts were referred but the main principle remains that if a tribunal or court having jurisdiction, decides a matter that cannot be reversed through executive orders. In the case titled 'Ghulam Rasool and another v. Said Ahmed and others' 2012 CLC 1655 wherein, at page 374, para. 9 of the report, it has been held as under:--
""9.The basic constitutional provision, dealing with the transfer of land by the Government, is section 52(A) of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act, 1974. Subsection of this section provides that 'transfer of land by the Government or the Council shall be regulated by law'. This is mandatory under the provisions of the Constitution that for transfer of land, there must be some procedural law. It is not a sweet discretion of the Government or other public authorities to distribute the State property as charity.""
 (Underlining is mine)
17.
 The respondents have attempted to get resolved the controversy, by exercising administrative powers of the Government but the fact remains that if the land in dispute, as per the record and decision of the concerned revenue officers, is 'Shamilat-e-deh' land, the same is the property of the inhabitants of the villager proportionate of their ownership and how they can be deprived of, from their lawful right. Under section 4(14) of the Constitution, no one can be deprived of his property without adopting due process of law and providing compensation. The relevant provision reads as under:-
""4.(14). Protection of Property: (1) No person shall be deprived of his property save in accordance with law.
(2) No property shall be compulsorily acquired or taken possession of save for a public purpose, and save by the authority of law which provides for compensation therefor and either fixes the amount of compensation or specifies the principles on which and the manner in which the compensation is to be determined and given.""
18.
 In the instant case, the Notification dated 16.01.1997 is the main organ, whereby, the word 'Narol' was included and the words 'Mera Tanolian and Sangri Mera' were omitted. Vide Notification dated 14.10.2001, the above Notification dated 16.01.1997 was cancelled from its date of issuance. Meanwhile, the correction was effected in the revenue record, with the approval of the competent authority vide orders dated 24.03.2001 and 26.03.2001 and the said orders were not challenged, as provided in the relevant provision of law. In light of the above orders, the Notification dated 16.01.1997 stood nullified. The law is well settled that when the basic order is void, all the superstructure, built on it would be deemed to be void. The proposition came under the consideration of the apex court of Azad Jammu and Kashmir in case titled, Muhammad Akram and another v. Custodian Evacuee Property and 7 others, [2003 SCR 442]. Relevant observation lies at page 45 of the report which reads as follows:--
""In view of these facts, the learned Custodian was justified in law to cancel the allotment order obtained by him. In our view, the proprietary rights obtained on the basis of defective allotment order and sale-deed executed by appellant No.1 in favor of appellant No.2, on the basis of his proprietary rights Transfer order, was rightly cancelled by the Custodian because it is a celebrated principle of law that if basic order is void then all superstructure built upon such order is also liable to be set aside along with the basic order.""
19.
 So far as the question of transfer of the Shamilat-e-deh land in favour of an institution or individual is concerned, a Shamilat-e-Deh land, in-fact is in the ownership of the proprietors of the village; the Government has no right of ownership or even possession in the said entity. When, it has no right, then, it has also no authority to transfer it to another person. If we look from another angle, by accepting the fact that the land in question was 'Mehfooz Kahcharai', even then, that could not be transferred by the Government to MDA/respondent No.6. Mehfooz Kahcharai means the common land reserved for the grazing of the cattle of the villagers. In the ownership column No.4 of the Jamabandi, its entity remains as 'Shamilat-e-deh land'. So irrespective of the fact whether, it was reserved for grazing purpose or not, the character and title of the land remains same, (Shamilat-e-deh land). Mehfooz Kahcharai does not connote that the land was transferred or vested to Government. Any person or institution living outside the limits of village ""Narol"" cannot claim any title, whatsoever, upon the Shamilat- e-deh land, no matter it is used for which purpose. The proposition has been resolved by the apex Court of Azad Jammu Kashmir, in case titled 'Ghulam Rasool and another v. Said Ahmed and others' 2012 CLC 1655, wherein, at page 1659 of the report, it has been observed as under:--
""6. .. The Shamilat-e-deh, land, according to law, is a common land of the villagers and the Government or any other state authority is not empowered to transfer this land. Suchlike transfer is violative to the constitutionally guaranteed right fundamental rights of property. Therefore, the learned High Court has rightly set at naught the Notification of transfer of land.""
20.
 The present controversy, when adjudged in light of above dictum of the apex Court, this Court comes to the conclusion that the impugned Notifications have been issued without lawful authority and have no legal effect, hence, ineffective and inoperative upon the rights of the petitioners as well as the other proprietors of the village/co-sharers in the disputed land as well.
21.
 The nub of the above discussion is that the instant writ petition is accepted. The Notifications dated 26.10.2001, and 14.11.2001 , being without lawful authority, are hereby set aside. Resultantly, all proceedings conducted in furtherance of the above Notifications stand quashed.

The appellants were tried by the lower forum under sections 302, 504, 34, P.P.C. and after conviction, the sentence for life imprisonment was awarded to them.
2.
 The factual matrix of this case is that on 21.08.2004 at about 11:20 hours, complainant Oshaque Ali Abro (now deceased) lodged FIR at Police Station Rehmatpur against the appellants. He reported that Ghulam Mandi and other used to drink bhang near Shah Nawaz Bukhari-ji-Imam Bargah. He restrained them to use intoxication at the said place as it would cast a bad impression on the minds of youth, it annoyed Ghulam Mehdi and others. On the day of the incident, the complainant with Zahid Hussain Abro and Aandal Khan Bhutto were standing at the said Imam Bargah, when at about 10:45 hours, accused Ghulam Mehdi Abro with DBBL and Ali Gul Abro with SBBL guns came there. The accused Ali Gul abused the complainant and said that he would not be spared and they would kill him. Instantaneously, accused Ghulam Mehdi Abro fired from his gun upon the complainant, which hit him on his right leg knee and he fell to the ground with a cry. PWs Zahid Hussain and Aandal raised cries, due to which both the accused with their respective weapons decamped from the scene of offence towards the northern side.
3.
 The police sent the complainant to CMCH Larkana from where he was referred to Karachi for treatment. The epilogue of the incident culminated on the death of complainant on 02.9.2004 during treatment in a hospital in Karachi. As such, section 302, P.P.C. was also added in the already registered criminal case against the appellants/convicts. After the investigation, police submitted Final Report before the concerned Judicial Magistrate, and subsequently, the case was committed to Sessions Court being sessions trial. The case was entrusted to the trial court from where the sentence was awarded to the appellants.

Statement of appellant (accused) Ali Gul (Ex-26)
5.
 Mr. Asif Abdul Razzak Soomro, learned counsel for the appellant Ali Gul Abro addressed the court at length. He contended that there are several contradictions, illegality and irregularity in the trial of appellants. According to him, there was ill-will between the parties and the Fed have also come on record through the statement of accused Ghulam Mehdi. He pointed out that in the instant case no site sketch was prepared due to which it is difficult to comprehend the entire episode properly. According to him, Complainant says in FIR that he was with Zahid Hussain and Aandal but Zahid in his deposition says that he was near the house of Saleem Raza. He submitted that it has come on the record that deceased Oshaque was going with vegetables in his hand, but no other document speaks about vegetables. He also submitted that the prosecution did not examine any of the medical officers who had attended the deceased in CMCH Larkana after receiving injuries. He pointed out that as per prosecution's story the person who was armed with DBBL gun shot at the deceased and not the one who was armed with SBBL gun. He pointed out certain contradictions in the statements of the prosecution witnesses especially PW Zahid Hussain and PW Darban Ali in approaching police station and shifting to the injured (now deceased). According to him, the appellant Ali Gul remained in custody for a considerable period during the investigation, but no recovery was affected from him. He pointed out that Tapedar being an important witness ought to be examined but neither the prosecution bothered to examine him nor produced the sketch of the place of the incident due to which the place of the incident is still in vague and misery.
6.
 Mr. Ali Nawaz Ghanghro learned counsel for the appellant Ghulam Mehdi Abro also addressed the Court and pointed out certain contradictions in the depositions recorded before the trial Court. He submitted that the place of the incident is a thickly populated area, but it is surprising that no other independent witness of the locality was examined and the Investigating Officer picked only 2/3 witnesses of his choice. According to him, it appears from the record that there was no one at the time of the incident as transpires from the last lines of deposition of PW Ejaz. He submitted that as per ocular account, injury was sustained on the right leg, but the 'Memo of Injuries' indicates that the injury suffered on the right thigh. He pointed out that the PW Andal did not support the prosecution version. In the end, he submitted that the prosecution could not establish the case beyond reasonable doubt.
7.
 Mr. Faiz Muhammad Larik representing the legal heirs of the deceased also argued at some length. According to him, the FIR is actually a dying declaration, and it is hard to believe that a person who was going to die would speak a lie. According to him the prosecution witnesses Zahid and Andal took the deceased to the hospital, and both of them in their deposition supported the prosecution case. He submitted that the FIR was promptly lodged by the deceased himself in which a specific role and motive were assigned. He admitted that there are certain contradictions, but according to him the same are not fatal for the case of the prosecution. He prayed for maintaining the judgment of trial Court.
8.
 Mr. Sardar Ali Rizvi, learned APG supported the impugned judgment by submitting that the prosecution has proved the case and succeeded to bring the guilt of the accused at home. However, he frankly admitted that some illegalities have been committed during trial. Regarding merits of the case, his contention is that none of the eyewitnesses deposed that the accused were not present at the scene of offence. According to him, non-recovery of crime weapon and non-preparation of site sketch is not the fault of complainant party. Regarding enmity, his contention is that the same is a double-edged weapon, which cuts both sides.
9.
 After hearing the valuable submissions of the learned counsel of either side as well as the learned APG, I have gone through the entire available material in the records and proceedings of the trial Court. In the instant matter, the learned Additional Sessions Judge has given too much weight and stress to the FIR and declare the same as dying declaration. Before going further, I would think it proper to discuss the FIR and to find out whether the same can be termed as 'dying declaration'.
10.
 The FIR (Ex- 15/A) is considered by the prosecution and the trial Court as an important piece of evidence against the appellants in the present case and therefore, it should be observed as to whether the dying declaration given by the deceased by way of FIR is trustworthy or not. The dying declaration have various qualities. It should be clear, and it should allege against the culprits with some clarity in his mind that he was going to die. The FIR of the instant case was written by the police in a routine manner, and it is also mentioned that the deceased was in his senses and he has signed the FIR himself after verifying its content. I am of the view that such FIR does not fulfill the requirements of a 'dying declaration' as mentioned in Article 46(1) of the Qanun-e-Shahadat.
""46. Cases in which statement of relevant fact by person who is dead or cannot be found, etc., is relevant.
 Statements, written or verbal, of relevant facts made by a person who is dead, or who cannot be found, or who has become incapable of giving evidence or whose attendance cannot be procured without an amount of delay or expense which under the circumstances of the case appears to the Court unreasonable, are themselves relevant facts in the following cases:-
(1) When it relates to cause of death. When the statement is made by a person as to cause of his death, or as to any of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death, in cases in which the causes of that person's death comes into question. Such statements are relevant whether the person who made them was or was not, at the time when they were made, under expectation of death, and whatever may be the nature of the proceeding in which the cause of his death comes into question.
 (2) ...........""
11.
 It has come on the record that the deceased himself has gone to the police station and lodged FIR. The injury was received to him on a non-vital part, meaning thereby because of such injury he was not under an expectation of death at the time of lodging of FIR.
12.
 However, there is another aspect of the case that pertains to charge. In the instant case, the trial court has framed the charges twice because of the new development that is the death of complainant. I have sketched out the different stages of trial in a tabular form in paragraph 4. Amongst those stages, the following are important:
1.
 FIR lodged on
 :
 21-08-2004
2.
 Inquest, post-mortem etc.
 :
 02-09-2004
3.
 Accused arrested on
 :
 26-11-2004
4.
 First charge under section 324, P.P.C. framed on
 :
 15-12-2005
5.
 Deposition of PW Ghulam Din on
 :
 18-02-2006
6.
 Deposition of PW Aandal on
 :

7.
 Amended charge under section 302 on
 :
 17-01-2007
8.
 Adoption of previous evidence on
 :
 20-08-2007
13.
 From the above details, it is clear that the first as well as amended charges were framed long after the death of the deceased. It is also clear from the above position of affairs that the deposition of two witnesses was recorded on the basis of the previous charge when the disease was already expired. I am of the view that the statements of PWs Ghulam Din and Andal was recorded at a time when the deceased were already expired, as such at that point the previous charge would not cover the depositions so recorded. The amended charge was also framed afterwards, meaning thereby that at the time of recording of the deposition of these two important witnesses there was no charge at all. Although, the fact of the death of the deceased Oshaque Ali has come in the deposition of these two witnesses, but it will make no difference. I am of the view that in a trial without charge, it can be said that a person who has convicted for an offence where such a grave mistake has been committed must not have been able to defend himself properly. I am of the view that there exists much probability of misleading in the mind of accused, and an opportunity of a fair trial was not provided to him. At this juncture, I would like to reproduce section 232 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (here in after referred as 'the Code'):
232. Effect of material error
: (1) If any Appellate Court, or the High Court [or the Court of Session] in the exercise of its powers of revision or of its powers under Chapter XXVII is of opinion that any person convicted of an offence was misled in his defence by the absence of a charge or by an error in the charge, it shall direct a new trial to be had upon a charge framed in whatever manner it thinks fit.
(2) If the Court is of opinion that the facts of the case are such that no valid charge could be preferred against the accused in respect of the facts proved, it shall quash the, conviction.
14.
 Under article 10-A of the Constitution of Pakistan, a fair trial is the right of the accused and if there is a minor probability of misleading in his defence due to an error of prosecution or Court, it cannot be said that the opportunity of a fair trial was offered to accused. I am of the view that the defect of trial in the present case is not curable and the same does not cover under the provision of section 535 of the Code, which reads as:
""535. Effect of omission to prepare charge
: (1) No finding or sentence pronounced or passed shall be deemed invalid merely on the ground that no charge was framed, unless, in the opinion of the Court of appeal or revision, a failure of justice has in fact been occasioned thereby.
(2) If the Court of appeal prevision thinks that a failure of justice has been occasioned by an omission to frame a charge, it shall order that a charge be framed, and that the trial be recommenced from the point immediately after the framing of the charge.""
15.
 I am of the view that it amounts to force an accused not only to face a trial without charge but also face a conviction followed a sentence of life imprisonment, which is certainly a 'failure of justice' and the same is amounting to depriving a citizen of Pakistan from his valuable right of fair trial. In this respect, I would like to take reliance from a case reported as Saeedullah v. Asfandiyar and another (2017 PCr.LJ Note 5).
16.
 It is very much clear from the above referred provisions of law that in absence of a proper charge, there would be no other option but to remand the case for a new trial after framing a proper charge. I therefore set aside the conviction and sentence awarded to the appellants and remand back the case to the trial Court with the direction to frame the charge afresh and proceed de novo trial by putting the case on fast track and conclude it within a period of six months. Before pronouncement of judgment by the trial Court, the appellants were on bail and their bail will remain intact on the same terms and conditions, however they have to execute a fresh bond of surety up to the satisfaction of trial Court.

 MUHAMMAD HASHIM KHAN KAKAR, J.---
 The instant service appeal under Section 5 of the Judicial Service Tribunal Act, 1989 has been preferred by appellant Mrs. Tahira Parveen Baloch, ex-District and Sessions Judge against the notification dated 23rd December 2014 (""the impugned notification""), issued by the respondent, whereby she was compulsorily retired from service, which reads as under:
""Consequent upon completion of departmental inquiry against Mrs. Tahira Parveen Baloch, District and Sessions Judge (BPS-21), Killa Saifullah, the Hon'ble Chief Justice/Authority having found her guilty of ""misconduct"" as defined under section 2(1)(f) of the Balochistan Civil Servant (Efficiency and Discipline) Rules, 1992 has been pleased to impose upon her major penalty of compulsory retirement from service as envisaged under Rule 4(b)(ii) of the ibid Rules, with immediate effect.""
2.
 The relevant facts, for disposal of the instant appeal, are that the appellant joined District Judiciary as a Civil Judge in the year 1987 and, subsequently, promoted to the rank of Senior Civil Judge in the year 1993, as Additional District and Sessions Judge in the year 1995 and, finally, as District and Sessions Judge in the year 2006. While posted as a District and Sessions Judge/Presiding Officer, Labour Court, Sibi, she was served with a charge sheet dated 7th December 2009, incorporating the following statement of allegations:
""1.
 That while you were posted as District and Sessions Judge, Kharan, you were transferred on 16-05-2009 and, accordingly, you left the charge on 19-05-2009, but on query from Accounts Section of that Division, it transpired that after relinquishing the charge, you on 22-05-2009 withdrew an amount of Rs.3,80,286/- in cash in different heads without adopting proper procedure and, reportedly, the said amount has not been utilized for any official purpose, which shows that you have embezzled the said amount.
2.
 That a complaint was received from Lawyers Action Committee, Dera Allah Yar, wherein it has been mainly alleged that you, in the capacity of District and Sessions, Dera Allah Yar, w.e.f. 28-06-2009 to 24-10-2009, was enjoying extremely bad reputation. The complaint reflects that you obtained bribe in different cases through your Stenographer, namely, Rehmatullah or other sources.
3.
 Furthermore, in the said complaint, it has been stated that you have obtained an amount of Rs.200,000/- from the contractor for the purpose of purchasing Air Conditioners for Court rooms as well as Judges residence at Dera Allah Yar, but the said amount has again not been utilized; meaning thereby you have embezzled the said amount as well.
4.
 That the allegations, made against you, are of grave in nature, which reflect that your conduct is prejudicial to good order of service discipline and come within the definition of 'misconduct' as defined under the Efficiency and Discipline Rules, 1992.""
3.
 The Inquiry Officer found the appellant guilty of misconduct in his Enquiry Report dated 8th April, 2010 with the following words:
""Thus in considered estimation, she had committed an act of 'misconduct' amounting to corruption as defined under E&D Rules, by embezzling an amount of Rs.01,13,810/- while posted at Kharan Station and amount of Rs.02,00,000/- while posted at Dera Allah Yar.""
Similarly, the Authorized Officer, while agreeing with the findings of the Inquiry Officer, recommended to the Authority 'major penalty of the appellant with the following conclusion:
""Overall assessment of the enquiry stands proved against the Officer, who is actively involved in direct corruption and such acts cannot be condoned or a lenient view taken since the same would shake the confidence of the public in the judiciary.""
4.
 The Authority once again provided an opportunity of personal hearing to the appellant and, finally, the whole process culminated into compulsory retirement of the appellant vide order dated 23rd December, 2014 with the following words:
""The charges stand proved against the officer and I need not to go in detail. However, a bare perusal of the same would show that the charges are highly serious in nature and by no stretch of imagination it can be expected from a person holding the sensitive post of District and Sessions Judge, to act in such an illegal manner by involving herself in such corrupt practices on large scale. All this smacks bad smell and amounts to bring a bad name to the Judiciary. And thus, it unhesitatingly are the acts falling within the definition of 'misconduct' as defined under the Balochistan Civil Servants (Efficiency and Discipline) Rules, 1992. Although the delinquent Officer has put certain excuses by making an attempt to absolve herself, but same were not found satisfactory by the learned Authorized Officer and I also concur with his such findings.
As regards the quantum of penalty in my estimated opinion a penalty of compulsory retirement from service would commensurate with the gravity of the acts on the part of delinquent officer.""
5.
 Learned counsel for the appellant contended that the impugned notification is liable to be set aside, being based on the findings of an enquiry, which was also conducted in a very casual, cursory and discriminatory manner, that too, without observing the provisions of the Balochistan Efficiency and Discipline Rules, 1992 (""the E&D Rules""). According to learned counsel, the appellant has been made scapegoat on the basis of minor irregularities, which could easily be ignored in view of the brilliant and unblemished service track record of the appellant. While concluding his arguments, he further submitted that the evidence, furnished during the course of enquiry, is required to be reappraised in view of the fact that the findings of learned Enquiry Officer are not supported by reliable and cogent pieces of evidence.
6.
 On the contrary, learned Assistant Advocate General stated that serious allegations, relating to the integrity, that have been found in the case of the appellant upon enquiry, are sufficient to justify the order of compulsory retirement of the appellant. He further contended that the departmental proceedings have nothing to do with the compulsory retirement, as the decision regarding compulsory retirement was taken by the Competent Authority, after careful consideration of overall performance, service record of the appellant and the enquiry report as well as the recommendations.
7 
 Keeping in view the submissions made on behalf of the parties, we have not only perused the available record, but also minutely gone through the personal file and Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs) of the appellant in view of the principle that the law requires the Authority to consider the 'entire service record' of a Judicial Officer, while assessing whether he/she can be given compulsory retirement. Admittedly, the enquiry was conducted by a Judge of the High Court and the recommendations for imposing major penalty was also given by a sitting Judge of the High Court and the 'Authority', after fulfilling all the legal formalities, has passed the impugned notification, however, in the interest of justice, we have also gone through the relevant record and found the following facts:
(i)
 It appears that, at the time of joining the District Judiciary, the date of birth of the appellant, as per her matriculation certificate, was 20th May 1957 and in this regard, the request of the appellant for correction of her date of birth from 20th May 1957 to 20th May 1959, after joining service, was declined by the then Secretary, Services and General Administration Department, Government of Balochistan vide letter dated 10th September, 1997, however, subsequently, the appellant, without permission of the Competent Authority, has succeeded to insert her date of birth as 20th May, 1959 in her service record. 
(ii)
 That, while performing her duties as Additional District and Sessions Judge, Sibi, she was suspended by the High Court of Balochistan on account of wilful absence and misconduct vide order dated 13th July, 1998. Though the then Authorized Officer, in view of the enquiry conducted by the Enquiry Officer, recommended her removal from service, however, the then Hon'ble Chief Justice, while taking a lenient view, ordered withholding of annual increments for a period of three years vide order dated 2nd December 1998.
(iii)
 That in the year 2005, the appellant was superseded by her juniors: viz, M/s. Zaheer-ud-Din Kakar, Muhammad Iqbal Shahwani (late), Nazeer Ahmed Langov and Rozi Khan Barrech, who were promoted as District and Sessions Judges (BPS-20) vide Notification No.2243/120-Estt/Admn dated 23rd November, 2005.
(iv)
 The appellant was promoted as District and Sessions Judge on officiating basis vide notification dated 14th March 2006, but, subsequently, on account of poor performance, she was reverted to her earlier position i.e. Additional District and Sessions Judge and her departmental representation was also rejected by the then Hon'ble Chief Justice vide order dated 27th November, 2006. The said notification reads as under:
""The Hon'ble Chief Justice High Court of Balochistan, has been pleased to withdraw the Notification No.760-61/120-Estt: Admn dated/14-03-2006 to the extent of appointment of Mrs. Tahira Parveen Baloch and Mr. Abdul Rasheed Umrani, as District and Sessions Judges (B-20) on officiating basis and accordingly they stand reverted to their original posts of Additional District and Sessions Judges (B-19) with immediate effect.""
(v)
 That, while declaring the appellant an officer of average performance, the following remarks were given by the then Hon'ble Chief Justice in her ACR of the year 2010:
""That though her judicial work was satisfactory. She faced certain complaints and doubts were raised about her integrity""
Similarly, in her ACR of the year 2011, the then Hon'ble Chief Justice in the column of 'Pen Picture' observed as under:
""She must desist from approaching people and her superiors for her personal advancement.""
(vi)
 That the appellant was once again suspended with immediate effect on 22nd December, 2014, when she was performing her duties as District and Sessions Judge, Killa Saifullah vide Notification No.3893/PF/Admn:, however, due to compulsory retirement of appellant on 23rd December, 2014, the proceedings were stopped and kept in abeyance.
8.
 The perusal of personal file of the appellant reveals that the same is full of explanations, show cause notices, warnings and complaints received by the Hon'ble Chief Justice from time to time from different quarters/corners regarding integrity of the appellant, however, keeping in view length of service of the appellant, while taking lenient views, warnings were issued to her from time to time and last warning was issued to her on 13th May, 2009.
9.
 It is by now settled that the law requires the authority to consider the entire service record of the employee, while assessing whether he/she can be given compulsory retirement. It is also by now settled that the case of a Judicial Officer is required to be examined, treating him/her to be differently from other civil servants, as they are performing the sacred duty of rendering justice among the general people. Their honesty and integrity is expected to be beyond doubt. It should be reflected in their overall judicial work and reputation. The nature of judicial service is such that it cannot afford to suffer continuance in service of persons with doubtful integrity, or who have lost their utility in order to keep the stream of justice unpolluted. Similarly, a Judge cannot be stamped with the label of 'doubtful integrity' in absence of tangible materials, however, sometimes, such materials do not come forth and in such situation, the general impression of the Judge as a corrupt Judge in the mind of general public is alone sufficient for his/her compulsory retirement by the Competent Authority.
10.
 While considering the case of the appellant on the touchstone of the aforementioned principles of law and having gone through her entire service record, we are of the considered view that the appellant remained an average officer throughout her servicer career and could never improve. She was also not enjoying a good reputation in the eyes of general public as well as her superiors. She had been given adverse entries regarding her integrity/reputation as not good in the years 2010 and 2011.
11.
 It may be added that though the compulsory retirement has been prescribed as major penalty in the Balochistan Efficiency and Discipline Rules, 1992, yet it differs from dismissal and removal from service, as it does not involve penal consequences inasmuch as the person compulsorily retired is entitled to pension and other retiral benefits proportionate to the period of service standing to his/her credit. Even otherwise, as per date of birth in the matriculation certificate, the appellant has already attained the age of superannuation on 19th May, 2017.
12.
 While reverting to merits of the case, admittedly, the enquiry in the instant case was conducted by a Judge of the High Court and his findings regarding guilt of the appellant was concurred by a Senior Judge of this Court, as such, there is hardly any chance to make the allegation of non-application of mind and mala fides. The overall as well as documentary evidence, brought on record, during the course of the enquiry, is sufficient to connect the appellant with the commission of misconduct during her service and the Enquiry Officer as well as the Authorized Officer has appreciated the evidence in its true perspective.
 As a sequel to the above reasons and conclusions, the appeal, being without merit, is dismissed.

However, vide judgment dated 27.05.2014 passed by the Judicial Magistrate, Rawalpindi the petitioner was acquitted along with the others nominated as accused therein. The respondent Muhammad Akbar alias Aku challenged their acquittal in appeal before the honourable High Court, but his appeal was dismissed vide Order dated 26.01.2016.
5.
 The respondent/complainant, thereafter filed a complaint under section 7 of Offence of Qazf (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979 (hereinafter referred to as the said Ordinance) against the petitioner and several others on 09.05.2016. Cursory evidence was recorded and notice was issued to the SHO Police Station, Kalar Syedan to inquire the matter and submit his report. After going through the said report and hearing arguments of the learned counsel for the complainant/respondent, the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Rawalpindi admitted the complaint and summoned the petitioner and others for 29.08.2016. Hence the instant Revision Petition.
6.
 It may be mentioned that the petitioner along with several others has been, thereafter, charged on 04.01.2017 for committing offence punishable under section 7 of the said Ordinance and directed to face trial thereunder. However, a bare perusal of the charge reveals that the caption of the charge has been mentioned as under:-
""FIR. No. 112 dated 25.02.2009. Under section 302/324, P.P.C. Police Station Rata Amral, Rawalpindi"".
It could not be ascertained from the available record, what is the connection of that FIR with the instant charge of Qazf.
7.
 I have heard learned counsel for the parties as well as learned Additional Prosecutor General. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that:-
*
 the impugned order passed by learned trial court is not sustainable in the eye of law and it seems that the same has been passed without applying judicial mind;
*
 the learned trial court was supposed to record proper reasons for summoning the petitioner but the same was not done.
*
 the impugned order passed by the Trial Court is based on surmises and conjectures and the reason assigned in support thereof is not sustainable under the law and is liable to be set aside.
*
 The petitioner registered the case firstly on the direction of senior officials and secondly by following the relevant law, for which he had due protection by law and Police Rules. He placed reliance on section 154, Cr.P.C., Rule 25 of Police Rules, 1934 and Articles 171-173 of Police Order, 2002.
*
 the petitioner alleged nothing against the respondent No.2 and investigated the case by following the police rules and norms of natural justice.
*
 as per definition of Qazf, the proceedings under section 7 of the said Ordinance can only be initiated against the person who alleges zina.
*
 the practice of victimizing the investigating agencies' should not be allowed.
*
 the impugned order referred to above is not only illegal and improper but also void at the same.
*
 the actual facts were not appreciated by the Learned trial court while passing the above said impugned order.
*
 pendency of proceedings against the petitioner is an abuse of the process of law.
*
 actually, the petitioner is totally innocent and has been made escape goat in this case.
*
 the petitioner has the only option to seeks the proper remedy from this Honourable Court.
8.
 Learned counsel for the respondent/complainant contended that:-
*
 there is no illegality whatsoever in the summoning order.
*
 the FIR was registered against the complainant/respondent Muhammad Akbar with the allegation of Zina and he was arrested in the same and sent for trial;
*
 the investigation was conducted by the petitioner and found defective during the course of inquiry of the learned Additional Sessions Judge as the same was ordered by the Honourable Chief Justice of Supreme Court of Pakistan;
*
 it is another admitted fact that the respondent/complainant Muhammad Akbar was acquitted in the FIR and the allegations were found false and concocted vide judgment dated 25.02.2010 of the Additional Sessions Judge Rawalpindi;
*
 from the above said facts which were incorporated by the private complaint and in cursory statement which has been established that the Offence of Qazf was committed against the respondent with the active connivance of the police officials including the I.O. (petitioner);
*
 that the some other Offence i.e. under sections 500, 506, 508 and 496C were also committed during the course of investigation of the above said and those can be tried together with the Offence of Qazf;
*
 the acquittal of the accused under the charges of sections 155(c) and 155(d) of the Police Order, 2002 by the Magistrate would not come in the way as they were not charged in the above said sections and even the charges of abetment and the facilitation are available in the shape of complaint and cursory statement;
*
 The false allegation of Zina levelled against the respondent/ complainant Muhammad Akbar has ruined the life of the respondent and caused disrespect and disgrace to the good reputation of the family.
*
 The petitioner has played a very active role and any opinion regarding the merits of the case would affect the case of either side mere the charge can be amended at any stage of the case and in case of non framing the charge, accused can be convicted in minor nature of charges; and
*
 the summoning Order is based on sound reasoning and sufficient evidence available on the record, therefore, the summoning Order of the trial Court may kindly be upheld.
9.
 The learned Additional Prosecutor General, Punjab for the State supported the impugned order.
10.
 I have anxiously perused the record in the light of submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties. In this connection it is pertinent to mention that as provided in sections 154-156, Cr.P.C., the police officer incharge of a police station is legally required to register a case after receiving information of commission of cognizable offence from any source and has to investigate and submit challan before the Illaqa Magistrate. The investigation has to commence soon after such information. In this background the petitioner who was admittedly posted as SI at Police Station Kalar Syedan at that time and had received an application from the higher ups, duly marked to him, was not supposed to postpone or deny registration of the case as required under the law. Since prima-facie a cognizable offence was reportedly committed, he was duty-bound to proceed against the accused and register FIR under the provision of section 154, Cr.P.C. Thereafter, he had to take various steps to investigate the matter. Article 171 of Police Order, 2002 envisages grant of a due right of protection to such officer/official and he/she cannot be made liable to any penalty or payment of damages on account of acts done in good faith in pursuance of performance of official duties legally assigned to him. Moreover, it is notable that according to Article 172 of Police Order, 2002, suits or prosecution in respect of acts done under colour of duty or in exercise of any such duty or authority of the police order, the prosecution or suit shall not be entertained or shall be dismissed if instituted after more than six months from the date of action complained of. In the instant case the FIR was registered by the petitioner after receipt of an application ""duly marked to him by the higher ups"" on 26.06.2009 while the instant complaint was lodged against him on 09.05.2016. Thus, it is delayed by six years, ten months and 13 days. In addition to this, it is worth also consideration that if the practice of victimizing the Investigating or Law enforcing agencies or for that matter, any one performing his legal or judicial duties is allowed, it will jeopardize the whole system and render it ineffective.
11.
 As discussed above, the petitioner performed his official duty for which he was admittedly appointed and which was legally assigned to him. He might have performed it in defective manner but admittedly there is nothing on record to show that he registered the FIR with any malicious design of his own. He just incorporated the contents of an application initially submitted by complainant Syed Manzoor Hussain Shah to RPO Rawalpindi who had marked the same to SDPO Kahuta and it came finally to the petitioner through SHO, Police Station Kalar Syedan. The very fact that the application was submitted to RPO Rawalpindi on 24.06.2009 and the FIR was registered on 26.06.2009 shows that the petitioner had committed no illegality, otherwise being an experienced police officer, he would have manipulated the date so as to cover the obvious delay of 22 days which was one of the reasons that the accused/respondent was acquitted by the Additional Sessions Judge, Rawalpindi. It transpires that the respondent Muhammad Akbar alias Aku was acquitted in the FIR and the allegation was found false and concocted by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Rawalpindi, but there is nothing in the said judgment that the petitioner had in any way connived, initiated or abetted in leveling the allegation of Zina or had himself originated the FIR. There is also nothing on record to show that he himself prepared any forensic report or medical report in respect of the concerned parties. So far as the submissions of learned counsel for the respondent regarding the other offences under sections 500, 506, 508 and 496-C, P.P.C. is concerned, it suffices to mention that these sections have been apparently dropped by the learned trial court and the petitioner has only been charged under section 7 of the said Ordinance. Moreover, the available record has no evidence that the petitioner played any active role or maneuvered the report. He was only one of the I.Os who had investigated the case.
12.
 It is also very pertinent to observe that cases relating to various offences are daily reported to the police and the police officer is indeed duty bound under sections 154-156, Cr.P.C. to register cases pertaining to murder, dacoity and robbery etc. and accordingly investigate into those offences but, so far, there is not a single precedent on record to show that any police official/officer has ever been charged or sentenced for committing any such offence on account of registering an FIR about commission of the same offence.
13.
 It is also pertinent to refer to the definition of section 3 of the said Ordinance, which has defined Qazf. As per record, the petitioner is neither complainant in the instant case who made or fabricated an accusation of zina against the respondent nor he has ever been a witness, to the offence of alleged zina, who was found to have given any false evidence in this respect.
14.
 It is also notable that the petitioner was acquitted by the learned Judicial Magistrate, Rawalpindi vide Judgment dated 27.05.2014 and an appeal against the same was also dismissed by the Honourable High Court vide Order dated 26.01.2016.
15.
 In view of the legal position, explained above, there is nothing incriminating whatsoever on record to proceed with the trial of the petitioner Muhammad Riaz Cheema, SI and the charge against him is groundless. Since there is no probability of the petitioner being convicted of committing the offence of Qazf, the impugned order based on misreading is not at all sustainable. Therefore, I allow this petition, preferred by petitioner Muhammad Riaz Cheema, SI, and set aside the impugned order dated 30.07.2016 passed against him by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Rawalpindi.

I. 
Introduction
[1]
 This appeal, which arises from a motor vehicle accident in British Columbia, concerns principally the application of the common law of negligence to claims for mental injury. A trial judge awarded damages for mental injury to the appellant, Mohsen Saadati, on the strength not of expert evidence, but of the testimony of lay witnesses to the effect that, after the appellant's involvement in an automobile accident caused by the respondents, his personality had changed. The British Columbia Court of Appeal reversed, holding that recovery for mental injury requires a claimant to prove, with expert medical opinion evidence, a ""recognizable [or recognized] psychiatric illness"". 
[2]
 This Court has, however, never required claimants to show a recognizable psychiatric illness as a precondition to recovery for mental injury. Nor, in my view, would it be desirable for it to do so now. Just as recovery for physical injury is not, as a matter of law, conditioned upon a claimant adducing expert diagnostic evidence in support, recovery for mental injury does not require proof of a recognizable psychiatric illness. This and other mechanisms by which some courts have historically sought to control recovery for mental injury are, in my respectful view, premised upon dubious perceptions of psychiatry and of mental illness in general, which Canadian tort law should repudiate. Further, the elements of the cause of action of negligence, together with the threshold stated by this Court in Mustaphav. Culligan of Canada Ltd., 2008 SCC 27, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 114, at para. 9, for proving mental injury, furnish a sufficiently robust array of protections against unworthy claims. I therefore conclude that a finding of legally compensable mental injury need not rest, in whole or in part, on the claimant proving a recognized psychiatric illness. It follows that I would allow the appeal and restore the trial judge's award.
II. 
Overview of Facts and Proceedings
A. Background
[3]
 On the night of July 5, 2005, the appellant was driving a tractor-truck along Front Street in New Westminster, British Columbia, when his vehicle was struck by a vehicle driven by the respondent Grant Iain Moorhead. The appellant's truck sustained significant damage, but he appeared at the time to have been uninjured. He went to a nearby hospital, but was not admitted for observation.
[4]
 This accident (""the accident"") was the second in a series of five motor vehicle collisions involving the appellant between January 2003 and March 2009, inclusive. The appellant had suffered chronic pain since the first accident, which was later aggravated by the third accident (which occurred on September 17, 2005). In 2007, the appellant sued the respondents in negligence, seeking damages for non-pecuniary loss and past income loss. Two further accidents followed in 2008 and 2009. In 2010, the appellant was declared mentally incompetent and his action was continued by a litigation guardian.
B. Judicial History
(1) 
Supreme Court of British Columbia - 2014 BCSC 1365
[5]
 The respondents collectively admitted liability for the accident, but took the position that the appellant suffered no damage. Expert evidence was tendered on behalf of the appellant to support his claim of an injury resulting from the accident, much of which the trial judge ruled inadmissible (2013 BCSC 636, 46 B.C.L.R. (5th) 392). After weighing the admissible evidence, he concluded that the appellant had not demonstrated any physical injury resulting from the accident. Citing the test for factual causation stated in Clements v. Clements, 2012 SCC 32, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 181, at para. 46, however, he did find (at para. 50 (CanLII)) that the accident caused the appellant ""psychological injuries, including personality change and cognitive difficulties"". While this finding did not rest on an identified medical cause, it was based upon the testimony of friends and family of the appellant to the effect that, after the accident, the appellant's personality changed for the worse. Once a funny, energetic, and charming individual, he had become sullen and prone to mood swings. Historically close relationships with family and friends had deteriorated. He complained of headaches.
[6]
 The trial judge further found that the appellant's mental injury was aggravated by the third (September 17, 2005) accident. Applying the principle from Bradley v. Groves, 2010 BCCA 361, 326 D.L.R. (4th) 732, he found that the mental injury originally caused by the accident was indivisible from any injury caused by that later accident. Having regard to the appellant's personality change, his loss of close personal relationships with family and friends, his age, and the period involved, the trial judge awarded him $100,000 for non-pecuniary damage. The claim for past income loss was dismissed.
(2)
 
British Columbia Court of Appeal - 2015 BCCA 393, 81 B.C.L.R. (5th) 1
[7]
 On appeal, the respondents argued (inter alia) that the trial judge erred by awarding damages for mental injury where the appellant had not proven ""a medically recognized psychiatric or psychological illness or condition"" (para. 22). The Court of Appeal agreed, adding that such an illness or condition must be demonstrated by ""expert medical opinion evidence"" (para. 32). The law in this regard, it concluded, was left unchanged by this Court's judgment in Mustapha. 
[8]
 Further, the Court of Appeal also observed (at para. 34) that, in awarding damages for mental injury, the trial judge erred by ""decid[ing] the case on a basis neither pleaded nor argued by [the appellant]"". Rather, the trial judge should have notified counsel that he was prepared to consider a claim that had not been pleaded, given the appellant an opportunity to amend his pleadings and, if the amendments were allowed, given the respondents an opportunity to call further evidence and make further submissions. 
III. 
Analysis
A. Sufficiency of the Pleadings
[9]
 Drawing from the Court of Appeal's statements regarding notice, the respondents argue that the trial judge's award for mental injury was made in breach of procedural fairness, having no basis in the pleadings or submissions at trial. While I note that the respondents did not argue this point at the Court of Appeal, as the respondents now say and as the Court of Appeal said, cases should not be decided on grounds not raised (Insurance Corp. of British Columbia v. Patko, 2008 BCCA 65, 290 D.L.R. (4th) 687, at para. 37; Rodaro v. Royal Bank of Canada (2002), 59 O.R. (3d) 74 (C.A.), at para. 60; Burgsteden v. Long, 2014 SKCA 115, 378 D.L.R. (4th) 562, at para. 17; R. v. E.M.W., 2011 SCC 31, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 542, at para. 4). This rule is an instance of natural justice: each party is entitled to know and respond to the case that it must answer (Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Renard, 2008 BCCA 343, 298 D.L.R. (4th) 216, at paras. 38-39).
[10]
 In claims for negligently caused mental injury, it is generally sufficient that the pleadings allege some form of such injury (Odhavji Estate v. Woodhouse, 2003 SCC 69, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 263, at para. 74). The appellant's Statement of Claim alleges various injuries caused by the accident, including:
h)
 such further and other injuries as may become apparent through medical reports and examinations, details of which shall be provided as they become known;
and the effects or results of the said injuries upon the Plaintiff include headaches, fatigue, dizziness, nausea and sleeplessness.
 (R.R., vol. I, at p. 7)
It also claims ""general damages for pain and suffering, loss of earning capacity past, present and future, loss of opportunity, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of physical health . . ."" (R.R., vol. I, at p. 7).
[11]
 At trial, the appellant introduced an expert report from Dr. Hiram Mok, a psychiatrist, who diagnosed the appellant with mental disorders (although it was unclear whether these disorders resulted from the accident or subsequent accidents). The appellant's written closing submissions at trial also alleged the occurrence of a psychological reaction to the accident (or in other words a mental injury):
It is submitted that if the court does not accept a proven concussion, the evidence still shows that the Plaintiff suffered from a change in mood/personality, memory loss, and cognitive difficulties as a result of the July 5 2005 accident.
If not caused by a concussion, then it must be caused by something. The only logical conclusion is that these were caused by a psychological reaction to the accident, new pains, or an aggravation of old pains.
. . .
It is therefore submitted that, on a balance of probabilities, if the court finds that Mohsen did not suffer a concussion, then the only logical conclusion is that Mohsen's problems with memory, cognition and change in behavior arose as a result of the July 2005 accident, which compounded upon the January 2003 accident injuries, and was compounded upon again in the September 2005 accident. [Emphasis added.]
(R.R., vol. I, at p. 285)
A similar line of argument was delivered in the appellant's oral submissions:
Now, the alternative argument, of course, we have is that if you don't find that a concussion has been made out, we submit that there is still evidence that he suffered chronic pain and some kind of emotional reaction, with resulting memory problems and cognitive problems, and change in mood, in the July 2005 accident, which but for the accident he would not have suffered from.
. . .
We say it's a concussion. . . . But if it's not a concussion, it's some reaction to that accident that may be compounding upon the fact that he was injured in an earlier accident back in January 2003, but something changed in this man. . . . That accident triggered that, either by way of it being a concussion or by some kind of psychological, emotional reaction to everything.
. . .
. . . Something happened to him that changed him. We say it's a concussion, but if it's not a concussion, it must be some kind of emotional psychiatric reaction, which isn't something that he could control. It clearly just came on him after the accident and caused him to become a changed individual between July and September 2005. And that is clear from the evidence of all of the family members. [Emphasis added.]
 (R.R., vol. I, at pp. 190-92)
[12]
 None of these arguments regarding a ""psychological"", ""emotional"" or ""psychiatric"" reaction elicited an objection from the respondents before the trial judge. And, in my view, the many allegations of such reaction appearing in the appellant's oral and written closing submissions, combined with the broad heads of damage alleged in the pleadings, provided ample notice to the respondents of the case which they had to answer. I see no breach of procedural fairness here. 
B. Mental Injury
[13]
 Liability in negligence law is conditioned upon the claimant showing (i) that the defendant owed a duty of care to the claimant to avoid the kind of loss alleged; (ii) that the defendant breached that duty by failing to observe the applicable standard of care; (iii) that the claimant sustained damage; and (iv) that such damage was caused, in fact and in law, by the defendant's breach (Mustapha, at para. 3). At issue here is the third element. As they argued at the Court of Appeal, the respondents say that the trial judge erred by awarding damages for mental injury that did not correspond to a proven, recognized psychiatric illness. More specifically, the Court must answer the narrow question of whether it is strictly necessary, in order to support a finding of legally compensable mental injury, for a claimant to adduce expert evidence or other proof of a recognized psychiatric illness. 
(1)
 
Recovery for Mental Injury in Negligence Law
[14]
 The early common law's posture towards claims for negligently caused mental harm was one of suspicion and sometimes outright hostility (McLoughlin v. O'Brian, [1983] 1 A.C. 410 (H.L.), at p. 433), and was ""virtually programmed to entrench primitive suspicions and prejudices about 'invisible', intangible harm"" (H. Teff, Causing Psychiatric and Emotional Harm: Reshaping the Boundaries of Legal Liability (2009), at p. 40). Mental injury was seen as ""not derived through the senses, but [as] a product of the imagination"" (Miner v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co. (1911), 18 W.L.R. 476 (Alta. S.C. en banc), at p. 478). This scepticism persisted into the last century, such that mental injury was not compensable unless accompanied by physical injury (see L. B langer-Hardy ""Reconsidering the 'Recognizable Psychiatric Illness' Requirement in Canadian Negligence Law"" (2013), 38 Queen's L.J. 583, at pp. 599-600).
[15]
 While the absolute bar to recovery for mental injury absent physical injury was eventually lifted, the suspicion which originally impelled that bar persisted, and common law courts continued to impose conditions upon recovery beyond those applied to claims for negligently caused physical injury. While, therefore, in England liability for negligently caused mental injury was first recognized as early as 1901 (Dulieu v. White & Sons, [1901] 2 K.B. 669 (Div. Ct.)), it was conditional upon ""a shock which arises from a reasonable fear of immediate personal injury to oneself"" (p. 675), or (after Hambrook v. Stokes Brothers, [1925] 1 K.B. 141 (C.A.)), ""a reasonable fear of immediate personal injury either to [the claimant, or the claimant's children]"" (p. 152). While recovery for mental injury in Canada remained parasitic to recovery for compensable physical injury well into the 20th century (e.g. Miner), by mid-century Canadian courts had also begun to permit recovery on similar conditions as English law - typically, on claimants having had at the material time a reasonable fear of physical injury to themselves or to their family (e.g. Horne v. New Glasgow, [1954] 1 D.L.R. 832 (N.S.S.C.)).
[16]
 Further obstacles to recovery for mental injury arose in English law. In McLoughlin v. O'Brian, at pp. 419-21, Lord Wilberforce posited three considerations that could limit the boundaries of compensable ""nervous shock"": the class of persons whose claims should be recognized (often referred to as relational proximity), the proximity of such persons to the accident (locational, or geographical proximity), and the means by which the ""shock"" is caused (temporal proximity) (G. H. L. Fridman, The Law of Torts in Canada (3rd ed. 2010), at p. 326). Where claimants alleged mental injury arising out of a sudden traumatic event, later judgments further distinguished between a ""primary"" victim (who was directly involved as a participant) and a ""secondary"" victim (who witnessed physical injuries caused to others) (see Alcock v. Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, [1992] 1 A.C. 310 (H.L.); and Page v. Smith, [1996] 1 A.C. 155 (H.L.)). This distinction has, however, sometimes proven difficult to apply in practice (as shown by the English law's difficulty in categorizing the status of rescuers - see White v. Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, [1999] 2 A.C. 455 (H.L.)), and has been criticized as lacking foundation in principle, having no relevance to the justice of the claimant's case (A. Beever, Rediscovering the Law of Negligence (2007), at pp. 405-7; J. Stapleton, ""In Restraint of Tort"", in P. Birks, ed., The Frontiers of Liability (1994), vol. 2, 83, at p. 95; Mustapha v. Culligan of Canada Ltd. (2006), 84 O.R. (3d) 457 (C.A.), at para. 43). That this is so has never really been disputed. As Lord Hoffmann candidly acknowledged in White, ""in this area of law, the search for principle was called off in Alcock . . . . No one can pretend that the existing law . . . is founded upon principle.""
[17]
 Other Commonwealth courts have taken a different path. The High Court of Australia expressly rejected the categories delineated by the House of Lords, preferring a more flexible foreseeability of harm test (Tame v. New South Wales, [2002] HCA 35, 211 C.L.R. 317). In New Zealand, the primary/secondary victim distinction has not been definitively considered (S. Todd et al., The Law of Torts in New Zealand (5th ed. 2009), at pp. 182-84).
[18]
 Like the English courts, Canadian courts have occasionally struggled, as Professor Klar has described, ""to find words which can clearly explain why, on the basis of arbitrary policy choices, certain types of claims seem to be too remote and uncompensable"" (L. N. Klar, Tort Law (5th ed. 2012), at p. 505 (emphasis in original)). In Beecham v. Hughes (1988), 27 B.C.L.R. (2d) 1 (C.A.), and Rhodes v. Canadian National Railway (1990), 75 D.L.R. (4th) 248 (B.C.C.A.), for example, the multi-faceted proximity analysis formalized in McLoughlin v. O'Brian found favour. In Beecham, Lambert J.A. wrote (at p. 43):
. . . I would not put the entire emphasis on ""causal proximity"", to the exclusion of ""temporal proximity"", ""geographical proximity"" or ""emotional proximity"". I would try to balance them all. A close but foreseeable emotional bond, as between a parent and child, may compensate, in the determination of the composite answer on liability, for a more remote causal proximity, as where the parent is not present when the child is injured.
[19]
 This Court has not, however, adopted either the primary/secondary victim distinction, or McLoughlin v. O'Brian's disaggregated proximity analysis. Rather, in Mustapha, recoverability of mental injury was viewed (at para. 3) as depending upon the claimant satisfying the criteria applicable to any successful action in negligence - that is, upon the claimant proving a duty of care, a breach, damage, and a legal and factual causal relationship between the breach and the damage. Each of these elements can pose a significant hurdle: not all claimants alleging mental injury will be in a relationship of proximity with defendants necessary to ground a duty of care; not all conduct resulting in mental harm will breach the standard of care; not all mental disturbances will amount to true ""damage"" qualifiying as mental injury, which is ""serious and prolonged"" and rises above the ordinary emotional disturbances that will occasionally afflict any member of civil society without violating his or her right to be free of negligently caused mental injury (Mustapha, at para. 9); and not all mental injury is caused, in fact or in law, by the defendant's negligent conduct.
[20]
 Indeed, the claim in Mustapha failed on that last element: the claimant's damage was not caused in law by (that is, it was too remote from) the defendant's breach. Mustapha thus serves as a salutary reminder that, even where a duty of care, a breach, damage and factual causation are established, there remains the pertinent threshold question of legal causation, or remoteness - that is, whether the occurrence of mental harm in a person of ordinary fortitude was the reasonably foreseeable result of the defendant's negligent conduct (Mustapha, at paras. 14-16). And, just as recovery for physical injury will not be possible where injury of that kind was not the foreseeable result of the defendant's negligence, so too will claimants be denied recovery (as the claimant in Mustapha was denied recovery) where mental injury could not have been foreseen to result from the defendant's negligence.
[21]
 It follows that this Court sees the elements of the cause of action of negligence as furnishing principled and sufficient barriers to unmeritorious or trivial claims for negligently caused mental injury. The view that courts should require something more is founded not on legal principle, but on policy - more particularly, on a collection of concerns regarding claims for mental injury (including those advanced in this appeal by the intervener Insurance Bureau of Canada) founded upon dubious perceptions of, and postures towards, psychiatry and mental illness in general: that mental illness is ""subjective"" or otherwise easily feigned or exaggerated; and that the law should not provide compensation for ""trivial matters"" but should foster the growth of ""tough hides not easily pierced by emotional responses"" (A. M. Linden and B. Feldthusen, Canadian Tort Law (10th ed. 2015), at p. 449; R. Mulheron, ""Rewriting the Requirement for a 'Recognized Psychiatric Injury' in Negligence Claims"" (2012), 32 Oxford J. Leg. Stud. 77, at p. 82). The stigma faced by people with mental illness, including that caused by mental injury, is notorious (J. E. Gray, M. Shone and P. F. Liddle, Canadian Mental Health Law and Policy (2nd ed. 2008), at pp. 139 and 300-301), often unjustly and unnecessarily impeding their participation, so far as possible, in civil society. While tort law does not exist to abolish misguided prejudices, it should not seek to perpetuate them.
[22]
 Where, therefore, genuine factual uncertainty arises regarding the worthiness of a claim, this can and should be addressed by robust application of those elements by a trier of fact, rather than by tipping the scales via arbitrary mechanisms (R. Stevens, Torts and Rights (2007), at p. 56). Certainly, concerns about ""subjective"" symptoms or about feigned or exaggerated claims of mental injury are - like most matters of credibility - questions of fact best entrusted to the good sense of triers of fact, upon whose credibility determinations of liability and even of liberty often rest. In short, such concerns should be resolved by ""a vigorous search for the truth, not the abdication of judicial responsibility"" (Linden and Feldthusen, at p. 449; see also Toronto Railway Co. v. Toms (1911), 44 S.C.R. 268, at p. 276; Stevens, at p. 56).
[23]
 I add this. As to that first necessary element for recovery (establishing that the defendant owed the claimant a duty of care), it is implicit in the Court's decision in Mustapha that Canadian negligence law recognizes that a duty exists at common law to take reasonable care to avoid causing foreseeable mental injury, and that this cause of action protects a right to be free from negligent interference with one's mental health. That right is grounded in the simple truth that a person's mental health - like a person's physical integrity or property, injury to which is also compensable in negligence law - is an essential means by which that person chooses to live life and pursue goals (A. Ripstein, Private Wrongs (2016), at pp. 87 and 252-53). And, where mental injury is negligently inflicted, a person's autonomy to make those choices is undeniably impaired, sometimes to an even greater degree than the impairment which follows a serious physical injury (Bourhill v. Young, [1943] A.C. 92 (H.L.), at p. 103; Toronto Railway, at p. 276). To put the point more starkly, ""[t]he loss of our mental health is a more fundamental violation of our sense of self than the loss of a finger"" (Stevens, at p. 55).
[24]
 It is also implicit in Mustapha that the ordinary duty of care analysis is to be applied to claims for negligently caused mental injury. With great respect to courts that have expressed contrary views, it is in my view unnecessary and indeed futile to re-structure that analysis so as to mandate formal, separate consideration of certain dimensions of proximity, as was done in McLoughlin v. O'Brian. Certainly, ""temporal"", ""geographic"" and ""relational"" considerations might well inform the proximity analysis to be performed in some cases. But the proximity analysis as formulated by this Court is, and is intended to be, sufficiently flexible to capture all relevant circumstances that might in any given case go to seeking out the ""close and direct"" relationship which is the hallmark of the common law duty of care (Cooper v. Hobart, 2001 SCC 79, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 537, at para. 32, citing Donoghue v. Stevenson, [1932] A.C. 562 (H.L.), at pp. 580-81). As the Court has said, that analysis
focuses on factors arising from the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant. . . .
. . .
As this Court stated in Hercules Managements Ltd. v. Ernst & Young, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 165, at para. 24, per La Forest J.:
The label ""proximity"", as it was used by Lord Wilberforce in [Anns v. Merton London Borough Council, [1978] A.C. 728 (H.L.)], was clearly intended to connote that the circumstances of the relationship inhering between the plaintiff and the defendant are of such nature that the defendant may be said to be under an obligation to be mindful of the plaintiff's legitimate interests in conducting his or her affairs.
 (Cooper, at paras. 30 and 33 (emphasis in original))

Recognized Psychiatric Illness
[25]
 As I have already said, the principal issue presented by this appeal - and, in particular, by the Court of Appeal's conclusion that the appellant's claim failed for lack of expert evidence demonstrating a recognized psychiatric illness - concerns the element of the cause of action of negligence requiring the claimant to show damage. More specifically, it requires the Court to consider what constitutes mental injury, and how it may be proven.
[26]
 The origins of the putative requirement of showing a recognized psychiatric illness appear to lie in Lord Denning M.R.'s speech in Hinz v. Berry, [1970] 2 Q.B. 40 (C.A.), at p. 42:
In English law no damages are awarded for grief or sorrow caused by a person's death. No damages are to be given for the worry about the children, or for the financial strain or stress, or the difficulties of adjusting to a new life. Damages are, however, recoverable for nervous shock, or, to put it in medical terms, for a recognisable psychiatric illness caused by the breach of duty by the defendant.
This statement has been reiterated, albeit with some variation as to terminology. In McLoughlin v. O'Brian, at p. 431, for example, Lord Bridge described this hurdle as requiring ""a positive psychiatric illness"". It has also been variously referred to as a ""genuine"", ""recognized"" or ""recognizable"" psychiatric illness (Mulheron, at p. 81).
[27]
 Howsoever the term is phrased, it is far from clear on the text of Hinz v. Berry that it was intended to impose upon claimants the burden of showing a positive expert diagnosis. At the very least, it is not obvious that Hinz v. Berry sought to download to expert psychiatric witnesses the trier of fact's task of determining whether the claimant sustained mental injury (Teff, at p. 53; and B langer-Hardy, at pp. 607-11). The respondents' submission, therefore - that, by ""recognizable psychiatric illness"", it was intended that mental injury be ""recognizable"" to a psychiatrically trained expert witness, and not to an ordinary witness - is founded upon a shaky premise. 
[28]
 Despite some early resistance, however (e.g. McDermott v. Ramadanovic Estate (1988), 27 B.C.L.R. (2d) 45 (S.C.); Rhodes, per Southin J.A., concurring; Cox v. Fleming (1995), 15 B.C.L.R. (3d) 201 (C.A.); Mason v. Westside Cemeteries Ltd. (1996), 135 D.L.R. (4th) 361 (Ont. C.J. (Gen. Div.)); Flett v. Maxwell, [1996] B.C.J. No.1455 (QL) (Prov. Ct. (Civ. Div.)), Canadian trial and appellate courts after Hinz v. Berry began to see the requirement of a ""recognizable psychiatric illness"" as conditioning recovery for mental injury upon the claimant adducing expert testimony verifying a condition recognizable to the expert (e.g. Vanek v. Great Atlantic & Pacific Co. of Canada (1999), 48 O.R. (3d) 228 (C.A.), at paras. 65-67; Healey v. Lakeridge Health Corp., 2011 ONCA 55, 103 O.R. (3d) 401; Frazer v. Haukioja, 2010 ONCA 249, 101 O.R. (3d) 528; Kotai v. ""Queen of the North"" (The), 2009 BCSC 1405, 70 C.C.L.T. (3d) 221; Young v. Borzoni, 2007 BCCA 16, 277 D.L.R. (4th) 685; Graham v. MacMillan, 2003 BCCA 90, 15 C.C.L.T. (3d) 155;Koerfer v. Davies, [1994] O.J. No. 1408 (QL) (C.A.); Duwyn v. Kaprielian (1978), 22 O.R. (2d) 736 (C.A.)). Similarly, despite some resistance elsewhere in the Commonwealth to restricting recovery for mental injury to claimants who can adduce such expert psychiatric evidence (N. J. Mullany and P. R. Handford, Tort Liability for Psychiatric Damage (1993), at p. 21), this threshold now prevails in the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand (White, at p. 491; Tame, at paras. 193-94; van Soest v. Residual Health Management Unit, [1999] NZCA 206, [2000] 1 N.Z.L.R. 179, at para. 65). 
[29]
 In sum - and this is the state of the law which this Court must now evaluate - the law developed by Canadian lower courts (albeit, as I have mentioned, on an unstable premise) requires claimants alleging mental injury to show that such injury has manifested itself to an expert in psychiatry in the form of a clinically diagnosed, recognizable psychiatric illness. This has therefore ""place[d] the categories of mental and emotional harm for which damages may be recovered in the hands of psychiatry. Whatever that discipline chooses to identify and name as a psychiatric illness becomes the law's boundaries for damages in this area"" (van Soest, at p. 205, per Thomas J., dissenting).
[30]
 Usually, this has been done with reference to what has been said to represent a ""considerable degree of international agreement on the classification of mental disorders and their diagnostic criteria"", which are contained in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (""DSM""), published by the American Psychiatric Association, and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (""ICD""), published by the World Health Organization (Mulheron, at p. 78, citing Sutherland v. Hatton, [2002] EWCA Civ 76, [2002] 2 All E.R. 1, per Hale L.J. (as she then was); see also B langer-Hardy, at p. 586). The DSM, now in its 5th edition (2013), stipulates diagnostic criteria for, and classifies, mental disorders, while the ICD, now in its 10th revision (1992), contains statistically based classifications of all diseases (including ""mental and behavioural disorders"").
[31]
 Confining compensable mental injury to conditions that are identifiable with reference to these diagnostic tools is, however, inherently suspect as a matter of legal methodology. While, for treatment purposes, an accurate diagnosis is obviously important, a trier of fact adjudicating a claim of mental injury is not concerned with diagnosis, but with symptoms and their effects (Mulheron, at p. 88). Put simply, there is no necessary relationship between reasonably foreseeable mental injury and a diagnostic classification scheme. As Thomas J. observed in van Soest (at para. 100), a negligent defendant need only be shown to have foreseen injury, and not a particular psychiatric illness that comes with its own label. In other words, the trier of fact's inquiry should be directed to the level of harm that the claimant's particular symptoms represent, not to whether a label could be attached to them. Downloading the task of assessing legally recoverable mental injury to the DSM and ICD therefore imports an arbitrary control mechanism upon recovery for mental injury, conditioning recovery not upon any legally principled basis directed to the alleged injury, but upon conformity with a legally irrelevant classification scheme designed to facilitate identification of particular conditions (L. B langer-Hardy, ""Thresholds of Actionable Mental Harm in Negligence: A Policy-Based Analysis"" (2013), 36 Dal. L.J. 103, at pp. 113-15; Mulheron, at pp. 87-88). 
[32]
 Resort to the DSM or ICD in the context of litigating claims for mental injury has been variously rationalized as fostering objectivity, certainty and predictability of outcomes; and as preventing ""indeterminate liability"" (Tame, at paras. 193-94; Healey,at para. 65; Queen of the North, at para. 68). These rationalizations, however, do not withstand scrutiny. In particular, the putative objectivity, certainty and predictability said to be furnished by the recognizable psychological illness requirement are in my view overstated. Psychiatric diagnoses - like diagnoses of physical illness or injury - can sometimes be controversial even among treating practitioners (M. A. Jones, ""Liability for Psychiatric Damage: Searching for a Path between Pragmatism and Principle"", in J. W. Neyers, E. Chamberlain and S. G. A. Pitel, eds., Emerging Issues in Tort Law (2007) 113, at p. 131). The categories identified in the DSM are, therefore, not static, and continue to be revised to reflect evolving psychiatric consensus on the classification of psychiatric disorders. Labels that were at one time widely accepted may become obsolete. The DSM (DSM-II), for example, identified homosexuality as a psychiatric disorder until 1973, after which it continued to identify ""sexual orientation disturbance"" for people ""in conflict with"" their sexual orientation. This was later replaced in the DSM-III with ""ego-dystonic homosexuality"", which was itself removed in 1987 (J. Drescher, ""Out of DSM: Depathologizing Homosexuality"" (2015), 5 Behav. Sci. 565, at p. 571). The ICD retained homosexuality in its classification until 1990, and continues to identify ego-dystonic homosexuality as a recognized condition (although in 2014 the World Health Organization recommended its removal from its 11th revision, now in development) (S. Cochran et al., ""Proposed declassification of disease categories related to sexual orientation in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Health Related Problems (ICD-11)"" (2014), 92 Bull. World Health Organ. 672).
[33]
 Conversely, potential disorders originally excluded from the DSM may be ""legitimized"" by later inclusion. For example, ""post-traumatic stress disorder"" first appeared in the DSM (DSM-III) in 1980. And, with the publication of the DSM-IV, it no longer required ""a psychologically traumatic event that is generally outside the range of usual human experience"" (Jones, at p. 132). Similarly, the release of the 5th edition of the DSM (DSM-V) was preceded by a debate about the inclusion of grief as a psychiatric condition (R. A. Bryant, ""Grief as a psychiatric disorder"" (2012), 201 Br. J. Psychiatry 9, at pp. 9-10). Rather than fostering objectivity, certainty and predictability of outcomes, then, tethering determinations of legal liability to these iterative diagnostic tools relegates the law of negligence to following a sometimes meandering path as it is cleared by the cutting edge of au courant thinking in modern psychiatry - wherever it may lead, or from wherever it may retreat. 
[34]
 The view that a recognizable psychiatric illness requirement is necessary to prevent indeterminate liability, advanced before us by the respondents and the Insurance Bureau of Canada, is similarly untenable. Article 1457 of the Civil Code of Qu bec imposes a liability rule binding defendants ""to make reparation for the injury, whether it be bodily, moral or material in nature"" (see, e.g., Augustus v. Gosset, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 268, at para. 27). And yet, our attention has not been drawn to any instances where Quebec courts imposed liability that was in some way ""indeterminate"". Further, and as I have explained is the case with unmeritorious or trivial claims for negligently caused mental injury, robust application of the elements of the cause of action of negligence should also be sufficient to address concerns for indeterminate liability. In particular, liability for mental injury must be confined to claims which satisfy the proximity analysis within the duty of care framework, which focuses on the relationship between the parties (Cooper, at para. 30), and the remoteness inquiry, which asks whether ""the harm [is] too unrelated to the wrongful conduct to hold the defendant fairly liable"" (Mustapha, at para. 12, quoting Linden and Feldthusen, at p. 360). We have been given no reason to suppose that the same sort of constraints which negligence law imposes upon claimants alleging physical injury would be less effective in weeding out unworthy claims for mental injury. It is therefore not only undesirable, but unnecessary to distort negligence law by applying the mechanism of a diagnostic threshold for proving mental injury.
[35]
 In short, no cogent basis has been offered to this Court for erecting distinct rules which operate to preclude liability in cases of mental injury, but not in cases of physical injury. Indeed, there is good reason to recognize the law of negligence as already according each of these different forms of personal injury - mental and physical - identical treatment. As the Court observed in Mustapha (at para. 8), the distinction between physical and mental injury is ""elusive and arguably artificial in the context of tort"". Continuing (and citing Page v. Smith, at p. 188), the Court explained that, ""[i]n an age when medical knowledge is expanding fast, and psychiatric knowledge with it, it would not be sensible to commit the law to a distinction between physical and psychiatric injury, which may . . . soon be altogether outmoded. Nothing will be gained by treating them as different 'kinds' of personal injury, so as to require the application of different tests in law"" (emphasis in original; see also S. Deakin, A. Johnston and B. Markesinis, Markesinis and Deakin's Tort Law (7th ed. 2013), at p. 124). This is entirely consistent with the Court's longstanding view, expressed over a century ago, by Fitzpatrick C.J. in Toronto Railway, at pp. 269-70:
It would appear somewhat difficult to distinguish between the injury caused to the human frame by the impact and that resulting to the nervous system in consequence of the shock . . . . The nature of the mysterious relation which exists between the nervous system and the passive tissues of the human body has been the subject of much learned speculation, but I am not aware that the extent to which the one acts and reacts upon the other has yet been definitely ascertained. . . . I cannot find the line of demarcation between the damage resulting to the human [body] . . . and that which may flow from the disturbance of the nervous system . . . . The latter may well be the result of a derangement of the relation existing between the bones, the sinews, the arteries and the nerves. In any event the resultant effect is the same. The victim is incapacitated . . . .
Or, as Davies J. (as he then was) added in Toronto Railways (at p. 275), ""[t]he nervous system is just as much a part of man's physical being as the muscular or other parts"". In a similar vein, Lord Macmillan, in Bourhill v. Young (at p. 103), said ""[t]he distinction between mental shock and bodily injury was never a scientific one, for mental shock is presumably in all cases the result of, or at least accompanied by, some physical disturbance in the sufferer's system.""
[36]
 It follows that requiring claimants who allege one form of personal injury (mental) to prove that their condition meets the threshold of ""recognizable psychiatric illness"", while not imposing a corresponding requirement upon claimants alleging another form of personal injury (physical) to show that their condition carries a certain classificatory label, is inconsistent with prior statements of this Court, among others. It accords unequal - that is, less - protection to victims of mental injury. And it does so for no principled reason (Beever, at p. 410). I would not endorse it. 
[37]
 None of this is to suggest that mental injury is always as readily demonstrable as physical injury. While allegations of injury to muscular tissue may sometimes pose challenges to triers of fact, many physical conditions such as lacerations and broken bones are objectively verifiable. Mental injury, however, will often not be as readily apparent. Further, and as Mustapha makes clear, mental injury is not proven by the existence of mere psychological upset. While, therefore, tort law protects persons from negligent interference with their mental health, there is no legally cognizable right to happiness. Claimants must, therefore, show much more - that the disturbance suffered by the claimant is ""serious and prolonged and rise[s] above the ordinary annoyances, anxieties and fears"" that come with living in civil society (Mustapha, at para. 9). To be clear, this does not denote distinct legal treatment of mental injury relative to physical injury; rather, it goes to the prior legal question of what constitutes ""mental injury"". Ultimately, the claimant's task in establishing a mental injury is to show the requisite degree of disturbance (although not, as the respondents say, to show its classification as a recognized psychiatric illness). 
[38]
 Nor should any of this be taken as suggesting that expert evidence cannot assist in determining whether or not a mental injury has been shown. In assessing whether the claimant has succeeded, it will often be important to consider, for example, how seriously the claimant's cognitive functions and participation in daily activities were impaired, the length of such impairment and the nature and effect of any treatment (Mulheron, at p. 109). To the extent that claimants do not adduce relevant expert evidence to assist triers of fact in applying these and any other relevant considerations, they run a risk of being found to have fallen short. As Thomas J. observed in van Soest (at para. 103), ""[c]ourts can be informed by the expert opinion of modern medical knowledge"", ""without needing to address the question whether the mental suffering is a recognisable psychiatric illness or not"". To be clear, however: while relevant expert evidence will often be helpful in determining whether the claimant has proven a mental injury, it is not required as a matter of law. Where a psychiatric diagnosis is unavailable, it remains open to a trier of fact to find on other evidence adduced by the claimant that he or she has proven on a balance of probabilities the occurrence of mental injury. And, of course, it also remains open to the defendant, in rebutting a claim, to call expert evidence establishing that the accident cannot have caused any mental injury, or at least any mental injury known to psychiatry. While, for the reasons I have given, the lack of a diagnosis cannot on its own be dispositive, it is something that the trier of fact can choose to weigh against evidence supporting the existence of a mental injury.

Application 
[39]
 The trial judge found that the accident caused the appellant to suffer ""psychological injuries, including personality change and cognitive difficulties"" (para. 50) such as slowed speech, leading to a deterioration of his close personal relationships with his family and friends. He remarked (at para. 65) that the appellant ""was a changed man with his irritability likely reflecting a dark realization that he was not the man he once was"". These findings have not been challenged. And, as findings of fact, they are entitled to appellate deference, absent palpable and overriding error (Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at para. 10).
[40]
 I see no legal error in the trial judge's treatment of the evidence of the appellant's symptoms as supporting a finding of mental injury. Those symptoms fit well within the Mustapha parameters of mental injury which I have already recounted. While there was no expert testimony associating them with a condition identified in the DSM or ICD, I reiterate that what matters is substance - meaning, those symptoms - and not the label. And, the evidence accepted by the trial judge clearly showed a serious and prolonged disruption that transcended ordinary emotional upset or distress.
IV. 
Conclusion and Disposition
[41]
 I would allow the appeal, with costs in this Court and in the courts below.
[42]
 The respondents seek to have the matter returned to the Court of Appeal for determination of their alternative grounds of appeal before that court - that the trial judge erred in finding that the mental injury caused by the accident was indivisible from any injury arising from the third accident; and that the damage award was excessive. I would, instead, restore the trial judge's award. 
[43]
 The (in)divisibility of two injuries is a question of fact (Bradley, at paras. 32 and 37). Here, the trial judge found that ""the cause of the change to the plaintiff's personality and his cognitive difficulties cannot be divided based on the events before and after September 17, 2005"" (para. 58). That finding, which was open to him to make on this record, is entitled to deference. The respondents now argue that the Workers Compensation Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 492, ""serves to sever the case even in the context of an indivisible injury"", ""because the [Act] creates a complete scheme and bars compensation"" (transcript, at p. 82). This argument, based on an interpretation of s. 10 of the Workers Compensation Act, was made briefly in oral argument at trial (see R.R., vol. I, at pp. 253-54), but did not appear in their written submissions. While this argument appears to have found support in Pinch v. Hofstee, 2015 BCSC 1888, it was not dealt with by the trial judge in this case. For whatever reason, the respondents did not raise it at the Court of Appeal or in their factum filed at this Court. It was revived only in their oral submissions before us. Without endorsing or rejecting the reasoning in Pinch, I observe that, without full submissions and a pertinent lower court record, this is not an appropriate circumstance to decide the effect of workers' compensation legislation on the divisibility of injuries.
[44]
 As to the quantum of the award, I note that both accidents at the root of this appeal occurred nearly 12 years ago, and that the litigation - in which the respondents have admitted liability - is now (as of this month) fully 10 years old. Further, the modest award in this case is not out of step with non-pecuniary damage awards from British Columbia courts for injuries causing personality changes and cognitive difficulties with similar consequences upon the plaintiff's enjoyment of life (e.g. Zawadzki v. Calimoso, 2011 BCSC 45). 
[45]
 The Court's power to remand to a court of appeal is discretionary (Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. S-26, s. 46.1; Wells v. Newfoundland, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 199, at para. 68). The passage of time since the acknowledged wrong against Mr. Saadati and the commencement of these proceedings militates against remand. As in Wells, the damages assessed by the trial judge are reasonable, supported by the record, and fairly compensate the appellant's loss. I conclude, therefore, that it would not ""be just in the circumstances"" (s. 46.1) to remand this matter to the Court of Appeal.

Plaintiffs have brought this action at law primarily against defendant No.2-Natonal Tariff Commission (""NTC"") that while conducting an investigation in respect of product Continuous Casting Billets (""C.C. Billets"") imported by the plaintiffs, the defendant No.2-NTC is not acting within parameters of law. Plaint contains the following prayer clause:--
""PRAYERS
 The Plaintiffs herein above mentioned humbly pray for the following:--
 1. The Honourable High Court may be pleased to declare that the investigation initiated by the Defendant No.2 is unlawful and illegal, and hence of no legal effect;
 2. The Honourable High Court may be pleased to declare that the Defendant No.2 had acted unlawfully and illegally in depriving the Plaintiffs of the complete copy of the application, along with all annexures and evidence, on the basis of alleged confidentiality;
 3. That the Honourable High Court may be pleased to restrain the Defendants from initiating, conducting or concluding the impugned investigation (as mentioned in Public Notice dated 05.08.2015) against the producers / importers of hot rolled steel billets;
 4. That in the alternative, the Honourable High Court may be pleased to restrain the Defendants from conducting and / or concluding the investigation without affording the Plaintiffs a copy of the application submitted by the applicants to Defendant No.2, inclusive of all evidence attached therewith, an opportunity to be heard, as well as all other legal rights as available under the law;
 5. That the Honourable High Court may be pleased to award the costs of the suit to the plaintiffs;
 6. That the Honourable High Court may be pleased to award any other relief as it may deem appropriate in the facts and circumstances of the instant case.""
2.
 On issuance of notice, defendant No.2-NTC has contentiously contested the case and claim of plaintiffs by filing their counter affidavits to different interlocutory applications filed by the plaintiff, to which the latter filed Affidavit-in-Rejoinder.
3.
 Since the controversy at hand does not involve such facts, which are triable issues, therefore, by consent of the parties, it was decided that this matter should be decided on the basis of legal issues, therefore, vide order dated 16.01.2017, following consent issues were settled:--
 1. Whether the suit as framed and filed is maintainable in law?
 2. Whether the requirement of Sections 31 and 33 of Anti-Dumping Duties Act, 2015, has been complied with or not?
4.
 While writing Judgment, it is deemed appropriate that though a formal but a necessary issue should also be framed to the effect that:
 3. What should the decree be?
5.
 Succinctly, Plaintiffs are engaged in the business of importing ""hot rolled steel billets"" (raw material), for the purpose of manufacturing steel bars through a metal working process.
6.
 As per learned counsel, a Complaint has been lodged with the Defendant No. 2 against the Plaintiffs that the latter have committed an act of dumping the above product in local market, that is, introduced into the Commerce of Pakistan. Subsequently, a Public Notice dated 05.10.2015 was published in the Daily Express ""Tribune"" by the Defendant No.2 under Anti-Dumping Duties Act, 2015, (""Governing Law""). The investigation is in respect of C.C. Billets exported by China into Pakistan. Hence, the above C.C. Billets are the investigated product in term of Section 2(k) of the Governing Law.
7.
 In the intervening period, defendant No.2-NTC has given its Preliminary Determination about the subject product. This report dated 22.04.2016, has been appended as Annexure ""A"" with C.M.A.No.15958 of 2016, preferred by the plaintiff and seeking a restraining order against defendant No.2-NTC from passing a final determination in the matter. In addition to this, another application being C.M.A.No.15780 of 2016 was filed for initiating contempt proceedings against officials of defendant No.2-NTC.
8.
 The grievance of the Plaintiffs is that the Defendant No.2 has not provided them a complete copy of the complaint lodged by (i) A mreli Steels Limited, Karachi (ii) Agha Steel Industries, Karachi, and (iii) ASG Metals Limited, Karachi, (Complainants/Interested Parties). Subsequently, Amreli Steels Limited was impleaded as defendant No.3, vide order dated 08.02.2017.
9.
 Mr. Haider Waheed, learned counsel vehemently argued that it is plaintiffs' statutory right in terms of Section 28 and Section 33 of the Governing Law to be provided the full text of written application along with record/material relied upon by the above Applicants / Complainants and the Plaintiffs have under the latter provision has a right to see the information relating to the subject Complaint. It was further argued that only fetter to the above provision is Section 31, which pertains to the confidentiality, but in Section 31 itself the confidentiality is qualified (conditional) and has been explained in detail; that includes business or trade secrets, production process and other operational and financial information, which are not publicly available. To justify his submissions, the plaintiffs' counsel has drawn the attention of the Court to certain portion of the Complaint in which normal export price and other components are missing, rather they are deleted through asterisk and at page 543 of the case file it has been alleged that the goods imported by plaintiffs have a dumping margin of 46.86% which plaintiffs' side seriously questions besides impugning the entire proceedings. It would be advantageous to reproduce Section 31 herein under:--
 ""31. Confidentiality.-(1) Subject to subsection (2), the Commission shall, during and after an investigation, keep confidential any information submitted to it and such information shall not be disclosed without specific permission of the party submitting it.
(2)

 Provided as confidential by parties to an investigation, shall, on good cause shown, be kept confidential by the Commission.
(3)
 The following types of information shall be deemed to be by nature confidential, unless the Commission determines that disclosure in a particular case would neither be of significant competitive advantage to a competitor nor have a significantly adverse effect upon a person supplying the information or upon a person from whom such information was acquired, namely: --
(a)
 business or trade secrets concerning the nature of a product, production processes, operations, production equipment, or machinery;
(b)
 Information concerning financial condition of a company which is not publicly available; and
(c)
 information concerning costs, identification of customers, sales, inventories, shipments, or amount or source of any income, profit, loss or expenditure related to manufacture and sale of a product.
(4)
 Any party seeking any information to be kept confidential shall request for the same at the time the information is submitted, along with the reasons warranting confidentiality. The Commission shall consider such request expedite ously keeping the information confidential is not warranted.
(5)
 Any party submitting any information with the request to keep it confidential shall furnish non-confidential summary of all such information. Such summary may take the form of ranges or indexation of figures provided in the confidential version or marked deletions in text or in such other form as the Commission may require:
 Provided that such non-confidential summary shall permit a reasonable understanding of the substance of the information submitted in confidence:
 Provided further that any deletion in text shall, unless otherwise allowed by the Commission, only relate to names of the buyer or supplier.
(6)
 In exceptional circumstances, any party submitting confidential information may indicate that such information is not susceptible of summary, in which case a statement of the reasons why summarization is not possible shall be provided. If the Commissioner concludes that the non-confidential summary provided fails to satisfy the requirements of subsection (5), it may determine that the request for keeping the information confidential is not warranted.
(7)
 If the Commission finds that a request for keeping the information confidential is not warranted, and if the supplier of such information is unwilling to make it public or to authorize the disclosure in generalized or summary form, the Commission shall disregard such information and return the same to the party submitting it.
(8)
 Subject to subsection (9), notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or in any other law for the time being in force, any confidential information received or obtained, directly or indirectly, by the Commissioner pursuant to or in connection with an investigation shall not be subject to disclosure by the Commission Government or a Provincial Government without the prior permission of the party submitting such confidential information.
(9)
 The provisions of subsection (8) shall not preclude the supply of any information called for by the Appellate Tribunal pursuant to section 72:
 Provided that the obligation to protect confidential information as provided for in this Chapter shall, mutatis mutandis, extend to the Appellate Tribunal.""
10.
 It was further argued that the defendant No.2 in utter disregard of other statutory provision has accepted the subject Complaint for hearing. To explain this contention, the learned counsel has made a Reference to Sections 20, 21, 22 and Subsection 2 (b) of Section 20, inter alia, providing that the application / complaint should disclose the evidence of dumping and injury; similarly Section 21 enjoins that a notice to be given to the Government of each exporting country; in the present case China, whereas, Section 23 provides that defendant No.2/Commission should first examine the accuracy and adequacy of the evidence and where after, the application / complaint shall be set down for a proper investigation.
11.
 The Plaintiffs' side further contends that the Complainants in the present case do not even fulfill the criteria mentioned in Section 24 of the Governing Law, primarily relating to the production capacity. To further fortify this argument, plaintiffs' legal team has relied upon the language of subsection (2) of Section 24, which is in a negative command, which according to him, should be interpreted strictly being mandatory in nature. Further arguments from the plaintiffs' side were advanced to show that in view of the above provision, the defendant No.2 has to pass a preliminary order about the competency of the Applicants / Complaints before initiating the subject investigation against the plaintiffs. As per learned counsel for the Plaintiffs, the present Complainants /Applicants neither constitute 25% (twenty five percent) of the total production of market share nor fulfills the 50% threshold of collective output, hence their complaint before defendant No.2-NTC is liable to be dismissed. In this regard he has referred to public advertisement appended as Annexure ""A"" with the Plaintiffs' Rejoinder, in which it is mentioned that the total production capacity of Still Mills Manufactures in Pakistan is seven million Metric Ton and due to certain Government policies they were compelled to reduce their production to only fifty percent. As per learned counsel if the interview of CEO of one of the Complainants (interested party) Amreli Steels Limited (defendant No.3) is read, which he has annexed with his Affidavit-in-Rejoinder, if would be clear that total capacity of Amreli Steels Limited is two lac metric ton only and if the other Complainants, for the arguments sake are also joined with Amreli Steels Limited then the accumulative total production would be six lac metric ton. Plaintiffs' counsel has referred to its covering letter of 15.09.2015, under which they have filed their Reply / Comments before defendant No.2-NTC in response to the investigation under dispute bearing Case No.36 of 2015/NTC/CCB. This covering letter and Reply are appended with Affidavit-in-Rejoinder of plaintiffs, which they have filed as rebuttal to the counter affidavit of defendants to C.M.A.No.12609 of 2015, whereunder plaintiffs have sought an interim injunctive relief.
12.
 Primarily, the plaintiffs' side laid foundation of their arguments on section 31 of the Governing Law. The crux of the arguments is that unless defendant No.2-NTC meets the test of Section 31 (confidentiality) of the Governing Law, latter (defendant No.2-NTC) is under an obligation to provide the entire complaint along with annexures to the plaintiffs enabling them to file a comprehensive reply. The onus is on defendant No.2-NTC to show ""good cause"" for not disclosing the contents of entire complaint, which onus defendants have failed to discharge. It was further argued that the Questionnaire, which is annexed as Annexure 'F/1' at page-489, contains indexation and other asterisk and the actual figures as contained in the complaint of above named complainants including defendant No.3 has not been disclosed by defendant No.2-NTC to the plaintiffs and thus the latter deprived of their right to a fair trial as envisaged under Article 10A read with Article 19A, relating to freedom of information, of the Constitution of Pakistan.
13.
 In his rebuttal by filing a comprehensive synopsis, the plaintiffs' counsel has reiterated that even information within public domain has also been withheld in the questionnaire, which created impediment for the plaintiffs to submit their complete reply and that is why they have submitted their incomplete response as referred hereinabove.
 As per plaintiffs, defendant No.2-NTC has given the details of Chinese Exporters and the quantity they have exported, but yet Commission did not have exporting price, which is not believable and can easily be obtained from the Chinese Market by defendant No.2-NTC as well as through other material available, for instance, London Metal Bulletin and the Chinese Metal Bulletin. Similarly, pivotal factor in determining the injury is the calculation of normal value of the investigated product. As per the plaintiffs' counsel, normal value indexed by defendant No.2-NTC in its questionnaire in Table-2 under clause 8.6, (available at page-539 of the case file), is completely erroneous and imaginary as normal value can be calculated or determined by applying standard methods including the one mentioned hereinabove. Consequently, the plaintiffs have challenged the dumping margin of 46.86% as mentioned under clause-9 of the questionnaire -Table-3. Plaintiffs' counsel has cited the Judgments mentioned in the title of this decision to fortify his submissions.
14.
 The above arguments were controverted by the legal team of defendants Nos.1 and 2; Mr. Ali Almani and Mr. Ahmed Shiraz (Legal Advisor of NTC). According to defendants' counsel, while conducting investigation against the plaintiffs, defendant No.2-NTC has complied with requisite statutory formalities and the entire investigation up to the stage of Preliminary Determination is carried out and completed through due process of law.
15.
 As per defendants' counsel, defendant No.2-NTC had first made efforts to obtain information and other data about the subject dispute from Chinese Exporters through Chinese Embassy at Islamabad, besides, sending a questionnaire to Pakistani importers including the plaintiffs. Unfortunately, no information was shared by Chinese Exporters and even conduct of Pakistani Importers is also not forthcoming, except those which are mentioned in paragraph-15-3 of the Preliminary Determination. It is further argued that the Governing Law itself is quite equitable in nature and unlike other statutes, in terms of Section 70 thereof, even an investigation of the nature is also appealable before the Appellate Tribunal, thus, the plaintiffs have every right to agitate their grievances before the Appellate Tribunal established under the 
Governing Law, which is a special statute, instead of pursuing the present lis, which otherwise tantamount to strangulating the statutory 
provisions of the Governing Law as this Court is a final Court of Appeal against the decisions of the Appellate Tribunal in terms of subsection (13) of Section 70 of the Governing Law.
 It was further argued by defendants' legal team that investigation is only undertaken if it appears to defendant No.2-NTC that act of dumping is causing injury to the local industry. Mr. Ali Almani has referred to the Binder No.A and read the internationally accepted concept of dumping. He then referred to relevant Articles of the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, besides citing case-law of foreign jurisdictions in support of his stance that confidentiality clause is not something unusual in the Governing Law, but similar clauses do exist in the laws of all those countries, where the Anti-Dumping Regime are functioning. It would be advantageous to reproduce the relevant concept on 'dumping' as under:--
 ""The term ""Dumping"" is recognized as a practice of selling a product in a foreign country for less than the prevailing price of the same product in the domestic country or the manufacturing cost of the product. Many countries have declared dumping as an illegal business practice to protect their domestic industries from such unfair competition. If a company situated in a country exports a product at an export price lower than the normal price it charges in its domestic market, it is said to be ""dumping"" the product into another Country. This form of price differentiation between markets is not a prohibited practice under international trade agreements.
 The only unacceptable and harmful type of dumping is predatory dumping, which happens when a foreign firm, with the help of huge subsidies from its Government, sells goods at lower prices or below cost of manufacturing in the domestic market of the importing country in order to eliminate domestic producers and gain monopoly. It can harm the domestic industry by reducing its sales volume in market shares, as well as its sales prices, resulting in decline in profitability, job losses and, in the worst case, in the domestic industry going out of business and thus creating monopolistic situations. Such dumping, where the dumping firm rules the price on attaining monopoly is harmful 
to the entire society because it hurts not only the domestic producers but also consumers. Such business practice is clearly undesirable as viewed by a huge number of free trade opponents.
 According to the World Trade Organization (WTO) Rules, a firm is said to dump if it sells its product in another country at a price less than the normal value.
 Remedial action in the form of Anti-Dumping measures generally involves charging extra import duty on that product from the exporting country to bring its closure to the normal value and thus remove the injury to the domestic industry in the importing country.""
 Similarly, Section 4 of the Governing Law provides_
 4. Identification of dumping.---For the purposes of this Act an investigated product shall be considered to be dumped if it is introduced into the commerce of Pakistan at a price which is less than its normal value.
16.
 It is also necessary to reproduce the relevant Articles hereunder of the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 to which Pakistan is one of the signatories and the reason for enacting the Governing Law:
 ""Members hereby agree as follows:
PART 1
Article 1
Principles
 An anti-dumping measure shall be applied only under the circumstances provided for in Article VI of GATT, 1994 and pursuant to investigations initiated and conducted in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. The following provisions govern the application of Article VI of GATT, 1994 in so far as action is taken under anti-dumping legislation or regulations.
 2.1 For the purpose of this Agreement, a product is to be considered as being dumped, i.e. introduced into the commerce of another country at less than its normal value, if the export price of the product exported from one country to another is less than the comparable price, in the ordinary course of trade, for the like product when destined for consumption in the exporting country.
 6.5 Any information which is by nature confidential (for example, because its disclosure would be of significant competitive advantage to a competitor or because its disclosure would have a significantly adverse effect upon a person supplying the information or upon a person from whom that person acquired the information), or which is provided on a confidential basis by parties to an investigation shall, upon good cause shown, be treated as such by the authorities. Such information shall not be disclosed without specific permission of the party submitting it. 
 6.5.1 The authorities shall require interested parties providing confidential information to furnish non-confidential summaries thereof. These summaries shall be in sufficient detail to permit a reasonable understanding of the substance of the information submitted in confidence. In exceptional circumstances, such parties may indicate that such information is not susceptible of summary. In such exceptional circumstances, a statement of the reasons why summarization is not possible must be provided. 
 6.5.2 If the authorities find that a request for confidentiality is not warranted and if the supplier of the information is either unwilling to make the information public or to authorize its disclosure in generalized or summary form, the authorities may disregard such information unless it can be demonstrated to their satisfaction from appropriate sources that the information is correct.""
17.
 Defendants' counsel has also relied upon number of reported decisions (Supra) in support of his arguments that rule of adequate and efficacious alternate remedy in statutory hierarchy as is mentioned in the Governing Law, is not only applicable to the exercise of writ jurisdiction but also to the proceedings of the nature, though here it is termed as rule of implied ouster.
18.
 With regard to the arguments of the plaintiffs' side that the Complainants including defendant No.3 do not constitute 50% of market share, it was stated that this aspect was specifically dealt with while passing the Preliminary Determination by defendant No.2-NTC; Paragraphs Nos. 8 to 9.5 of Preliminary Determination were referred by defendants' side in relation to the market shares of the complainant, besides making a reference to page-517 of main file, which is one of the sections of the impugned Questionnaire dealing with the issue of market share under Section 24 (of the Governing Law).
19.
 Mr. Khalid Jawed Khan, learned counsel for defendant No.3 based his arguments on various statutory provisions of the Governing Law. He referred to Section 25 to advance his contention that defendant No.2-NTC can even Suo Moto take notice of dumping of goods in Pakistan, which is causing injury to local industry and, therefore, plea taken by the plaintiffs about inadequacy of requisite market shares of the Complainant is meritless. He further contended that Anti-Dumping Duty is only leviable when the act of Anti-Dumping is causing injury to the Complainants or local industry in terms of Section 3 of the Governing Law. It was further averred that the Governing Law itself provides checks and balances on defendant No.2-NTC and the onus is on latter to prove the material injury cause to the local industry. It was further argued that if every investigation, which otherwise is initiated after preliminary enquiry, is restrained, then defendant No.2-NTC would become dysfunctional. Learned counsel representing defendant No.3, while summing up his arguments has relied upon the judgment of SECP v. Mian Nisar Elahi (supra), that time can be enlarged by this Court, which will enable the plaintiffs to file their appeal before the Appellate Tribunal in terms of Section 70 of the Governing Law, if in the event, this Court comes to the conclusion that present suit is not maintainable.
20.
 With the able assistance of learned counsel representing respective parties, the record of the case is examined and their submissions are thoughtfully considered.
21.
 In compliance of the observations, Mr. Ahmed Shiraz (Legal Advisor) of defendant No.2-NTC has submitted an additional Information in the form of a Binder, in which record and proceedings of the impugned complaint, which is pending before the said defendant No.2-NTC, has been made available, besides, extract of relevant provisions/Articles of the GATT, 1994 and one of the precedents in which Egyptian Authority; viz. 'Anti-Dumping, Subsidy and Safeguard Department' sought information from Pakistan as an exporting country of the product Matches (in Boxes). The above questionnaire of Egyptian Jurisdiction is a non-confidential version in which crucial information has either been indexed or left blank.
22.
 Anti-Dumping Duties Rules, 2001, have been referred and particularly sub-rules d, e, f, g of Rule 3, to support their contention that defendant No.2-NTC sought all that information from the interested parties / complainants, which was required to evaluate the accuracy of complaint. It was further argued that at National Tariff Commission, transparency is maintained by maintaining a public file relating to each investigation containing information, but obviously not the confidential one covered under Section 31 of the Governing Law; in this regard Rules 3 and 7 of the Anti-Dumping Rules, 2001, are referred. It would be advantageous to reproduce the above discussed Rules:
 ""3. Disclosure in application.---An application shall, in addition to the information specified in section 20 of the Ordinance, contain such information as is reasonably available to an applicant on the following, namely:--
 (a) Name, address, telephone number, facsimile number and electronic mail address of the applicant;
 (b) the identity of domestic industry by or on behalf of which the application is being made, including the names, addresses and telephone numbers, facsimile numbers and electronic mail addresses of all other known producers or, association of producers which is a trade organisation as defined in the Trade Organisations Ordinance, 1961 (XLV of 1961), and has been granted or deemed to have been granted a licence thereunder, in domestic industry;
 (c) Information relating to the degree of domestic industry support for the application, including--
 (i) The total volume and value of domestic production of a domestic like product; and
 (ii) The volume and value of a domestic like product produced by the applicant and by each domestic producer identified;
 (d) a complete description of the allegedly dumped product, including the technical characteristics and uses of such product and its current customs tariff classification number as specified in the First Schedule to the Customs Act, 1969 (IV of 1969);
 (e) the country in which the allegedly dumped product is manufactured or produced and, if it is imported from a country other than the country of manufacture or production, the intermediate country from which the product is imported;
 (f) The name and address of each person the applicant believes sells the allegedly dumped product and the proportion of total exports to Pakistan that person accounted for daring the most recent twelve-month period;
 (g) information on prices at which the product in question iv sold when destined for consumption in domestic market of the country of export or origin or, where appropriate, information on the prices at which the product is sold from the country of export or origin to a third country or on the constructed value of the allegedly dumped product, and information on export prices or, where appropriate, on the prices at which the allegedly dumped product is first resold to an independent buyer in Pakistan, and on any adjustments as provided for in section 11 of the Ordinance.
 7. Public file to be maintained for interested party and access thereto.---(1) The Commission shall establish and maintain a public file relating to each investigation or review pursuant to the Ordinance and subject to the requirement to protect confidential information under section 31 of the Ordinance, the Commission shall place in such file-
 (a) All public notices relating to an investigation or review;
 (b) All materials, including questionnaires, responses to questionnaires, and written communications submitted to the Commission;
 (c) All other information developed or obtained by the Commission; and
 (d) Any other documents the Commission deems appropriate for disclosure to an interested party.
 (2) The public file to be maintained under sub-rule (I) shall be available to any interested party for review and copying at the offices of the Commission, during such time as the Commission may notify, throughout the course of an investigation or review and any appeal under section 64 of the Ordinance.""
23.
 The preamble of the Governing Law itself conveys the object of its enactment, inter alia, in order to implement the international obligation of Pakistan being one of the signatories of General Agreement on Tariff and Trade, 1994 (""GATT""). To give effect to this multilateral treaty, a legislative instrument is required under Article 70, sub-article (2) read with item/paragraph No.3 of Fourth Schedule of Federal Legislative List of the Constitution of Pakistan.
24.
 It is also noteworthy that the Governing Law is quite flexible; Section 46 whereof provides a concept of price undertaking, that is, if the National Tariff Commission in its Preliminary Determination has come to a conclusion that the investigated product has in fact caused the injurious effect of dumping then on the undertaking of exporters that they will not export the product at the dumped price, the imposition of anti-dumping duty can either be suspended or terminated. This shows the inbuilt checks and balances in the Governing Law and apparently these options and discretions are provided to make this statute a practical and workable one as far as possible.
Issue No.2 should be decided first.
25.
 To answer this issue, the impugned Anti-Dumping Importer's Questionnaire with regard to the Product Under Investigation-POI (available at pages-489 to 649) has been perused together with the Report (of 22.04.2016) on Preliminary Determination, available in second part from pages-157 to 225, delivered by the Chairman and the Members of defendant No.2-NTC.
26.
 The questionnaire contain list of exporters but since they all are based in China and did not provide information, therefore, no data was prepared in this regard, but to determine the export price and normal value in terms of sections 5 and 6 of the Governing Law, which is a basic component for reaching the dumping figure causing injury, the defendant No.2-NTC has used indexation. This is a main bone of contention of plaintiff that the defendant No.2-NTC should have disclosed the actual figure provided by interest parties including defendant No.3 (Amreli Steel Limited). It is strenuously argued by legal team of the plaintiffs that the crucial paragraph of questionnaire, where information provided by interested parties / complainants, should have been disclosed, but defendant No.2-NTC has inserted asterisk, due to which the plaintiffs are unable to have a reasonable understanding of questionnaire and sent an abridged version of Reply as referred in the foregoing paragraphs.
27.
 On the other hand learned counsel representing defendant No.2-NTC and defendant No.3 have argued that above being a vital information is fully covered under section 31 of the Governing Law relating to the confidentiality. It was further argued that disclosure of all the information as provided by interested parties/complainants would totally expose complainants' confidential data to the plaintiffs, which admittedly are their competitors.
28.
 Interestingly, the above questionnaire has been sent under a correspondence dated 07.08.2015 by defendant No.2-NTC to one of the plaintiffs, [available at page-485 of the case file], in which the present plaintiffs have also been given an option to provide the answer to the questionnaire in confidential and non-confidential version in the light of Article 6.5.1 of the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of GATT, 1994, (already reproduced hereinabove); it means that plaintiffs have also been given an equal opportunity for not disclosing that information which falls within section 31 of the Governing 
Law.
29.
 Arguments of plaintiffs' counsel that the indexation and asterisks used in the questionnaire is even contrary to the concept of indexation and ranges are wrongly applied merely to technically oust the plaintiffs from the contest and to deprive the plaintiffs from rebutting the evidence of interested parties/complainants, could not be accepted for the reason that Section 31 of the Governing Law itself gives protection to the confidential information which provision is in line with the Clauses / Articles of the afore referred Implementation Agreement. The other argument of Mr. Haider Waheed, that first the defendant No.2-NTC should make a determination and show a 'good cause' as mentioned in subsection 2(b) and (c) of Section 31 of the Governing Law and then can use indexation in the questionnaire, is also devoid of merits, as already in the Governing Law different stages of the proceeding have been mentioned and it is not necessary for defendant No.2-NTC to first pass an independent decision or determination, as argued by plaintiffs' side, before delivering its Preliminary Determination. At best, defendant No.2-NTC can forward its determination that was given to an interested 
party invoking the confidentiality under subsection (4) of Section 31 of the Governing Law, at the time of filing the complaint, also to Respondents, in the present case, the plaintiffs. This aspect of confidentiality has already been determined as pointed out by Mr. Ali Almani (counsel for defendants) in paragraph-18 of the Report on Preliminary Determination dated 22.04.2016 (""Preliminary Determination""), 
therefore, I answer the second issue in the terms that while sending the afore referred questionnaire to the plaintiffs, defendant No.2-NTC has complied with the requirement of Section 31 of the Governing Law, whereas the plaintiffs are entitled to see and obtain copies of that information submitted to defendant No.2-NTC by the complainants/interested parties, which is not confidential and is relevant to the presentation of the case of the plaintiffs as envisaged under section 33 of the Governing Law, which information is accessible by virtue of the aforereferred correspondence of defendant No.2-NTC dated 25.08.2015.
 Plaintiffs' side has relied upon a decision of World Trade Organization (WTO) Appellate Body, on a complaint preferred by Japan, European Union and other countries against the measures adopted by Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China (MOFCOM) imposing Anti-Dumping duties on the products exported from Japan and European Union, was set aside on various grounds including the one mentioned in paragraph-6.1 that China acted inconsistently with Article 6.5 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and permitted the full text of the reports contained in appendix 5 and appendix 8 to the petition, as well as MOFCOM improperly relied on the Market share of dumped imports, and its flawed price report. This decision in my humble view does neither advance the case of plaintiffs nor answers the issues involved in the present proceeding.
 Now adverting to Issue No.1. 
30.
 The unreported decisions relied upon by the plaintiffs' side are taken into account. Two of these are relevant for discussion. The Judgment of learned Lahore High Court given in Writ Petition No.4735 of 2016, which is appended as annexure ""W/2"" with the Written Arguments of Plaintiffs and the other one is a Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court (annexure ""W/4"") handed down in number of Civil Petitions Nos. 1654, 1686, 1607 and others of 2009 filed by Messrs Waheed Sons Lahore and others versus defendant No.2-NTC, in which amongst other, the initiation of investigation on the complaint by one of the local manufacturers, Master Tiles and Ceramic Limited, was challenged. The facts are that while the parties were entangled in litigation, the National Tariff Commission first passed the Preliminary Determination, which was followed by Final Determination. In that case also the product under investigation, viz. porcelain/ceramic tiles, was being imported from China. Though the Hon'ble Apex Court set aside the decision of National Tariff Commission on the ground that composition of National Tariff Commission (present defendant No.2), as mentioned in the relevant Statute-National Tariff Commission Act, 1990 was incomplete, but the cases were remanded to present defendant No.2-NTC for decision afresh in terms of Section 11 of the above Act, while holding that a fresh decision should be given by a duly constituted Commission (NTC). However, the merits of the case were not touched upon and it was left to the Commission to decide the matter on merits. The Lahore High Court's case is not different, in which though it was held that one of the members of the Commission was not qualified to hold the Office while highlighting the importance of the NTC as an institution, but despite this irregularity, the proceeding before the Commission was not quashed but it was held in abeyance with the directions that when the composition of NTC is complete, the proceeding should be resumed. In the operative part of the Order, the learned High Court has specifically clarified that notice of initiation of proceeding which at that time was already issued, will remain intact. 
31.
 Mr. Haider Waheed, learned counsel for the plaintiffs has contended that the Preliminary Determination should be set at naught as it has been passed in violation of restraining order of this Court, which was merged in the order of 10.01.2017 and officials of defendant No.2-NTC has committed contempt of Court. Submission considered. The first ad-interim injunction granted on 22.09.2015 is somewhat conditional and subject to fulfillment of Section 33 of the Governing Law, whereas, on 22.12.2015, the restraining order was slightly modified and on 01.01.2016 the matter was adjourned with a clarification that the defendants while proceeding further in the subject investigation under dispute have to conduct themselves strictly in accordance with law. Regarding the order dated 22.12.2015, the plaintiffs filed a Review Application (C.M.A. No.18691 of 2015), contents whereof are self-explanatory. Finally, on 10.01.2017, the restraining order was lastly modified by directing the Defendants to adhere to the terms of earlier orders of 22.09.2015 and 01.01.2016.
32.
 The relevant provision of the Anti-Dumping Duties Act, 2015 (Governing Law), is also taken into account and in my considered view that under Section 68 thereof, inter alia, (relating to quorum of NTC) a Preliminary Determination of the nature can be decided by two members of defendant No.2-NTC. Admittedly, the subject Report on Preliminary Determination (as referred above) has been signed by the Chairman and one Member, therefore, the same at least on the touchstone of quorum cannot be set at naught. The concluding Paragraph of this Preliminary Determination has clearly stated that no provisional Anti-Dumping Duty has been imposed on plaintiffs in view of the fact that the restraining orders passed by the Court have restrained the defendant No.2-NTC from taking any coercive measure, thus the defendant No.2-NTC refrained itself from imposing any provisional Anti-Dumping Duties on imports of the investigated products. Defendant No.2-NTC informed the counsel for the plaintiffs about Preliminary Determination vide a correspondence dated 26.05.2016 (available at Page-263 of second part of the Court file), but till date, admittedly no appeal (even under protest and without prejudice to the stance in the instant suit) as provided in section 70 of the Governing Law, has been preferred by the plaintiffs to challenge the above Preliminary Determination. Plaintiffs again sought an injunctive relief by filing another Application being C.M.A. No. 15958 of 2016 (under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2 of C.P.C.), inter alia, that defendant No.2-NTC should be restrained from passing a Final Determination, besides filing yet another application for initiating the contempt proceedings against the officials of defendant No.2-NTC.
33.
 Taking into the consideration, the above undisputed factual aspect of the case revolving around the subject Preliminary Determination and peculiar nature of the controversy as agitated in the present cause vis- -vis the Governing Law, having intricate technical characteristics, I am of the considered view that neither defendant No.2-NTC nor its officials, who have been named in the Contempt of Court Application are guilty of disobeying the order of this Court in a contumacious manner, therefore, no proceeding under Contempt of Court Act are warranted against the officials of defendant No.2-NTC and consequently, the C.M.A. No.15780 of 2016 for initiating the contempt proceeding is hereby dismissed. Thus, the Preliminary Determination cannot be set aside at this stage.
34.
 The legal team of defendants has relied upon the number of precedents, which are already mentioned in the title of this decision to advance their arguments on the principle of implied ouster; simply put, what defendants have argued that when a statutory remedy is mentioned in the statute, particularly a special statute governing the subject, then the ordinary jurisdiction of Civil Court under Section 9 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908, is also barred. On this point of law, the afore referred decision of Administrator, Thal Development (supra) handed down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, has been rightly relied upon by the defendants, wherein it has been held that since remedy of appeal was provided under Section 161 of West Pakistan Land Revenue Act, 1967, therefore, mere concession of the parties could not have conferred jurisdiction on a Court which was otherwise expressly barred by a statute and for which a specific mechanism has been provided in the hierarchy of the authority functioning under a special statute. This principle has been expounded in detail in a full bench decision of Mian Sultan (supra) (PLD 1949 Lahore 301), relevant portion whereof is reproduced hereunder for a better appreciation of this rule:
 ""..... It is, not contended here that there is any express ouster of the Civil Court's jurisdiction because neither in the Constitution Act nor in the Orders in Council or the Electoral Rules is there any provision that Civil Courts will have no jurisdiction to entertain suits relating to an electoral right. The question falling for decision is whether on a true construction of the various provisions contained in the Orders in Council and the Electoral Rules it can be held that the jurisdiction of Civil Courts is impliedly barred. It is while determining this question that the distinction between a right which is purely the creation of a statutes and a right at common law becomes important because where a civil right did not exist before a statute was passed and was entirely created by that statute, it is reasonable to infer that the Legislature intended that right to be enforced only in the manner that the statute prescribes. In the present case the right was created by the Constitution Act and the Orders in Council issued thereunder, which, together with the Electoral Rules promulgated by the Governor in exercise of the authority conferred on him by the Act and the Orders, also contain a complete Code in regard to the manner in which a person may acquire and exercise that right and the remedies available to him in case of infringement of that right. The right, therefore, falls within that class of rights which being a creation of the statute can only be enforced in the manner prescribed by the statute creating them and are excluded from the cognizance of Civil Courts. It is this position which was intended to be expressed by the provisions of Part III of the Provincial Elections (Corrupt Practices and Election Petitions) Order to the effect that an election shall not be called in question except by an election petition, that all proceedings and applications in connection with such petition shall be dealt with by and carried on by or before the Commissioners and that the Governor's orders on the report of the Commissioners shall be final. The ouster of Civil Courts' jurisdiction in such cases rests on the construction of the statute creating the right and a special tribunal for its enforcement and if as a matter of construction of the relevant statute the Court arrives at the conclusion that the Legislature intended that the right created by the statute should only be exercised or enforced in the manner provided by that statute, then it is somewhat difficult to accept the Madras and Patna view which found favour with the Division Bench in Sat Narian Gurwala v. Hanuman Parshad (44) that if the special tribunal is not constituted or having been constituted it does not function, the Civil Courts' jurisdiction to adjudicate on that right is not affected. The new right depending for its creation on the will of the Legislature, the Legislature could well have refused to create it or having created it, could have subjected it to qualifications and restrictions or defined the conditions under which it could be exercised. The argument for ouster is based in such cases on the presumed intention of the Legislature that the right was intended to be exercised only in the manner prescribed by Act that created it, and if that presumption is correct, the Civil Courts never acquired any jurisdiction to adjudicate on it as the very Act that created it also declared that it should be excluded from the Civil Court's cognizance, and the creation and ouster being simultaneous, the Civil Courts never had any jurisdiction in respect of it.""
35.
 Various provisions of the Governing Law have been thoughtfully considered and in my considered view, it is one of the unique statutes I have come across, which even provides a remedy of appeal against initiation of investigation, besides making the Preliminary Determination also challengeable in appeal in terms of Section 70. Therefore, I hold that since under the Governing Law a special statutory remedy is provided and this being the subject of technical nature and that is why, quorum/composition of defendant No.2-NTC and academic qualification of its members are also mentioned, therefore, the plaintiffs can avail remedy of appeal before the Appellate Forum as mentioned under section 70 of the Governing Law.
36.
 The above view is further endorsed by the Judgment of Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan v. Mian Nisarl Elahi and others (supra) cited by Mr. Khalid Jawed Khan. In the above case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has deprecated the practice of challenging initial orders passed by Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (""SECP"") directly before the High Court in its writ jurisdiction, while making an observation that dispute is highly of technical nature and could have been resolved only through special expertise (available with SECP). While setting aside the Judgment of Lahore High Court, the Hon'ble Apex Court sent the cases back to SECP to be decided by its appellate authority while making an observation that a lenient view should be taken with regard to condonation of delay. However, in present case, the difficulty in availing such remedy would be the period of limitation as in terms of subsection (2) of Section 70, thirty (30) days' time is prescribed for preferring an appeal against the Preliminary Determination, which has already ended. Undisputedly, plaintiffs came to know about the Preliminary Determination when they filed second injunction application (C.M.A.No.15958 of 2016, as referred in preceding paragraphs), that is, on 14.11.2016, but as discussed earlier, no appeal has been preferred till date.
37.
 Another reported decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court handed down in Muhammad Mubeen-us-Salam's case (supra) provides an answer, inter alia, where the Court had enlarged the time of filing appeals before the Service Tribunal, as due to litigation the appeals sought to be filed had become time barred. Consequently, in instant case also time is enlarged and present plaintiffs of this Suit can file the Appeal(s) against the Preliminary Determination before the Appellate Tribunal under Section 70 of the Governing Law within fifteen (15) days from the date of this Judgment.
38.
 While hearing an appeal of Plaintiffs against Preliminary Determination, the Appellate Forum of defendant No.2-NTC shall take into account the observations made in the following paragraphs with regard to certain portions/paragraphs of their Preliminary Determination:--
i)
 The Appellate Forum of defendant No.2-NTC will reconsider its finding on the market share which has been mentioned in paragraph-9 with the caption ""Standing of the Application"" (of the Preliminary Determination) particularly after exclusion of three interested parties, as mentioned in paragraph 8.3. This market share is mentioned in the Table-I.
ii)
 The Appellate Forum should also reconsider certain aspects of confidentiality as mentioned in its Preliminary Determination, inter alia, as prices of the investigated products could have been obtained from the local market of exporting country, that is, China. Even this information is obtainable and ascertainable from special bulletins.
iii)
 Similarly, data obtained from Customs Valuation Department usually is in public domain and it cannot be treated as confidential. Even Customs Valuation Department is posting valuation table on its website. Unless otherwise barred by any statute or rules, the information and database about prices may not be treated as confidential, primarily on the touchstone of Article 19A of the Constitution of Pakistan and the Freedom of Information Ordinance, 2002.
iv)
 Defendant No.2-NTC is to ensure that the term used in the Governing Law about accuracy of the complaint impliedly includes that interested parties under the garb of such complaint 
should not oust their competitor(s) from business and decisions of defendant No.2-NTC should not be resulting in creating directly or indirectly any monopoly or cartel of few entities or 
businesses.
v)
 In terms of Sections 11 and 12 of the Governing Law, where amongst other, the terms physical characteristics is also mentioned, which, in my considered view, should also mean that quality of the product under investigation be also evaluated by the defendant No.2-NTC. To further clarify, for instance, if Pakistani importers are importing raw material product for 
making finished goods of superior quality than the one locally manufactured by their competitors, then a very cautious approach is required on the part of NTC while determining/ deciding a complaint, inter alia, as it is also a right of every local consumer/customer to choose a best available quality 
product.
39.
 It is also necessary to observe that the vast discretion 
available with defendant No.2-NTC is still a structured one, as judicially pronounced from time to time and particularly by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in its famous reported decisions, viz. Chairman, Regional Transport Authority, [PLD 1991 Supreme Court page-14] 
and PLD 2014 Supreme Court page-131 {both decisions are mentioned in the title}. It may be advantageous to reproduce a relevant paragraph from the above decision of Chairman, Regional Transport Authority:--
 "". . . . . . . Structuring discretion means regularizing it, organizing it, producing order in it, so that decisions will achieve a higher quality of justice .. The seven instruments that are most useful in the structuring of discretionary power are open plans, open policy statements, open rules, open findings, open reasons, open precedents, and fair informal procedure ...When legislative bodies delegate discretionary power without meaningful standards, administrators should develop standards at the earliest feasible time, and then, as circumstances permit, should further confine their own discretion through principles and rules. The movement from vague standards to definite standards to broad principles to rules may be accomplished by policy statements in any form, by adjudicatory opinions, or by exercise of the rule making power .. When legislative bodies delegate discretionary power without meaningful standards, administrators should develop standards at the earliest feasible time, and then, as circumstances permit, should further confine their own discretion through principles and rules.""
 Secondly, the discretion conferred upon the defendant No.2-NTC is coupled with an implied obligation that defendant No.2-NTC has to discharge its function in a fair, just and reasonable manner as enjoined by Section 20A of the General Clauses Act, 1897; and
 Thirdly, if any party is claiming confidentiality about any information then such a request for keeping the information confidential shall be considered on the touchstone of Article 19A of the Constitution of Pakistan, relating to the access to information, the pronouncement in Hamid Mir's case (ibis) as well as the Freedom of Information Ordinance, 2002.
40.
 From the perusal of unreported precedents relied upon by the learned counsel for the Plaintiffs, it appears that defendant No.2-NTC has certain administrative issues and its Senior Officials like Members and Chairman litigated in connection with their own employment issues, that resulted in impeding the function of defendant No.2-NTC. In my considered view, role of National Tariff Commission is not only a very significant but also an onerous one, in the wake of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (""CPEC""); although CPEC is considered to be an Economic programe for regional connectivity, but at the same time, Defendant No.2-NTC besides other government functionaries will have to ensure that local industry is not destroyed or in other words, the imports from China should not result in threat of material injury or causing material retardation of the establishment of a domestic industry as envisaged in the definition of injury contained in the Governing Law. Defendant No.1 (Federal Government) is directed to ensure, inter alia, by improving the capacity of defendant No.2-NTC to meet impending challenges. Concerned Ministry, its Secretary and the Minister are responsible for ensuring compliance of these observations. Much acclaimed business opportunities in CPEC must focus on the fact that it should also result in enhancing/boosting exports of Pakistan, resulting in reduction of trade deficit. 
 Issue No.3. 
41.
 Since the reported decisions relied upon by Defendants; their ratio and dicta, both are applicable to the issues at hand, therefore, I hold that the present suit as framed is not maintainable and is accordingly dismissed.
42.
 The Appellate Tribunal while considering the observations mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, will decide the Appeal of present Plaintiffs, if preferred within the time prescribed herein above, in accordance with l aw.
43.
 Parties are left to bear their own costs. Suit stands disposed of.

 MUHAMMAD FAISAL KAMAL ALAM, J.---
Plaintiffs have brought this action at law primarily against defendant No.2-Natonal Tariff Commission (""NTC"") that while conducting an investigation in respect of product Continuous Casting Billets (""C.C. Billets"") imported by the plaintiffs, the defendant No.2-NTC is not acting within parameters of law. Plaint contains the following prayer clause:--
""PRAYERS
 The Plaintiffs herein above mentioned humbly pray for the following:--
1. The Honourable High Court may be pleased to declare that the investigation initiated by the Defendant No.2 is unlawful and illegal, and hence of no legal effect;
2. The Honourable High Court may be pleased to declare that the Defendant No.2 had acted unlawfully and illegally in depriving the Plaintiffs of the complete copy of the application, along with all annexures and evidence, on the basis of alleged confidentiality;
3. That the Honourable High Court may be pleased to restrain the Defendants from initiating, conducting or concluding the impugned investigation (as mentioned in Public Notice dated 05.08.2015) against the producers / importers of hot rolled steel billets;
4. That in the alternative, the Honourable High Court may be pleased to restrain the Defendants from conducting and / or concluding the investigation without affording the Plaintiffs a copy of the application submitted by the applicants to Defendant No.2, inclusive of all evidence attached therewith, an opportunity to be heard, as well as all other legal rights as available under the law;
5. That the Honourable High Court may be pleased to award the costs of the suit to the plaintiffs;
6. That the Honourable High Court may be pleased to award any other relief as it may deem appropriate in the facts and circumstances of the instant case.""
2.
 On issuance of notice, defendant No.2-NTC has contentiously contested the case and claim of plaintiffs by filing their counter affidavits to different interlocutory applications filed by the plaintiff, to which the latter filed Affidavit-in-Rejoinder.
3.
 Since the controversy at hand does not involve such facts, which are triable issues, therefore, by consent of the parties, it was decided that this matter should be decided on the basis of legal issues, therefore, vide order dated 16.01.2017, following consent issues were settled:--
 1. Whether the suit as framed and filed is maintainable in law?
2. Whether the requirement of Sections 31 and 33 of Anti-Dumping Duties Act, 2015, has been complied with or not?
4.
 While writing Judgment, it is deemed appropriate that though a formal but a necessary issue should also be framed to the effect that:
 3. What should the decree be?
5.
 Succinctly, Plaintiffs are engaged in the business of importing ""hot rolled steel billets"" (raw material), for the purpose of manufacturing steel bars through a metal working process.
6.
 As per learned counsel, a Complaint has been lodged with the Defendant No.2 against the Plaintiffs that the latter have committed an act of dumping the above product in local market, that is, introduced into the Commerce of Pakistan. Subsequently, a Public Notice dated 05.10.2015 was published in the Daily Express ""Tribune"" by the Defendant No.2 under Anti-Dumping Duties Act, 2015, (""Governing Law""). The investigation is in respect of C.C. Billets exported by China into Pakistan. Hence, the above C.C. Billets are the investigated product in term of Section 2(k) of the Governing Law.
7.
 In the intervening period, defendant No.2-NTC has given its Preliminary Determination about the subject product. This report dated 22.04.2016, has been appended as Annexure ""A"" with C.M.A.No.15958 of 2016, preferred by the plaintiff and seeking a restraining order against defendant No.2-NTC from passing a final determination in the matter. In addition to this, another application being C.M.A.No.15780 of 2016 was filed for initiating contempt proceedings against officials of defendant No.2-NTC.
8.
 The grievance of the Plaintiffs is that the Defendant No.2 has not provided them a complete copy of the complaint lodged by (i) A mreli Steels Limited, Karachi (ii) Agha Steel Industries, Karachi, and (iii) ASG Metals Limited, Karachi, (Complainants/Interested Parties). Subsequently, Amreli Steels Limited was impleaded as defendant No.3, vide order dated 08.02.2017.
9.
 Mr. Haider Waheed, learned counsel vehemently argued that it is plaintiffs' statutory right in terms of Section 28 and Section 33 of the Governing Law to be provided the full text of written application along with record/material relied upon by the above Applicants / Complainants and the Plaintiffs have under the latter provision has a right to see the information relating to the subject Complaint. It was further argued that only fetter to the above provision is Section 31, which pertains to the confidentiality, but in Section 31 itself the confidentiality is qualified (conditional) and has been explained in detail; that includes business or trade secrets, production process and other operational and financial information, which are not publicly available. To justify his submissions, the plaintiffs' counsel has drawn the attention of the Court to certain portion of the Complaint in which normal export price and other components are missing, rather they are deleted through asterisk and at page 543 of the case file it has been alleged that the goods imported by plaintiffs have a dumping margin of 46.86% which plaintiffs' side seriously questions besides impugning the entire proceedings. It would be advantageous to reproduce Section 31 herein under:--
""31. Confidentiality.-(1) Subject to subsection (2), the Commission shall, during and after an investigation, keep confidential any information submitted to it and such information shall not be disclosed without specific permission of the party submitting it.
(2)
 Any information which is-
(a)
 by nature confidential, because its disclosure shall be of significant competitive advantage to a competitor, or because its disclosure would have a significantly adverse effect upon a person supplying the information, or upon a person from whom the information was acquired;
(b)
 determined by the Commissioner to be of a confidential nature for any other reason; or
(c)
 provided as confidential by parties to an investigation, shall, on good cause shown, be kept confidential by the Commission.
(3)
 The following types of information shall be deemed to be by nature confidential, unless the Commission determines that disclosure in a particular case would neither be of significant competitive advantage to a competitor nor have a significantly adverse effect upon a person supplying the information or upon a person from whom such information was acquired, namely: --
(a)
 business or trade secrets concerning the nature of a product, production processes, operations, production equipment, or machinery;
(b)
 information concerning financial condition of a company which is not publicly available; and
(c)
 information concerning costs, identification of customers, sales, inventories, shipments, or amount or source of any income, profit, loss or expenditure related to manufacture and sale of a product.
(4)
 Any party seeking any information to be kept confidential shall request for the same at the time the information is submitted, along with the reasons warranting confidentiality. The Commission shall consider such request expedite ously keeping the information confidential is not warranted.
(5)
 Any party submitting any information with the request to keep it confidential shall furnish non-confidential summary of all such information. Such summary may take the form of ranges or indexation of figures provided in the confidential version or marked deletions in text or in such other form as the Commission may require:
Provided that such non-confidential summary shall permit a reasonable understanding of the substance of the information submitted in confidence:
Provided further that any deletion in text shall, unless otherwise allowed by the Commission, only relate to names of the buyer or supplier.
(6)
 In exceptional circumstances, any party submitting confidential information may indicate that such information is not susceptible of summary, in which case a statement of the reasons why summarization is not possible shall be provided. If the Commissioner concludes that the non-confidential summary provided fails to satisfy the requirements of subsection (5), it may determine that the request for keeping the information confidential is not warranted.
(7)
 If the Commission finds that a request for keeping the information confidential is not warranted, and if the supplier of such information is unwilling to make it public or to authorize the disclosure in generalized or summary form, the Commission shall disregard such information and return the same to the party submitting it.
(8)
 Subject to subsection (9), notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or in any other law for the time being in force, any confidential information received or obtained, directly or indirectly, by the Commissioner pursuant to or in connection with an investigation shall not be subject to disclosure by the Commission Government or a Provincial Government without the prior permission of the party submitting such confidential information.
(9)
 The provisions of subsection (8) shall not preclude the supply of any information called for by the Appellate Tribunal pursuant to section 72:
Provided that the obligation to protect confidential information as provided for in this Chapter shall, mutatis mutandis, extend to the Appellate Tribunal.""
10.
 It was further argued that the defendant No.2 in utter disregard of other statutory provision has accepted the subject Complaint for hearing. To explain this contention, the learned counsel has made a Reference to Sections 20, 21, 22 and Subsection 2 (b) of Section 20, inter alia, providing that the application / complaint should disclose the evidence of dumping and injury; similarly Section 21 enjoins that a notice to be given to the Government of each exporting country; in the present case China, whereas, Section 23 provides that defendant No.2/Commission should first examine the accuracy and adequacy of the evidence and where after, the application / complaint shall be set down for a proper investigation.
11.
 The Plaintiffs' side further contends that the Complainants in the present case do not even fulfill the criteria mentioned in Section 24 of the Governing Law, primarily relating to the production capacity. To further fortify this argument, plaintiffs' legal team has relied upon the language of subsection (2) of Section 24, which is in a negative command, which according to him, should be interpreted strictly being mandatory in nature. Further arguments from the plaintiffs' side were advanced to show that in view of the above provision, the defendant No.2 has to pass a preliminary order about the competency of the Applicants / Complaints before initiating the subject investigation against the plaintiffs. As per learned counsel for the Plaintiffs, the present Complainants /Applicants neither constitute 25% (twenty five percent) of the total production of market share nor fulfills the 50% threshold of collective output, hence their complaint before defendant No.2-NTC is liable to be dismissed. In this regard he has referred to public advertisement appended as Annexure ""A"" with the Plaintiffs' Rejoinder, in which it is mentioned that the total production capacity of Still Mills Manufactures in Pakistan is seven million Metric Ton and due to certain Government policies they were compelled to reduce their production to only fifty percent. As per learned counsel if the interview of CEO of one of the Complainants (interested party) Amreli Steels Limited (defendant No.3) is read, which he has annexed with his Affidavit-in-Rejoinder, if would be clear that total capacity of Amreli Steels Limited is two lac metric ton only and if the other Complainants, for the arguments sake are also joined with Amreli Steels Limited then the accumulative total production would be six lac metric ton. Plaintiffs' counsel has referred to its covering letter of 15.09.2015, under which they have filed their Reply / Comments before defendant No.2-NTC in response to the investigation under dispute bearing Case No.36 of 2015/NTC/CCB. This covering letter and Reply are appended with Affidavit-in-Rejoinder of plaintiffs, which they have filed as rebuttal to the counter affidavit of defendants to C.M.A.No.12609 of 2015, whereunder plaintiffs have sought an interim injunctive relief.
12.
 Primarily, the plaintiffs' side laid foundation of their arguments on section 31 of the Governing Law. The crux of the arguments is that unless defendant No.2-NTC meets the test of Section 31 (confidentiality) of the Governing Law, latter (defendant No.2-NTC) is under an obligation to provide the entire complaint along with annexures to the plaintiffs enabling them to file a comprehensive reply. The onus is on defendant No.2-NTC to show ""good cause"" for not disclosing the contents of entire complaint, which onus defendants have failed to discharge. It was further argued that the Questionnaire, which is annexed as Annexure 'F/1' at page-489, contains indexation and other asterisk and the actual figures as contained in the complaint of above named complainants including defendant No.3 has not been disclosed by defendant No.2-NTC to the plaintiffs and thus the latter deprived of their right to a fair trial as envisaged under Article 10A read with Article 19A, relating to freedom of information, of the Constitution of Pakistan.
13.
 In his rebuttal by filing a comprehensive synopsis, the plaintiffs' counsel has reiterated that even information within public domain has also been withheld in the questionnaire, which created impediment for the plaintiffs to submit their complete reply and that is why they have submitted their incomplete response as referred hereinabove.
 As per plaintiffs, defendant No.2-NTC has given the details of Chinese Exporters and the quantity they have exported, but yet Commission did not have exporting price, which is not believable and can easily be obtained from the Chinese Market by defendant No.2-NTC as well as through other material available, for instance, London Metal Bulletin and the Chinese Metal Bulletin. Similarly, pivotal factor in determining the injury is the calculation of normal value of the investigated product. As per the plaintiffs' counsel, normal value indexed by defendant No.2-NTC in its questionnaire in Table-2 under clause 8.6, (available at page-539 of the case file), is completely erroneous and imaginary as normal value can be calculated or determined by applying standard methods including the one mentioned hereinabove. Consequently, the plaintiffs have challenged the dumping margin of 46.86% as mentioned under clause-9 of the questionnaire -Table-3. Plaintiffs' counsel has cited the Judgments mentioned in the title of this decision to fortify his submissions.
14.
 The above arguments were controverted by the legal team of defendants Nos.1 and 2; Mr. Ali Almani and Mr. Ahmed Shiraz (Legal Advisor of NTC). According to defendants' counsel, while conducting investigation against the plaintiffs, defendant No.2-NTC has complied with requisite statutory formalities and the entire investigation up to the stage of Preliminary Determination is carried out and completed through due process of law.
15.
 As per defendants' counsel, defendant No.2-NTC had first made efforts to obtain information and other data about the subject dispute from Chinese Exporters through Chinese Embassy at Islamabad, besides, sending a questionnaire to Pakistani importers including the plaintiffs. Unfortunately, no information was shared by Chinese Exporters and even conduct of Pakistani Importers is also not forthcoming, except those which are mentioned in paragraph-15-3 of the Preliminary Determination. It is further argued that the Governing Law itself is quite equitable in nature and unlike other statutes, in terms of Section 70 thereof, even an investigation of the nature is also appealable before the Appellate Tribunal, thus, the plaintiffs have every right to agitate their grievances before the Appellate Tribunal established under the Governing Law, which is a special statute, instead of pursuing the present lis, which otherwise tantamount to strangulating the statutory provisions of the Governing Law as this Court is a final Court of Appeal against the decisions of the Appellate Tribunal in terms of subsection (13) of Section 70 of the Governing Law.
 It was further argued by defendants' legal team that investigation is only undertaken if it appears to defendant No.2-NTC that act of dumping is causing injury to the local industry. Mr. Ali Almani has referred to the Binder No.A and read the internationally accepted concept of dumping. He then referred to relevant Articles of the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, besides citing case-law of foreign jurisdictions in support of his stance that confidentiality clause is not something unusual in the Governing Law, but similar clauses do exist in the laws of all those countries, where the Anti-Dumping Regime are functioning. It would be advantageous to reproduce the relevant concept on 'dumping' as under:--
""The term ""Dumping"" is recognized as a practice of selling a product in a foreign country for less than the prevailing price of the same product in the domestic country or the manufacturing cost of the product. Many countries have declared dumping as an illegal business practice to protect their domestic industries from such unfair competition. If a company situated in a country exports a product at an export price lower than the normal price it charges in its domestic market, it is said to be ""dumping"" the product into another Country. This form of price differentiation between markets is not a prohibited practice under international trade agreements.
The only unacceptable and harmful type of dumping is predatory dumping, which happens when a foreign firm, with the help of huge subsidies from its Government, sells goods at lower prices or below cost of manufacturing in the domestic market of the importing country in order to eliminate domestic producers and gain monopoly. It can harm the domestic industry by reducing its sales volume in market shares, as well as its sales prices, resulting in decline in profitability, job losses and, in the worst case, in the domestic industry going out of business and thus creating monopolistic situations. Such dumping, where the dumping firm rules the price on attaining monopoly is harmful to the entire society because it hurts not only the domestic producers but also consumers. Such business practice is clearly undesirable as viewed by a huge number of free trade opponents.
According to the World Trade Organization (WTO) Rules, a firm is said to dump if it sells its product in another country at a price less than the normal value. (Underlined for emphasis)
Remedial action in the form of Anti-Dumping measures generally involves charging extra import duty on that product from the exporting country to bring its closure to the normal value and thus remove the injury to the domestic industry in the importing country.""
 Similarly, Section 4 of the Governing Law provides_
4. Identification of dumping
.---For the purposes of this Act an investigated product shall be considered to be dumped if it is introduced into the commerce of Pakistan at a price which is less than its normal value.
16.
 It is also necessary to reproduce the relevant Articles hereunder of the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 to which Pakistan is one of the signatories and the reason for enacting the Governing Law:
 ""Members hereby agree as follows:
PART 1
Article 1
Principles
An anti-dumping measure shall be applied only under the circumstances provided for in Article VI of GATT, 1994 and pursuant to investigations initiated and conducted in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. The following provisions govern the application of Article VI of GATT, 1994 in so far as action is taken under anti-dumping legislation or regulations.
2.1 For the purpose of this Agreement, a product is to be considered as being dumped, i.e. introduced into the commerce of another country at less than its normal value, if the export price of the product exported from one country to another is less than the comparable price, in the ordinary course of trade, for the like product when destined for consumption in the exporting country.
6.5 Any information which is by nature confidential (for example, because its disclosure would be of significant competitive advantage to a competitor or because its disclosure would have a significantly adverse effect upon a person supplying the information or upon a person from whom that person acquired the information), or which is provided on a confidential basis by parties to an investigation shall, upon good cause shown, be treated as such by the authorities. Such information shall not be disclosed without specific permission of the party submitting it.
6.5.1 The authorities shall require interested parties providing confidential information to furnish non-confidential summaries thereof. These summaries shall be in sufficient detail to permit a reasonable understanding of the substance of the information submitted in confidence. In exceptional circumstances, such parties may indicate that such information is not susceptible of summary. In such exceptional circumstances, a statement of the reasons why summarization is not possible must be provided.
6.5.2 If the authorities find that a request for confidentiality is not warranted and if the supplier of the information is either unwilling to make the information public or to authorize its disclosure in generalized or summary form, the authorities may disregard such information unless it can be demonstrated to their satisfaction from appropriate sources that the information is correct.""
[Underlined to add emphasis]
17.
 Defendants' counsel has also relied upon number of reported decisions (Supra) in support of his arguments that rule of adequate and efficacious alternate remedy in statutory hierarchy as is mentioned in the Governing Law, is not only applicable to the exercise of writ jurisdiction but also to the proceedings of the nature, though here it is termed as rule of implied ouster.
18.
 With regard to the arguments of the plaintiffs' side that the Complainants including defendant No.3 do not constitute 50% of market share, it was stated that this aspect was specifically dealt with while passing the Preliminary Determination by defendant No.2-NTC; Paragraphs Nos. 8 to 9.5 of Preliminary Determination were referred by defendants' side in relation to the market shares of the complainant, besides making a reference to page-517 of main file, which is one of the sections of the impugned Questionnaire dealing with the issue of market share under Section 24 (of the Governing Law).
19.
 Mr. Khalid Jawed Khan, learned counsel for defendant No.3 based his arguments on various statutory provisions of the Governing Law. He referred to Section 25 to advance his contention that defendant No.2-NTC can even Suo Moto take notice of dumping of goods in Pakistan, which is causing injury to local industry and, therefore, plea taken by the plaintiffs about inadequacy of requisite market shares of the Complainant is meritless. He further contended that Anti-Dumping Duty is only leviable when the act of Anti-Dumping is causing injury to the Complainants or local industry in terms of Section 3 of the Governing Law. It was further averred that the Governing Law itself provides checks and balances on defendant No.2-NTC and the onus is on latter to prove the material injury cause to the local industry. It was further argued that if every investigation, which otherwise is initiated after preliminary enquiry, is restrained, then defendant No.2-NTC would become dysfunctional. Learned counsel representing defendant No.3, while summing up his arguments has relied upon the judgment of SECP v. Mian Nisar Elahi (supra), that time can be enlarged by this Court, which will enable the plaintiffs to file their appeal before the Appellate Tribunal in terms of Section 70 of the Governing Law, if in the event, this Court comes to the conclusion that present suit is not maintainable.
20.
 With the able assistance of learned counsel representing respective parties, the record of the case is examined and their submissions are thoughtfully considered.
21.
 In compliance of the observations, Mr. Ahmed Shiraz (Legal Advisor) of defendant No.2-NTC has submitted an additional Information in the form of a Binder, in which record and proceedings of the impugned complaint, which is pending before the said defendant No.2-NTC, has been made available, besides, extract of relevant provisions/Articles of the GATT, 1994 and one of the precedents in which Egyptian Authority; viz. 'Anti-Dumping, Subsidy and Safeguard Department' sought information from Pakistan as an exporting country of the product Matches (in Boxes). The above questionnaire of Egyptian Jurisdiction is a non-confidential version in which crucial information has either been indexed or left blank.
22.
 Anti-Dumping Duties Rules, 2001, have been referred and particularly sub-rules d, e, f, g of Rule 3, to support their contention that defendant No.2-NTC sought all that information from the interested parties / complainants, which was required to evaluate the accuracy of complaint. It was further argued that at National Tariff Commission, transparency is maintained by maintaining a public file relating to each investigation containing information, but obviously not the confidential one covered under Section 31 of the Governing Law; in this regard Rules 3 and 7 of the Anti-Dumping Rules, 2001, are referred. It would be advantageous to reproduce the above discussed Rules:
""3. Disclosure in application.---
An application shall, in addition to the information specified in section 20 of the Ordinance, contain such information as is reasonably available to an applicant on the following, namely:--
(a) name, address, telephone number, facsimile number and electronic mail address of the applicant;
(b) the identity of domestic industry by or on behalf of which the application is being made, including the names, addresses and telephone numbers, facsimile numbers and electronic mail addresses of all other known producers or, association of producers which is a trade organisation as defined in the Trade Organisations Ordinance, 1961 (XLV of 1961), and has been granted or deemed to have been granted a licence thereunder, in domestic industry;
(c) information relating to the degree of domestic industry support for the application, including--
(i) the total volume and value of domestic production of a domestic like product; and
(ii) the volume and value of a domestic like product produced by the applicant and by each domestic producer identified;
(d) a complete description of the allegedly dumped product, including the technical characteristics and uses of such product and its current customs tariff classification number as specified in the First Schedule to the Customs Act, 1969 (IV of 1969);
(e) the country in which the allegedly dumped product is manufactured or produced and, if it is imported from a country other than the country of manufacture or production, the intermediate country from which the product is imported;
(f) the name and address of each person the applicant believes sells the allegedly dumped product and the proportion of total exports to Pakistan that person accounted for daring the most recent twelve-month period;
(g) information on prices at which the product in question iv sold when destined for consumption in domestic market of the country of export or origin or, where appropriate, information on the prices at which the product is sold from the country of export or origin to a third country or on the constructed value of the allegedly dumped product, and information on export prices or, where appropriate, on the prices at which the allegedly dumped product is first resold to an independent buyer in Pakistan, and on any adjustments as provided for in section 11 of the Ordinance.
7. Public file to be maintained for interested party and access thereto
.---(1) The Commission shall establish and maintain a public file relating to each investigation or review pursuant to the Ordinance and subject to the requirement to protect confidential information under section 31 of the Ordinance, the Commission shall place in such file-
 (a) all public notices relating to an investigation or review;
(b) all materials, including questionnaires, responses to questionnaires, and written communications submitted to the Commission;
 (c) all other information developed or obtained by the Commission; and
(d) any other documents the Commission deems appropriate for disclosure to an interested party.
(2) The public file to be maintained under sub-rule (I) shall be available to any interested party for review and copying at the offices of the Commission, during such time as the Commission may notify, throughout the course of an investigation or review and any appeal under section 64 of the Ordinance.""
23.
 The preamble of the Governing Law itself conveys the object of its enactment, inter alia, in order to implement the international obligation of Pakistan being one of the signatories of General Agreement on Tariff and Trade, 1994 (""GATT""). To give effect to this multilateral treaty, a legislative instrument is required under Article 70, sub-article (2) read with item/paragraph No.3 of Fourth Schedule of Federal Legislative List of the Constitution of Pakistan.
24.
 It is also noteworthy that the Governing Law is quite flexible; Section 46 whereof provides a concept of price undertaking, that is, if the National Tariff Commission in its Preliminary Determination has come to a conclusion that the investigated product has in fact caused the injurious effect of dumping then on the undertaking of exporters that they will not export the product at the dumped price, the imposition of anti-dumping duty can either be suspended or terminated. This shows the inbuilt checks and balances in the Governing Law and apparently these options and discretions are provided to make this statute a practical and workable one as far as possible.
Issue No.2 should be decided first.
25.
 To answer this issue, the impugned Anti-Dumping Importer's Questionnaire with regard to the Product Under Investigation-POI (available at pages-489 to 649) has been perused together with the Report (of 22.04.2016) on Preliminary Determination, available in second part from pages-157 to 225, delivered by the Chairman and the Members of defendant No.2-NTC.
26.
 The questionnaire contain list of exporters but since they all are based in China and did not provide information, therefore, no data was prepared in this regard, but to determine the export price and normal value in terms of sections 5 and 6 of the Governing Law, which is a basic component for reaching the dumping figure causing injury, the defendant No.2-NTC has used indexation. This is a main bone of contention of plaintiff that the defendant No.2-NTC should have disclosed the actual figure provided by interest parties including defendant No.3 (Amreli Steel Limited). It is strenuously argued by legal team of the plaintiffs that the crucial paragraph of questionnaire, where information provided by interested parties / complainants, should have been disclosed, but defendant No.2-NTC has inserted asterisk, due to which the plaintiffs are unable to have a reasonable understanding of questionnaire and sent an abridged version of Reply as referred in the foregoing paragraphs.
27.
 On the other hand learned counsel representing defendant No.2-NTC and defendant No.3 have argued that above being a vital information is fully covered under section 31 of the Governing Law relating to the confidentiality. It was further argued that disclosure of all the information as provided by interested parties/complainants would totally expose complainants' confidential data to the plaintiffs, which admittedly are their competitors.
28.
 Interestingly, the above questionnaire has been sent under a correspondence dated 07.08.2015 by defendant No.2-NTC to one of the plaintiffs, [available at page-485 of the case file], in which the present plaintiffs have also been given an option to provide the answer to the questionnaire in confidential and non-confidential version in the light of Article 6.5.1 of the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of GATT, 1994, (already reproduced hereinabove); it means that plaintiffs have also been given an equal opportunity for not disclosing that information which falls within section 31 of the Governing Law.
29.
 Arguments of plaintiffs' counsel that the indexation and asterisks used in the questionnaire is even contrary to the concept of indexation and ranges are wrongly applied merely to technically oust the plaintiffs from the contest and to deprive the plaintiffs from rebutting the evidence of interested parties/complainants, could not be accepted for the reason that Section 31 of the Governing Law itself gives protection to the confidential information which provision is in line with the Clauses / Articles of the afore referred Implementation Agreement. The other argument of Mr. Haider Waheed, that first the defendant No.2-NTC should make a determination and show a 'good cause' as mentioned in subsection 2(b) and (c) of Section 31 of the Governing Law and then can use indexation in the questionnaire, is also devoid of merits, as already in the Governing Law different stages of the proceeding have been mentioned and it is not necessary for defendant No.2-NTC to first pass an independent decision or determination, as argued by plaintiffs' side, before delivering its Preliminary Determination. At best, defendant No.2-NTC can forward its determination that was given to an interested party invoking the confidentiality under subsection (4) of Section 31 of the Governing Law, at the time of filing the complaint, also to Respondents, in the present case, the plaintiffs. This aspect of confidentiality has already been determined as pointed out by Mr. Ali Almani (counsel for defendants) in paragraph-18 of the Report on Preliminary Determination dated 22.04.2016 (""Preliminary Determination""), therefore, I answer the second issue in the terms that while sending the afore referred questionnaire to the plaintiffs, defendant No.2-NTC has complied with the requirement of Section 31 of the Governing Law, whereas the plaintiffs are entitled to see and obtain copies of that information submitted to defendant No.2-NTC by the complainants/interested parties, which is not confidential and is relevant to the presentation of the case of the plaintiffs as envisaged under section 33 of the Governing Law, which information is accessible by virtue of the aforereferred correspondence of defendant No.2-NTC dated 25.08.2015.
 Plaintiffs' side has relied upon a decision of World Trade Organization (WTO) Appellate Body, on a complaint preferred by Japan, European Union and other countries against the measures adopted by Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China (MOFCOM) imposing Anti-Dumping duties on the products exported from Japan and European Union, was set aside on various grounds including the one mentioned in paragraph-6.1 that China acted inconsistently with Article 6.5 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and permitted the full text of the reports contained in appendix 5 and appendix 8 to the petition, as well as MOFCOM improperly relied on the Market share of dumped imports, and its flawed price report. This decision in my humble view does neither advance the case of plaintiffs nor answers the issues involved in the present proceeding.
 
Now adverting to Issue No.1. 
30.
 The unreported decisions relied upon by the plaintiffs' side are taken into account. Two of these are relevant for discussion. The Judgment of learned Lahore High Court given in Writ Petition No.4735 of 2016, which is appended as annexure ""W/2"" with the Written Arguments of Plaintiffs and the other one is a Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court (annexure ""W/4"") handed down in number of Civil Petitions Nos. 1654, 1686, 1607 and others of 2009 filed by Messrs Waheed Sons Lahore and others versus defendant No.2-NTC, in which amongst other, the initiation of investigation on the complaint by one of the local manufacturers, Master Tiles and Ceramic Limited, was challenged. The facts are that while the parties were entangled in litigation, the National Tariff Commission first passed the Preliminary Determination, which was followed by Final Determination. In that case also the product under investigation, viz. porcelain/ceramic tiles, was being imported from China. Though the Hon'ble Apex Court set aside the decision of National Tariff Commission on the ground that composition of National Tariff Commission (present defendant No.2), as mentioned in the relevant Statute-National Tariff Commission Act, 1990 was incomplete, but the cases were remanded to present defendant No.2-NTC for decision afresh in terms of Section 11 of the above Act, while holding that a fresh decision should be given by a duly constituted Commission (NTC). However, the merits of the case were not touched upon and it was left to the Commission to decide the matter on merits. The Lahore High Court's case is not different, in which though it was held that one of the members of the Commission was not qualified to hold the Office while highlighting the importance of the NTC as an institution, but despite this irregularity, the proceeding before the Commission was not quashed but it was held in abeyance with the directions that when the composition of NTC is complete, the proceeding should be resumed. In the operative part of the Order, the learned High Court has specifically clarified that notice of initiation of proceeding which at that time was already issued, will remain intact. 
31.
 Mr. Haider Waheed, learned counsel for the plaintiffs has contended that the Preliminary Determination should be set at naught as it has been passed in violation of restraining order of this Court, which was merged in the order of 10.01.2017 and officials of defendant No.2-NTC has committed contempt of Court. Submission considered. The first ad-interim injunction granted on 22.09.2015 is somewhat conditional and subject to fulfillment of Section 33 of the Governing Law, whereas, on 22.12.2015, the restraining order was slightly modified and on 01.01.2016 the matter was adjourned with a clarification that the defendants while proceeding further in the subject investigation under dispute have to conduct themselves strictly in accordance with law. Regarding the order dated 22.12.2015, the plaintiffs filed a Review Application (C.M.A. No.18691 of 2015), contents whereof are self-explanatory. Finally, on 10.01.2017, the restraining order was lastly modified by directing the Defendants to adhere to the terms of earlier orders of 22.09.2015 and 01.01.2016.
32.
 The relevant provision of the Anti-Dumping Duties Act, 2015 (Governing Law), is also taken into account and in my considered view that under Section 68 thereof, inter alia, (relating to quorum of NTC) a Preliminary Determination of the nature can be decided by two members of defendant No.2-NTC. Admittedly, the subject Report on Preliminary Determination (as referred above) has been signed by the Chairman and one Member, therefore, the same at least on the touchstone of quorum cannot be set at naught. The concluding Paragraph of this Preliminary Determination has clearly stated that no provisional Anti-Dumping Duty has been imposed on plaintiffs in view of the fact that the restraining orders passed by the Court have restrained the defendant No.2-NTC from taking any coercive measure, thus the defendant No.2-NTC refrained itself from imposing any provisional Anti-Dumping Duties on imports of the investigated products. Defendant No.2-NTC informed the counsel for the plaintiffs about Preliminary Determination vide a correspondence dated 26.05.2016 (available at Page-263 of second part of the Court file), but till date, admittedly no appeal (even under protest and without prejudice to the stance in the instant suit) as provided in section 70 of the Governing Law, has been preferred by the plaintiffs to challenge the above Preliminary Determination. Plaintiffs again sought an injunctive relief by filing another Application being C.M.A. No. 15958 of 2016 (under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2 of C.P.C.), inter alia, that defendant No.2-NTC should be restrained from passing a Final Determination, besides filing yet another application for initiating the contempt proceedings against the officials of defendant No.2-NTC.
33.
 Taking into the consideration, the above undisputed factual aspect of the case revolving around the subject Preliminary Determination and peculiar nature of the controversy as agitated in the present cause vis- -vis the Governing Law, having intricate technical characteristics, I am of the considered view that neither defendant No.2-NTC nor its officials, who have been named in the Contempt of Court Application are guilty of disobeying the order of this Court in a contumacious manner, therefore, no proceeding under Contempt of Court Act are warranted against the officials of defendant No.2-NTC and consequently, the C.M.A. No.15780 of 2016 for initiating the contempt proceeding is hereby dismissed. Thus, the Preliminary Determination cannot be set aside at this stage.
34.
 The legal team of defendants has relied upon the number of precedents, which are already mentioned in the title of this decision to advance their arguments on the principle of implied ouster; simply put, what defendants have argued that when a statutory remedy is mentioned in the statute, particularly a special statute governing the subject, then the ordinary jurisdiction of Civil Court under Section 9 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908, is also barred. On this point of law, the afore referred decision of Administrator, Thal Development (supra) handed down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, has been rightly relied upon by the defendants, wherein it has been held that since remedy of appeal was provided under Section 161 of West Pakistan Land Revenue Act, 1967, therefore, mere concession of the parties could not have conferred jurisdiction on a Court which was otherwise expressly barred by a statute and for which a specific mechanism has been provided in the hierarchy of the authority functioning under a special statute. This principle has been expounded in detail in a full bench decision of Mian Sultan (supra) (PLD 1949 Lahore 301), relevant portion whereof is reproduced hereunder for a better appreciation of this rule:
"". . . . . It is, not contended here that there is any express ouster of the Civil Court's jurisdiction because neither in the Constitution Act nor in the Orders in Council or the Electoral Rules is there any provision that Civil Courts will have no jurisdiction to entertain suits relating to an electoral right. The question falling for decision is whether on a true construction of the various provisions contained in the Orders in Council and the Electoral Rules it can be held that the jurisdiction of Civil Courts is impliedly barred. It is while determining this question that the distinction between a right which is purely the creation of a statutes and a right at common law becomes important because where a civil right did not exist before a statute was passed and was entirely created by that statute, it is reasonable to infer that the Legislature intended that right to be enforced only in the manner that the statute prescribes. In the present case the right was created by the Constitution Act and the Orders in Council issued thereunder, which, together with the Electoral Rules promulgated by the Governor in exercise of the authority conferred on him by the Act and the Orders, also contain a complete Code in regard to the manner in which a person may acquire and exercise that right and the remedies available to him in case of infringement of that right. The right, therefore, falls within that class of rights which being a creation of the statute can only be enforced in the manner prescribed by the statute creating them and are excluded from the cognizance of Civil Courts. It is this position which was intended to be expressed by the provisions of Part III of the Provincial Elections (Corrupt Practices and Election Petitions) Order to the effect that an election shall not be called in question except by an election petition, that all proceedings and applications in connection with such petition shall be dealt with by and carried on by or before the Commissioners and that the Governor's orders on the report of the Commissioners shall be final. The ouster of Civil Courts' jurisdiction in such cases rests on the construction of the statute creating the right and a special tribunal for its enforcement and if as a matter of construction of the relevant statute the Court arrives at the conclusion that the Legislature intended that the right created by the statute should only be exercised or enforced in the manner provided by that statute, then it is somewhat difficult to accept the Madras and Patna view which found favour with the Division Bench in Sat Narian Gurwala v. Hanuman Parshad (44) that if the special tribunal is not constituted or having been constituted it does not function, the Civil Courts' jurisdiction to adjudicate on that right is not affected. The new right depending for its creation on the will of the Legislature, the Legislature could well have refused to create it or having created it, could have subjected it to qualifications and restrictions or defined the conditions under which it could be exercised. The argument for ouster is based in such cases on the presumed intention of the Legislature that the right was intended to be exercised only in the manner prescribed by Act that created it, and if that presumption is correct, the Civil Courts never acquired any jurisdiction to adjudicate on it as the very Act that created it also declared that it should be excluded from the Civil Court's cognizance, and the creation and ouster being simultaneous, the Civil Courts never had any jurisdiction in respect of it.""
35.
 Various provisions of the Governing Law have been thoughtfully considered and in my considered view, it is one of the unique statutes I have come across, which even provides a remedy of appeal against initiation of investigation, besides making the Preliminary Determination also challengeable in appeal in terms of Section 70. Therefore, I hold that since under the Governing Law a special statutory remedy is provided and this being the subject of technical nature and that is why, quorum/composition of defendant No.2-NTC and academic qualification of its members are also mentioned, therefore, the plaintiffs can avail remedy of appeal before the Appellate Forum as mentioned under section 70 of the Governing Law.
36.
 The above view is further endorsed by the Judgment of Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan v. Mian Nisarl Elahi and others (supra) cited by Mr. Khalid Jawed Khan. In the above case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has deprecated the practice of challenging initial orders passed by Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (""SECP"") directly before the High Court in its writ jurisdiction, while making an observation that dispute is highly of technical nature and could have been resolved only through special expertise (available with SECP). While setting aside the Judgment of Lahore High Court, the Hon'ble Apex Court sent the cases back to SECP to be decided by its appellate authority while making an observation that a lenient view should be taken with regard to condonation of delay. However, in present case, the difficulty in availing such remedy would be the period of limitation as in terms of subsection (2) of Section 70, thirty (30) days' time is prescribed for preferring an appeal against the Preliminary Determination, which has already ended. Undisputedly, plaintiffs came to know about the Preliminary Determination when they filed second injunction application (C.M.A.No.15958 of 2016, as referred in preceding paragraphs), that is, on 14.11.2016, but as discussed earlier, no appeal has been preferred till date.
37.
 Another reported decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court handed down in Muhammad Mubeen-us-Salam's case (supra) provides an answer, inter alia, where the Court had enlarged the time of filing appeals before the Service Tribunal, as due to litigation the appeals sought to be filed had become time barred. Consequently, in instant case also time is enlarged and present plaintiffs of this Suit can file the Appeal(s) against the Preliminary Determination before the Appellate Tribunal under Section 70 of the Governing Law within fifteen (15) days from the date of this Judgment.
38.
 While hearing an appeal of Plaintiffs against Preliminary Determination, the Appellate Forum of defendant No.2-NTC shall take into account the observations made in the following paragraphs with regard to certain portions/paragraphs of their Preliminary Determination:--
i)
 The Appellate Forum of defendant No.2-NTC will reconsider its finding on the market share which has been mentioned in paragraph-9 with the caption ""Standing of the Application"" (of the Preliminary Determination) particularly after exclusion of three interested parties, as mentioned in paragraph 8.3. This market share is mentioned in the Table-I.
ii)
 The Appellate Forum should also reconsider certain aspects of confidentiality as mentioned in its Preliminary Determination, inter alia, as prices of the investigated products could have been obtained from the local market of exporting country, that is, China. Even this information is obtainable and ascertainable from special bulletins.
iii)
 Similarly, data obtained from Customs Valuation Department usually is in public domain and it cannot be treated as confidential. Even Customs Valuation Department is posting valuation table on its website. Unless otherwise barred by any statute or rules, the information and database about prices may not be treated as confidential, primarily on the touchstone of Article 19A of the Constitution of Pakistan and the Freedom of Information Ordinance, 2002.
iv)
 Defendant No.2-NTC is to ensure that the term used in the Governing Law about accuracy of the complaint impliedly includes that interested parties under the garb of such complaint should not oust their competitor(s) from business and decisions of defendant No.2-NTC should not be resulting in creating directly or indirectly any monopoly or cartel of few entities or businesses.
v)
 In terms of Sections 11 and 12 of the Governing Law, where amongst other, the terms physical characteristics is also mentioned, which, in my considered view, should also mean that quality of the product under investigation be also evaluated by the defendant No.2-NTC. To further clarify, for instance, if Pakistani importers are importing raw material product for making finished goods of superior quality than the one locally manufactured by their competitors, then a very cautious approach is required on the part of NTC while determining/ deciding a complaint, inter alia, as it is also a right of every local consumer/customer to choose a best available quality product.
39.
 It is also necessary to observe that the vast discretion available with defendant No.2-NTC is still a structured one, as judicially pronounced from time to time and particularly by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in its famous reported decisions, viz. Chairman, Regional Transport Authority, [PLD 1991 Supreme Court page-14] and PLD 2014 Supreme Court page-131 {both decisions are mentioned in the title}. It may be advantageous to reproduce a relevant paragraph from the above decision of Chairman, Regional Transport Authority:--
"". . . . . . . Structuring discretion means regularizing it, organizing it, producing order in it, so that decisions will achieve a higher quality of justice .. The seven instruments that are most useful in the structuring of discretionary power are open plans, open policy statements, open rules, open findings, open reasons, open precedents, and fair informal procedure ...When legislative bodies delegate discretionary power without meaningful standards, administrators should develop standards at the earliest feasible time, and then, as circumstances permit, should further confine their own discretion through principles and rules. The movement from vague standards to definite standards to broad principles to rules may be accomplished by policy statements in any form, by adjudicatory opinions, or by exercise of the rule making power .. When legislative bodies delegate discretionary power without meaningful standards, administrators should develop standards at the earliest feasible time, and then, as circumstances permit, should further confine their own discretion through principles and rules.""
Secondly, the discretion conferred upon the defendant No.2-NTC is coupled with an implied obligation that defendant No.2-NTC has to discharge its function in a fair, just and reasonable manner as enjoined by Section 20A of the General Clauses Act, 1897; and
Thirdly, if any party is claiming confidentiality about any information then such a request for keeping the information confidential shall be considered on the touchstone of Article 19A of the Constitution of Pakistan, relating to the access to information, the pronouncement in Hamid Mir's case (ibis) as well as the Freedom of Information Ordinance, 2002.
40.
 From the perusal of unreported precedents relied upon by the learned counsel for the Plaintiffs, it appears that defendant No.2-NTC has certain administrative issues and its Senior Officials like Members and Chairman litigated in connection with their own employment issues, that resulted in impeding the function of defendant No.2-NTC. In my considered view, role of National Tariff Commission is not only a very significant but also an onerous one, in the wake of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (""CPEC""); although CPEC is considered to be an Economic programe for regional connectivity, but at the same time, Defendant No.2-NTC besides other government functionaries will have to ensure that local industry is not destroyed or in other words, the imports from China should not result in threat of material injury or causing material retardation of the establishment of a domestic industry as envisaged in the definition of injury contained in the Governing Law. Defendant No.1 (Federal Government) is directed to ensure, inter alia, by improving the capacity of defendant No.2-NTC to meet impending challenges. Concerned Ministry, its Secretary and the Minister are responsible for ensuring compliance of these observations. Much acclaimed business opportunities in CPEC must focus on the fact that it should also result in enhancing/boosting exports of Pakistan, resulting in reduction of trade deficit. 
 
Issue No.3. 
41.
 Since the reported decisions relied upon by Defendants; their ratio and dicta, both are applicable to the issues at hand, therefore, I hold that the present suit as framed is not maintainable and is accordingly dismissed.
42.
 The Appellate Tribunal while considering the observations mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, will decide the Appeal of present Plaintiffs, if preferred within the time prescribed herein above, in accordance with l aw.
43.
 Parties are left to bear their own costs. Suit stands disposed of.

90,"FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN through Secretary Ministry of Religious and Minority Affairs, Islamabad Versus DEVRI SAHIB OF BHAI STRAMDASS OF RAHARKI","June 1, 2017","KARACHI HIGH COURT SINDH"," Honorable Justice Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui ","2019 MLD 1781","JUDGMENT
 MUHAMMAD SHAFI SIDDIQUI J.
---This civil revision application apparently shows that it is filed by four applicants i.e. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Religious and Minority Affairs, ii) The Evacuee Trust Property Board through its Chairman, iii) The Administrator, Evacuee Trust Properties and iv) Assistant Administrator, Evacuee Trust Properties. This civil revision application is signed by Advocate Abdul Razak Bhutto Advocate only on behalf of applicants, but surprisingly there is neither any memo. of appearance on record nor any Vakalatnama or any authority extended to counsel on behalf of all these four applicants. It has been further pointed out that same was the position before the appellate court when Civil Appeal No. 08 of 2002 was filed and was signed by only an Advocate claimed to have been appearing for all the appellants therein. The appellants therein are the same as in this revision. Mr. Jamshed Ahmed Faiz, Assistant Attorney General has conceded to this extent that there is no such memo. of appearance, Vakalatnama or any other authority in this regard, presented to this court or to appellate court. This could have been a courtains for the applicants, however, considering the nature of case, I proceeded to discuss the merits of the case as well.
2.
 The respondents filed suit for declaration and permanent injunction bearing Suit No. 165 of 1995 with the following prayer:
 ""a) To declare that the suit land is the personal and private property of the plaintiff and as such is not liable to be treated, declared or called 'Trust or Evacuee Trust property' and the order of defendant No.3 contained in Gazette Notification dated 7.1.1979 and any other action taken or intended to be taken by the defendants Nos.3 and 4 for treating the suit land as Trust or Evacuee Trust Property, attached to charitable, religious or Educational Trusts or institutions and/or acquiring, assuming or taking over the same for any such purpose is arbitrary, unilateral, illegal, ultra vires, in excess of jurisdiction and lawful authority and mala fide hence null and void and not binding on the rights of the plaintiff over the suit property.
 b). To restrain the defendants particularly the defendant No.4 by way of permanent injunction from holding auction for leasing out the suit land on 23.12.1986 or thereafter at any time, as intended by him and from invading the rights of the plaintiff over the suit land and from interfering in any manner with its possession and enjoyment over the suit land personally or through their agents, subordinates, servants and any man claiming through or under them.
 c). To award costs of the suit to the plaintiff and
 d). To grant any other relief as deemed fit and necessary under the circumstances of the case"".
3.
 After service, applicants Nos.2, 3 and 4 filed their written statement and the matter proceeded on merit. Respondents recorded evidence of their witnesses, namely, Mansha Ram and Naranjan Lal and produced certain documents as exhibits, but surprisingly no counsel either cross-examined witnesses of the respondents nor they led their evidence through own witnesses, consequently on consideration of the evidence and documents produced, suit of the respondents was decreed. Aggrieved of the judgment and decree, it is claimed that appeal was preferred by four applicants, however, appeal too was dismissed.
4.
 I have heard learned counsel and perused the relevant record.
5.
 The prime consideration for the trial court as well as appellate court was that i) whether suit property was Evacuee Trust Property or Evacuee Property? and ii) As to whether plaintiffs are the owners of the subject-land?. The judgment and decree of the trial court was passed on 12.08.1997 and the appeal was preferred belatedly after four years. Apart from the fact that there is no iota of evidence to consider the contentions of applicants, appeal itself was barred by time. In the judgment of the trial court, evidence of two witnesses led by the respondents was considered in line of documents such as Form-VII-B issued by Mukhtiarkar, Certificate dated 12.12.1986 showing agricultural land situated in Deh Raharki at Exh.77, true copy of order of custodian passed on 10.06.1974 at Exh. 78, Dhal receipts in several numbers with copy of Takrari Register, issued on 17.11.1958, copy of form VII at Exh.86 and other copy of Form VII issued on 28.09.1974 and several Dhall receipts along with Form Golf showing appeal and Bastagi of the year 1972-73, were considered. Although appeal was belatedly barred by time, yet appellate court considered all such points for consideration as well as considered evidence available on record and upheld the judgment of the trial court and there is no ambiguity, error so far as judgment of the trial court or appellate court is concerned. It could have been very conveniently dismissed on the ground of limitation, yet appellate court deemed it appropriate to consider the merit of the case as well.
6.
 I am now confront with another point which relates to the jurisdiction of trial court which is the only ground that could upset the judgment. In the case of Evacuee Trust Property and others v. Muhammad Ramzan and others (2000 MLD 100), Court has held as under:-
 ""15. Reverting to the question of bar of jurisdiction contained in section 14 of Act XIII of 1975, a civil Court is debarred from having jurisdiction in respect of any matter which the Federal Government or any Officer appointed under the said Act is empowered to determine thereby Mr. Soomro has referred to the exclusive jurisdiction enjoyed by the chairman, Evacuee Trust Property Board under section 8 of Act XIII of 1975. Such power, again, is referable to a dispute if an evacuee property is attached to a charitable, religious, educational trust or otherwise. The provisions of Act XIII of 1975 do not create an authority in any of the functionaries thereunder to determine if a non-evacuee property is to be treated as an evacuee trust property. Consequently, the notification dated 7-1-1979 was out side the scope of Act XIII of 1975 in relation to the subject property and was, therefore, unauthorised and without jurisdiction; and, an act without jurisdiction can always be checked by a civil Court and the finding to that effect recorded in the lower appellate judgment does not call for any interference"".
In case of Begum Syeda Azra Masood v. Begum Noshaba Moeen and others (2007 SCMR 914), the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as under:
 ""8 ...The law is clearly settled that an ouster clause in any statute will only apply when the authorities constituted therein act within the four corners of the statute and if they step out of it, the protection available to the orders passed by a Tribunal of special jurisdiction is no more available and Court of plenary jurisdiction could examine the controversy"".
In the case of Gul Shah v. Hafiz Ghulam Muhammad and others (2009 SCMR 1058), the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as under:
 ""8. Admittedly, under section 14 of Act XIII, 1975 the jurisdiction of Civil Court is ousted/barred, out that jurisdiction is barred in ordinary cases and when mala fide and malice is attributed to the official respondents, then the Civil Courts are the Courts of ultimate jurisdiction and, they can decide the matter in accordance with law. In the instant case, the malice/mala fide against the official respondents is clearly reflected as P.T.O. was granted to the respondent in the year 1960 and right from year 1960 uptill 1994, there was no wrong with the respondent but when he enhanced the rent of the present petitioners being his tenants, then the present petitioners with the connivance of the official respondents took up the matter again and cancelled the P.T.O. and dragged the respondent to prolong litigation. The respondents have been allotted the suit property as back as from 1960 and they incurred huge expenses on the construction of the property and then it let out to the present petitioners. The department slept over the matter for 34 long years and then suddenly came out of slumber in the year 1994, when the petitioners agitated the matter with the respondents regarding the status of the property. So, in such-like circumstances, if there is clear cut mala fide and malice apparent on the face of record, the jurisdiction of the Civil Court cannot be ousted"".
7.
 Civil court is a court of ultimate jurisdiction and is always competent to examine whether the orders brought before it for judicial scrutiny are in accordance with legal framework and do not suffer from mala fides. The paramount rule, is to keep in mind while scrutinizing the ouster clause of any Act wherein the jurisdiction of civil court has been barred, is that if the order passed under an Act is within the competence and jurisdiction of a person who has passed the order, then certainly the debarring clause is available and that order passed by such person or authority cannot be challenged in the civil court, and if the order passed by a person or authority, is without jurisdiction or beyond the authority conferred through an Act upon the person or authority, then the civil court certainly has jurisdiction to scrutinize the decision rendered.
8.
 So far as the evidence that has come on record that could lead to one presumption that applicants have failed to establish their case, whereas, respondents by examining witnesses and by producing relevant documents have established their case to the satisfaction of the two courts below. In case of Federal Government of Pakistan v. Khursheed Zaman Khan and others (1999 SCMR 1007), the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as under:-
 ""12. In the judgment, dated 24-10-1992 (C.As. Nos.172 and 173 of 1994), the High Court did not take any decision on merits and. held the order, dated 6-8-1978 passed by the Federal Government as without lawful authority and of no legal effect on the ground that the revision petition before the Federal Government was not maintainable. We have already held that the High Court was not correct in taking the aforesaid view. In this situation normally the case would have been remanded to the High Court for decision on merits but we find that the litigation has been pending for several decades and even the writ petition before the High Court was filed over 20 years ago and, in the circumstances, we have decided to dispose of these two appeals on merits. We had heard arguments on merits also in great detail.
 In the Jamabandis, the property, subject-matter of these appeals, was throughout shown to be owned by individuals. It is not, a case where the properties were mutated in the name of a trust or charitable institution. The owners had perhaps used such property or parts thereof for some charitable purpose but such use by itself could not make the property a trust property. In the circumstances, the Chairman of the Evacuee Trust Property Board by his order, dated 28-7-1976 rightly held that the property was not trust property. However, in revision, the Federal Government by order, dated 6-8-1978 upset the order of the Chairman. From the order in revision, reproduced hereinabove, it is apparent that no weight at all was given there to the fact that, till Partition, the property, according to the records, was shown to be owned by individuals. In the circumstances, in the absence of any evidence that the owners had dedicated the property for charity, no ground was made out for setting aside the order of the Chairman. In the circumstances, the order of the Federal Government could not be sustained"".
9.
 In the absence of any evidence, written statement of applicants cannot be considered as an alternate. This is a revisional court and not the appellate court. The jurisdiction of this court as such is confined to the extent:
a)
 where the trial court exercised its jurisdiction not vested in it by law,
b)
 failed to exercise a jurisdiction so vested,
c)
 acted in the exercise of the jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity.
The exercise of revisional jurisdiction is limited only to the correction of the errors of jurisdiction committed by the courts below or if they are based on mis-reading or non-reading of evidence which is not the case here. Where courts below had applied their mind to the factual and legal aspect of the case and had given cogent reasons in support of the conclusion arrived at by them and no material mis-reading or non-reading of evidence was pointed out, interference in revisional jurisdiction has always been declined.
10.
 I do not see any substantial ground available within the frame and paramaters of section 115, C.P.C. to interfere in the concurrent findings of the two courts below. He has neither been able to point out which part of the evidence was overlooked nor he was able to point out any wrong assumption of jurisdiction either by trial court or appellate court to cause interference.
11.
 Hence, there are the reasons for dismissing this civil revision application by a short order dated 29.05.2017.

 CH. MUHAMMAD IBRAHIM ZIA, C.J.---
 The captioned appeal by leave of the Court is addressed against the judgment of the High Court dated 19.05.2016, whereby writ petition filed by respondents Nos.1 and 2, herein, has been accepted.
2.
 The precise facts giving rise to the instant appeal are that respondents Nos.1 and 2 herein, filed writ petition in the High Court alleging therein that they are permanent employees of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Audit and Accounts Department and presently are posted in grade (B-19). They alleged that the post of Director General Audit, (B-20) fell vacant after the retirement of Mr. Saeed Akhtar Malik on his superannuation, who was assigned the Additional Charge of the said post. After his retirement respondent No.1 was appointed on current charge basis vide notification dated 29.04.2015. It is further stated that according to the rules, Auditor General Pakistan has to take oath as Auditor General of Azad Jammu and Kashmir under the provisions of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act, 1974 and then he is considered as authority in respect of the matters of appointment, promotion and transfer of the officers within the department with the consultation and approval of Azad Jammu and Kashmir Council. It is further stated that respondent No.2, therein, through order dated 27.05.2015 has appointed respondent No.5, therein as Director General, Audit Azad Jammu and Kashmir without taking the oath as Auditor General of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, which is essential according to the provision of Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act, 1974. The respondents claimed that they are entitled to be considered for promotion to the aforesaid post in accordance with the qualification, seniority and eligibility. They sought cancellation of the order dated 27.05.2015 on the ground that the same has been issued without lawful authority. After necessary proceedings, the learned High Court through the impugned judgment dated 19th May, 2016, accepted the writ petition with a direction to the respondents therein to appoint any officer serving in B-19 in the department/relevant field, whosoever, appears at the top of the seniority list and also suitable. This judgment of the High Court is subject of the instant appeal by leave of the Court.
3.
 Raja Amjad Ali Khan, Advocate, counsel for the appellant after narration of necessary facts submitted that the learned High Court has wrongly entertained the writ petition as the subject matter raised in the writ petition relates to the terms and conditions of the civil servants. Thus the contesting respondents being civil servants were not competent to file the writ petition in the High Court. He submitted that admittedly no rules for appointment against the disputed post have been framed, thus, in this state of affairs, the High Court should have issued the direction to the authority for framing the rules. The High Court has failed to issue the direction to the authority, hence the judgment is not in accordance with the law. He further argued that if the impugned judgment holds the field, the powers of the rules making authority shall be prejudiced and the authority will be bound to frame the rules according to the direction of the High Court. In this state of affairs, the impugned judgment is not maintainable. Thus, while accepting this appeal the impugned judgment may kindly be set aside and consequently, the writ petition filed by the contesting respondents may kindly be dismissed.
4.
 Syed Nazir Hussain Shah Kazmi, Advocate, counsel for proforma-respondents Nos.3 to 6 adopted the arguments of the counsel for the appellant and requested for acceptance of appeal.
5.
 Mr. Muhammad Yaqoob Khan Mughal, Advocate, has filed an application on behalf of Aziz-ur-Rehman and Muhammad Hassan Rana and submitted that as the real respondents in the appeal who were posted as Director General Audit one by one in grade (B-20) have already been retired and now the applicants are holding the posts on temporary basis and they being eligible according to the rules and seniority were entitled to be permanently appointed. Thus they may be arrayed as party in the appeal and be heard.
6.
 We have considered the arguments of the learned counsel for the parties and examine the record made available. So far the first argument/objection of the counsel for the appellant that the writ petition was not maintainable as the matter raised relates to the terms and conditions of petitioners/ civil servants is concerned, in our opinion due to subsequent development this objection is mere of an academic nature as both the petitioners therein, admittedly have been retired from service. They are no more contesting the appeal. Moreover, through the impugned judgment the learned High Court has not determined any term and condition of their service. Thus the first argument having no substance stands repelled.
7.
 The appellant admitted that no departmental rules in relation to the questioned post have been framed but it is very funny that on behalf of the appellant it has been averred in the memo. of appeal as well as argued by the counsel that the High Court should have issued the direction for framing the rules. It appears that now the Courts have to remind every institution and the public functionary of its duties, which is very regrettable. According to the law every institution and public functionary are duty bond to perform their assigned functions. As in this matter according to the enforced statutory provisions of law it is the duty of the appellant to frame the rules and failure amounts to negligence. The impugned judgment of the High Court cannot be objected or challenged on the ground of negligence and violation of law by the appellant rather the appellant should rectify the wrong if not earlier then hence forward take necessary steps for framing of the rules.
8.
 The argument of the counsel for the appellant that due to the impugned judgment the powers of the rules making authority will be adversely affected, appears to be totally misconceived, as in the impugned judgment there is nothing to curtail the powers of the rules making authority. The impugned judgment of the High Court is well reasoned, consistent with the spirit of law and rules which does not call for any interference. The appellant has failed to make out any valid ground for interference in the impugned judgment.
9.
 Even otherwise, admittedly the contesting respondents Nos.1 and 2, have been retired from service hence not contesting the appeal, whereas the other respondents are proforma-respondents whose interest and stand is the same as of the appellant, thus practically there is no contesting party. In view of the principle of law laid down by this Court in the case reported as Azad Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir v. Sarfraz Alam and others [1996 SCR 326] that no appeal can be heard without there being a respondent, this appeal cannot be proceeded further.
10.
 So far the application of the interveners for impleading them as party is concerned, the question whether they are eligible to be promoted cannot be resolved in the appeal. Therefore, the application stands rejected.
 With the above observation this appeal stands dismissed with no order as to costs.

92,"LAKHRA COAL DEVELOPMENT COMPANY LTD. Versus PROVINCE OF SINDH through Chief Secretary","June 1, 2017","KARACHI HIGH COURT SINDH"," Honorable Justice Zulfiqar Ahmad Khan ","2018 CLC 896","ORDER
 ZULFIQAR AHMAD KHAN, J.--
 Through this application, the applicant who admittedly is a contractor of M/s. Lakhra Coal Development Company (LCDC) has requested for being added as party to the instant Revision Application. Undoubtedly, applicant's relationship is solely governed through a master and servant arrangement between LCDC and itself. In the given controversy where dispute is over the land granted to the Applicant and the question posed is whether LCDC's lease expired after the lapse of the term of 30 years or it was terminated which issue is solely is between the lessee and lessor. I therefore, do not find that the intervenor is either necessary or a proper party. The application being meritless is accordingly refused. The counsel has attempted to produce certain orders passed by the District Judge where he was made a party in the litigation pending before that court. As stated earlier controversy at hand is regarding expiry or termination of lease between the lessee and lessor, wherein no relief could be granted to the contractor of the lessee, and if its interests are impaired, its remedy is to file a Civil Suit against its master LCDC for any breach of their inter-se relationship.
2 and 3. Through listed application (M.A. 45 of 2017) made under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. interim injunction has been sought against the respondent from acting on their order dated 14.1.2015 or interfering with the possession of 7,942-61 acres of land situated at Lakhra Khanot, District Jamshoro till final decision of the instant Revision Application.
 When this application came up for hearing for the first time, on 20.01.2017 an ex parte interim injunction was granted to the Applicant and today, the application is heard at length for confirmation of the stay or otherwise.
 Brief facts of the controversy between the parties is that the Applicant was originally granted a total area of 16,564 acres for the purpose of coal mining under Pakistan Mining Concession Rules, 1960 now repealed by Sindh Mining Concession Rules, 2002 (""the Rules""). For reasons which find mention in the order of the Appellate Court, an area of 8,622 acres was resumed by the provincial government in the year 1996 on account of certain alleged violations leaving current area of 7,942-61 acres to the disposal of the Applicant. The concession granted to the current area, given in parcels, are attached between pages 96 to 106, one of such a notification was issued for the grant of an area dated 03.05.1993 for 3,533 acres in the northern block in terms of which an assignment/transfer in favour of the Applicant was made for the period of 30 years from the date of notification on the terms and conditions laid down in a notification dated 08.04.1985. It is interesting to observe that the said vital document of 1985 has not been produced by the Applicant. Be that as it may, even in the absence of the same, the skeleton conditions attached with the said assignment/transfer of land in favour of the Applicant reproduced at the bottom reverse of the said notification are vital and I reproduce them in the following.
(a)
 Applicant to abide by all the liabilities of the lease in question.
(b)
 Applicant will execute lease deed in terms of Rule 21 of Pakistan Mining Concession Rules, 1960.
(c)
 Applicant will furnish monthly production/dispatch return by the 7th of each month regularly, in case there is no production during the particular month, a 'Nil' report may be submitted in this respect.
(d)
 Applicant will submit regularly on quarterly basis the reports of progress with regard to the mining work carried out by them in the area.
(e)
 Applicant will return one copy of the attached plan duly accepted.
 Per counsel for Applicant, when these leases after enjoying their life of 30 years came to an end, the Applicant made an application attached at page 107 seeking renewal of these leases on 26.3.2012. Upon having been received the said application through a letter issued on 8th September, 2014 the Directorate of Coal Mines Energy Department, Government of Sindh replied as under:-
""I am directed to refer to your letter dated 15.03.2014 regarding renewal of coal mining leases and to say that before your request for renewal of coal mining case(s) is placed in the next meeting. of Coal Mines Committee following information be provided.
(a)
 Copies of Lease Deed(s) executed in the name of LCDC.
(b)
 Copy of notification authorizing the LCDC to sell the coal in open market.
(c)
 Consolidated production report/statement for last five years.
(d)
 Consolidated year wise statement of coal supplied to Lakhra Coal Power plant for last five years.""
 Certain information were provided by the Applicant in response to the said demand, however, as per record and as admitted by the learned counsel for the Applicant, LCDC failed to produce the lease deeds mandated in terms of Rule 21 of 1960 Rules which the Applicant was to enter into (within three months of the date) of notification assigning/transferring land in favour of the Applicant, as well as no document was shown to satisfy that the Applicants were granted permission to sell coal in the open market. It is pertinent to mention that under Rule 21 of the 1960 Rules, if a license or lease is not executed within three months of the communication of the approval of the application, the right of the Applicant to such a license or lease lapse. The court was informed that the sole purpose of having coal mined was to supply it to the WAPDA Coal Power Generation facility available at Lakhra. Court's attention was also drawn to the impugned letter dated 14.1.2015 attached at page 409 in terms of which the request for renewal of lease for further 30 years was declined for the reasons given in paragraph 3 of the said letter, which are reproduced hereunder:-
""Subsequently, the matter was placed before the Coal Mines Committee in its meeting held on 15.09.2014, the Committee observed gross violations of terms and conditions of mining leases and Sindh Mining Concession Rules, 2002 by the LCDC such as (i) Non-execution of Lease Deed(s) (ii) unauthorized sale of coal in open market and (iii) Non commissioning of mechanized mine operation.""
 The said decision of Coal Mines Committee was communicated by the Secretary, Energy Department, Government of Sindh. Also of relevance and reproduced is the last paragraph of the impugned letter as hereunder:-
""Keeping in view the facts, the coal mining leases earlier assigned/transferred/granted to M/s. Lakhra Coal Development Company Limited vide Notification No. DMD/S/ML-COAL(65)91/1717 dated 15.02.1996 covering an area of 7.942.61 acres at Lakhra Coal Field cannot be renewed further. Hence the said leases are liable to be treated as expired/ cancelled.""
 Having his application for extension of the terms of lease declined, the Applicant preferred F.C. Suit No. 03 of 2015 where it sought injunctive orders against the operation of the said letter. In its order dated 20.8.2016, the learned Senior Civil Judge-II, Kotri declined the application filed under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. by a detailed order. Relevant paragraphs of the said order, in the interest of relevancy, are reproduced hereunder:-
10.
 I have given due consideration to the arguments of both the sides and have carefully thrashed out pleadings, the documents annexed therewith and case laws relied upon by the learned counsel for plaintiff with the valuable assistance of learned counsel for the parties. The principles governing the grant of injunction pending disposal of the suit are that the plaintiff is required to show prima facie case in his favour, balance of convenience, and irreparable loss.
11.
 All the three ingredients must co-exist in favour of the plaintiff in order to entitle him to grant of interim injunction. It is well settled law that in case where even one ingredient is missing no temporary injunction an at all be capable of being granted. Please see case reported as 1989 CLC 1813. Besides, the injunctive relief being a discretionary one, the plaintiff must show that he has come to court with clean hands. Cursory perusal of the record it shows that the plaintiff has claimed that lease(s) will expire in the year 1926 but the notifications in respect of transfer/ assigning of the lease(s) submitted by the plaintiff with his plaint are speaking volumes leaving behind no room for any doubt or ambiguity. There is no denial to the fact that initially the PMDC was lessee and periods of leases are given herein below which were subsequently transferred to the plaintiff vide notification dated 3.5.1993.
 Periods/ Schedule of leases
(1)
 25.04.1980 to 24.4.2010
 (2)
 25.04.1980 to 24.4.2010
(3)
 17.01.1981 to 13.01.2011
 (4)
 06.04.1983 to 05.04.2013
(5)
 14.01.1981 to 13.01.2011
 (6)
 06.04.1983 to 05.04.2013
The above reproduced periods show that the leases expired in the year 2013. Interestingly the on the one hand the plaintiff has claimed that the leases will expire in the year 2026 but it has applied for renewal of the leases vides it letter dated 26.03.2012 which negates the claim of the plaintiff.
12.
 Moreover the plaintiff (LCDC) was setup in the year 1990, and it is claiming the alleged amount spent by PMDC, WAPDA in the years 1975 to 1986. It is worth to add here that he PMDC and WAPDA are separate entities and they spent the alleged amount in their independent capacity even a decade ago prior to setting up the plaintiff company, but they did not put any such claim despite of lapse of about thirty years. The plaintiff too has belatedly put forward demand of its alleged expenditure on account of feasibility study of mechanized mines, hence law of limitation, laches is prima facie a hurdle in the way of the plaintiff. There is no denial to the fact that the plaintiff failed to establish mechanized or semi-mechanized mines. The plaintiff/ lessee was not allowed to sell the coal of leased mines area in open market and it was duty bound to supply the coal only to the WAPDA but contrarily the plaintiff is selling the coal in open market in contravention of the terms and conditions of the lease(s). Rather the record/reports of the plaintiff shows that more major share of coal was sold out in open market and a small quantity was supplied to WAPDA, which results in load shedding/power shortage and heavy loss to the state lands/ minerals/natural resources of the Province.
13.
 Tentative assessment of the record reveals that the application of he plaintiff for renewal of the lease(s) was declined by the Coal mines committee (constituted under Sindh Mining Concession Rules, 2002) in its meeting dated 15.09.2014. The committee observed gross violations of terms and conditions of mining lease and the Rules by the plaintiff /lessee. The committee held that the plaintiff failed to execute lease deed(s), unauthorized sale of the coal in open market, and non-accomplishment of mechanized mines. In my humble view the defendant (GoS) / lessor is not bound renew the lease(s) and the record furnished by the plaintiff is self-contradictory. The plaintiff vide its reports and letters has admitted its failure to abide by the terms and conditions and has given some excuses in this regard which does not appeal to a prudent mind. Per plaintiff lease deed(s) are missing due to shifting. The plaintiff was bound to execute lease deeds within three months of the issue of mining lease notification. The plaintiff claimed that it was authorized by the lessor to sell out the excess coal in open market but it failed to produce any such authorization before the coal mines committee as well this court. The plaintiff Board of Directors unilaterally decided to sell out the coal in open market without the sanction, approval of the lessor. The plaintiff also failed to furnish periodical reports since 2009. Rather the plaintiff is holding the suit lands despite of the expiry of the lease period of 30 years which is causing heavy loss to the province and power sector. Reliance is placed upon case reported as 2002 SCMR 2002(S.C.)(sic)
14.
15.
 Moreover the plaintiff has filed this for declaration, injunction and compensation after about 20 years of the action of resuming of 8622 Acres which was allotted to M/s. Smith and after about two years of the dismissal of its application for renewal lease(s) hence in my humble view limitation and laches is also a hurdle in the way of the plaintiff. Moreover, relationship between parties was governed by mining lease and Sindh Mining Concession Rules, 2002, previously Pakistan Mining Concession Rules, 1960, being a special laws applicable thereto, Contract Act, 1872 and Specific Relief Act, 1877 would not apply to such lease(s) contracts. Besides the plaintiff himself had translated his grievance and loss in pecuniary terms through alternative relief of damages/compensation in suit. In my humble view the plaintiff has alternate remedy to demand compensation in terms of money as per his own demand hence the plaintiff fails to make out a case for grant of temporary injunctions. My views are fortified with case reported as 2009 YLR 2319 (Lahore).
16.
 Now coming to the claim of the plaintiff, as argued by Mr. Hakro, that in case the supply of coal to WAPDA stopped it will cause great inconvenience for the people/manpower and load shedding in surrounding areas like Jamshoro and Hyderabad. In this regard the tender notice dated 23.01.2013 of the WAPDA's power plant (LPGCL) is on record which shows that the WAPDA is also purchasing the coal from open market thus it is obvious that the plaintiff and WAPDA will not suffer any irreparable loss in case of refusal of the injunction. Moreover, the plaintiff should not worry regarding the load shedding because it is the responsibility of the WAPDA, who is running the Lakhra Power Plant. If the injunction be granted the defendant will suffer irreparable loss as the plaintiff is continuously carrying on coal mining despite of expiry of the 30 years lease(s) period, admittedly it is selling coal in the open market which is causing heavy loss to state natural resources/coal of the province.
 Against this order, an appeal was preferred where the Appellate Court of 1st Additional District Judge, Kotri passed a judgment dated 21.10.2016 wherein the Appellate court failed to find out any illegality or material irregularity in the orders of the trial court and accordingly dismissed the Applicant's appeal. Against these concurrent findings, the present Revision Application has been preferred.
 Learned counsel for applicant forcefully contended that the impugned letter dated 14.01.2015 has been issued in violation of Rule 59(2)(a) of Sindh Mining Concession Rules, 2002, where a mechanism has been provided that before cancelling a title under sub-rule (1) on a ground referred to in that sub-rule, the licensing authority is required to issue a notice in writing giving no less than 30 days time of its intention to cancel the title on the ground detailed in sub-rule (1), as well as, to specify the date before which the holder of the title was to submit a reply providing the ground on which he wishes the licensing authority to not to cancel the lease and thereafter the procedure provided under the latter part of this rule, the licensing authority could give a notice in writing cancelling the title. Learned counsel as stated earlier, vehemently argued that the aforementioned procedure has not been followed before the above mentioned order dated 14.01.2015 was passed. When posed with the question that the case in hand is not about the cancellation of mineral title rather is about renewal of the mineral title after its expiry. Provisions of Rule 48 were brought to the Court's attention, which I take the liberty to reproduce in the following:-
48.
 Duration of Mining Lease-(1) Subject to these Rules, a mining lease
(a)
 shall be valid for such period not exceeding thirty years extend-able for further period as determined by the licensing authority;
(3)
 Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-rule (1), but subject to these rules, where an application is made for the renewal of a mining lease, the lease shall not expire until the application is refused, withdrawn, granted or lapses, whichever first occurs.""
 By referring to the above mentioned provision of the Rules, 2002, learned counsel contended that the said Rule gives the Applicant lessee first right of renewal and that right could not have been taken away unless the mechanism provided under Rule 59 was followed. At the latter part of his arguments, learned counsel made reference to Rule 71 which provides the forum of appeal. The counsel contended that the impugned notice has been directly issued by the Secretary, Energy Department, Government of Sindh who was not the licensing authority, and by directly issuing the said notice, the Applicant has been deprived of an opportunity of appeal which lies against every order of the licensing authority to the Secretary Mines and Mineral Department. Learned counsel at the last leg of his arguments placed reliance on Sections 105, 106, 107 and 113 of Transfer of Property Act, 1882 and contended that LCDC being granted lease was required under section 113 to be served a notice before its lease was terminated.
 Learned Assistant Advocate General, appearing on behalf of respondents forcefully submitted that the case in hand is not about the cancellation of lease rather it is for the mechanism to be followed upon expiry of a lease, therefore, the Rule 59 referred by the learned counsel for Applicants is not applicable. He referred to page 55 of the trial court's order and by reading first paragraph thereof submitted that the Applicants are picking dual stands as at one hand, they have contended that the lease expired in 2013 while on the other hand they say that they are in possession of lease that will expire in 2026. Learned A.A.G. in his arguments supported the two orders passed by the court's below and submitted that they are speaking orders and there is no material irregularity therein, hence the instant Revision Application made under Section 115, C.P.C. being meritless be dismissed.
 Learned counsel for applicant in rebuttal assisted the court to the question as to how 2002 Rules are applicable where the lease in question was granted through 1960 Rules. By placing reliance on Rules 116 and 117 of 2002 Rules, learned counsel put forward the case that through those repealing provisions, all the leases granted under 1960 Rules are required to be dealt with by the present 2002 Rules, therefore, his earlier contention about that the cancellation of Appellant's lease in violation of Rule 56 being nullity in the eyes of law has been allegedly established, therefore, the said letter should be held as of no consequences or least to say that since LCDC is in possession of the said 7,942.61 acres of land, it should not be dispossessed in the interim period till the trial court comes to a final conclusion.
 Heard the counsel, learned Asstt: A.G. and reviewed the material available on record.
 A simple reading of the impugned letter suggests that it was the meeting of the Coal Mine Committee as desired under Rule 71 of the 2002 Rules which on 15.09.2014 assigned two fundamental reasons for refusing to renew the earlier leases granted to the Applicant. At one hand it is mentioned that the Appellant has committed gross violations of terms and conditions of mining leases by (i) Non-execution of Lease Deeds (ii) unauthorized sale of coal in open market and (iii) Non-commissioning of mechanized mine operation, and on the other hand it was also observed that the Appellant has failed to follow 2002 Rules. Keeping this view, the decision of Coal Mines Committee of rejecting the request of the Applicant for the extension of the term of lease was communicated through the Secretary Energy Department.
 Before this court, the fundamental question is to study mandatory requirements of the notifications in terms of which parts and parcels of land were assigned/ transferred to the Applicant being subject to the terms and conditions of notification of the year 1985, contents of which have not been shown to this Court and in these circumstances, I am at loss to judge the very compliance of the terms of the said notification. Be that as it may, in the absence of 1985 terms, the conditions reproduced in the land assignment / transfer notifications could be considered least to say. Of which probably the most important is that the said notification only assigned / transferred parts and parcels of the land in favour of the Applicant and within three months of the date of these notifications, the Applicants were required to enter into a lease with the lessee specifying the terms and conditions which were to be adhered by the lessee LCDC. Neither before the trial court nor before the Appellate court, or nor before this Court those lease documents have been produced. In the absence thereof as rightly contended by the learned A.A.G. a view could be taken that those leases were never entered into. Even for the sake of arguments, Court by giving benefit of doubt to the Applicant, could take inverse view by holding that those leases were entered into but there is no cavil to the fact that the term of those leases was 30 years which expired in the year 2013. Focusing my attention to the acts done after 2013, when an application for renewal of leases was made by the Applicant, the documents submitted to the court clearly shows that certain critical questions were posed to the Applicant to satisfy the authority that whether it has complied with the terms and conditions of the lease, amongst which the key question was whether in fact the leases were ever entered into and was any permission ever granted to the Applicant for the sale of coal in open market, and did the applicant failed in brining on the site mechanized mine equipments, being three grounds taken in the impugned letter for refusing to renew LCDC's earlier leases. It is worth mentioning that no arguments are put forward in denial of these three allegations. Astonishingly it is not denied that coal was not sold in the open market. It is a matter of fact that mechanized equipments were not brought and in the absence of lease deeds, Court could easily come to a conclusion that leases were never entered into. This rightly propels the court for the examination of provisions of Rule 48 rather to focus on Rule 59. Once again, in the absence of any lease deed, if for the sake of arguments it is admitted that leases were entered into and during their term of 30 years those lease terms were not violated, still there is no first right of renewal of lease in favour of lessee. It is worth considering that Rule 48 creates possibility for extension of the term of lease, however, state granted leases are always subject to the terms that lessor has the right of cancellation of lease in accordance with law and at the time of renewal, to use its discretion to not to renew the lease. The case at hands fall under sub-rule (2) of Rule 48 where if a request is made for extension of lease, the same request could be well refused, withdrawn or granted by the authority in question. In the given circumstances, the arguments that the lease was improperly cancelled in violation of Rule 59 does not hold any water as in the case at hand LCDC made application for extension of lease and under Rule 48, the authority rests with the Provincial Government to refuse, withdraw or grant extensions. The case in hand is marred by the alleged violations wherefrom conduct of the applicant is exposed not only with regard to having failed to enter into proper leases alone, rather selling the coal to open market when coal was to be provided to WAPDA for power generation to an energy starved nation, therefore, neither on merits, prima facie right , balance of convenience or on the anticipated exposure to irreparable loss, I see any merit in the instant Revision Application as no grounds are present before me to differ from the findings rendered by the trial court or those which were cemented at the appellate level. Neither any ground is made under section 115, C.P.C. for the intervention of this court in the concurrent findings of courts below. I accordingly dismiss this Revision Application along with its all pending applications.

 MUHAMMAD NADEEM QURESHI, MEMBER (JUDICIAL-I).--
Through this order, I intend to dispose off Appeal No. K-178/2016 directed against the Order-in-Original No.451106 dated 03.12.2015 passed by Additional Collector of Customs, Adjudication-I, Customs House, Karachi (here-in-after to be referred as respondent No. 2)
2.
 Briefly facts are that the appellant imported a consignment comprising of (i) 60 kgs Pnomatic Marking Machine (ii) 13712 Crank Casing Left & (iii) 9936 kgs Crank Casing Right Chong Qing Jeson Power Machinery Co., Ltd, China @ US$. 100/pc & US$. 3.60/kg i.e. US$. 71639.20 C&F Karachi vide invoice No. JP150601 dated 07.07.2015 & B/L No. 00LU2562602970 dated 08.07.2015. The appellant upon receipt of import documents, transmitted the Goods Declaration (hereinafter to be referred as GD) to the MCC of Appraisement (West) under Section 79(1) of the Customs Act, 1969 (hereinafter to be referred as Act) and Rule 433 of Sub-Chapter III of Chapter XXI of Customs Rules, 2001(hereinafter to be referred as Rules) and as per a pre-condition for availing the regime of WeBOC, deposited upfront duty and taxes of Rs.6,863,275.00 in National Bank of Pakistan, consequent to which his GD was allotted number: KAPW-HC-6604 dated 14.10.2015. Upon appearance of the GD on his desktop, the nominated Assessing Officer instead of completing the assessment on the basis of the declaration and scanned documents, opted to get the goods examined first under the provision of Section 198 and Rule 435 of the Act/Rules and to proceed with adduced his opinion and referred the GD to the Deputy Collector, Group-VII, MCC of Appraisement (West), Karachi (hereinafter to be referred as Respondent No. 1), who gave his assent and transmitted the GD to the Terminal, where the posted Officials of MCC of Appraisement (West), verified the declaration to the extent of description, quality and weight with the exception of value for which intimation was made that an invoice of US$. 77,054.00 has been found, which is excess by US$. 5,415/- which is equivalent to US$. 7.55% to the declared value. The assessing officer upon appearance of report on his desktop, completed the assessment through a valid assessment order in terms of Section 80 and Rule 438 of the Act/Rules at US$. 100,008.10 as against retrieved invoice of US$. 77,054.00 for levy of additional amount of duty and taxes of Rs. 2,984,453.00. in addition to paid upfront Rs. 6,863,275.00, totaling to Rs. 9,847,728.00. Despite of the said fact, the assessing officer framed contravention report with the allegation of misdeclaration of value, attracting the provision of sections 32(1), (A) and 79(1) of the Act. Section 3(1) of the Imports and Exports (Control ) Act, 1950, section 33 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 and Section 148 of the Income Tax Ordinance, punishable under clauses (1) and (14) of Section 156(1) of the Act to be read with S.R.O. 499(I)/2009 dated 13.06.2009 and transmitted that to respondent No. 1, who after approving that referred that to Additional Collector, Law, who after agreeing to the opinion formed by respondent No. 1 and his subordinate transmitted that to respondent No. 2, who transmitted show-cause notice dated 19.10.2015 based on narrated fact and invoked provision of the Act/Ordinance, in the Contravention Report. The appellant submitted reply to the show-cause notice through which he informed him that in the case of the appellant assessment has to be made with the application of Valuation Ruling No. 685/2014 dated 15.09.2014, as per which the value comes to US$. 100,008.10 higher by US$. 22,954.10, which is 29.79% of the retrieved invoice, the respondent No. 2 was further informed that charge of misdeclaration of value could only be leveled on the basis of direct evidence (evidential invoice) of the same country of the period expressed in Rule 107(a) of Chapter IX of Rules and if the difference between declared and the evidential invoice is more than 30% as ordered by the Board in para 101 of CGO 12/2002 dated 15.06.2002 and clause (d) of 499(I)/2009 dated 13.06.2009, as against difference of 7.55% as reported in examination report/show-cause notice. In the narrated circumstances neither contravention report nor show-cause notice was warranted under law, therefore, same may please be vacated. The respondent No. 2 ignored the submission and the direction of the Board and passed order dated 03.01.2015, beyond the charter of show-cause notice and held the charges of mis-declaring of UOM, which is kg as against declared unit for avoiding application of valuation ruling. With this he held the charges as leveled in the show-cause notice as established and ordered confiscation of the goods subject to redemption of those upon payment of 20% fine, imposed penalty of Rs. 100,000.00, in addition to leviable duty and taxes. Paras 2 and 3 are relevant and are reproduced here-in-under:--
""I have gone through the case record and considered written/verbal arguments of the respondent and the department. The respondent imported the under reference consignment by declaring the goods as (i) New Pneumatic Marketing Machine W/Std Accessories under PCT heading 8479.82290 (ii) Crank Casing Left CG Spare Parts for Motorcycle under PCT heading 8483.1012 (iii) Crank Casing Right CG Spare Parts for Motorcycle under PCT Heading 8483.1012 at a declared invoice value of US$. 71,639.00 and sought clearance under self-assessment system. It has been alleged by the department that during the course of examination a higher value invoice of US$. 77,054.00 was found as against declared invoice value of US$. 71,639.20/ and sought clearance under self assessment system. It has been alleged by the department that during the course of examination a higher value invoice of US$. 77,054.00 was found against declared invoice value of US$. 71,639.20/-. The difference between declared invoice and found invoice is US$. 5,414.80/-. The availability of invoice with the imported goods is also otherwise mandatory as prescribed vide Rule 389 of the Customs Rules, 2001 notified vide SRO 450(I)/2001 dated 18.06.2001. It is observed that the invoice found from the container is 7.55% higher only and the department has assessed the goods in accordance with the values determined under Valuation Ruling No. 685/2014 dated 15.09.2014 @ US$. 3.95/kg i.e. US$. 99,848.10. Therefore, the value mentioned in the found invoice cannot be treated as Transaction Value. The found invoice has no consequential effects on customs duty and taxes as assessed by the department.
3. Scrutiny of record, further revealed that the importer declared Crank Casing Right/Left CG Spare Parts for Motorcycle, quantity 19872 pcs of unit price US$. 3.60/Pc. The respondent declared total value of parts as US$. 71,539.20. it is pertinent to mention that as per Pakistan Customs Tariff the unit of measurement for under reference parts is Kg. The department assessed the value of parts by applying Valuation Ruling No. 685/2014 dated 15.09.2014 @ US$. 3.95/kg, which comes to US$. 99,848.10. There is a substantial difference between the declared value and assessed value of US$. 2,8308.90. It is evident that the respondent has deliberately concealed and filed untrue declaration on the basis of Nos. instead of kg to get the goods released on suppressed value to evade legitimate amount of customs duty and taxes. Hence, the offence of untrue declaration/misdeclaration stands established. I therefore, order for confiscation of offending goods under section 156(1) clause 14, read with section 32(1)(2) and 79(1) of the Customs Act, 1969. However, an option under Section 181 of the Customs Act, 1969 is given to the importer to redeem the confiscated goods on payment of 20% redemption fine Rs. 596,525/- (Rupees five hundred ninety six thousand five hundred and twenty five ) in terms of S.R.O. 499(I)/2009 dated 13.06.2009 (of the value of offending goods) in addition to payment of duty and taxes chargeable thereon I impose a penalty of Rs.100,000.00 (Rupees one hundred) on the importer for violation of above mentioned provision of law.
3.
 The appellant filed the appeal on the basis of grounds enumerated therein. No cross objection under subsection (4) of section 194A has been filed within the stipulated period of 30 days by the respondent No. 1, instead the representative of the respondent made submission at Bar that the order passed by the respondent No. 2 is correct in fact and law be maintained while ignoring the technicalities, legal deficiencies/lacuna, etc, referred by the appellant in the grounds of appeal. 
4.
 Rival parties heard and case record perused in addition with the relied upon citations. I am indebted to inscribe that show-cause notice is a vital basic document, which should be prepared with utmost care after going through the provision of the Acts/Ordinance, cosmetic show-cause notice is never been considered a legal document and for that reason the FBR and Superior Judicial Fora through direction/instruction issued from time to time or reported judgments made mandated for the show-cause issuing authority to carefully go through the facts of the case and applicable provision of the Act alleged to be contravened and so the penal clauses so attracted for penalizing after establishing of the charges. Decision on any fresh ground, which was not spelled out in the show-cause notice is not permitted. Similarly, any provisions of the Act/Ordinance, which are not applicable and were invoked or irrelevant Sections are invoked, renders the show-cause notice palpably illegal. Judgment of High Court of Sindh reported at 2004 PTD 369 in the case of Messrs Zeb Traders v. Federation of Pakistan is relevant, wherein, it has been held that ""The proceeding before Adjudicating Officer, under the Customs Act, 1969 are in the nature of quasi judicial proceedings and issuance of notice under section 180 of the Customs Act, is very important documents. The decision to issue show-cause notice is to be taken by the Collector, Adjudication, by application of independent mind and not merely signing the draft show-cause notice submitted by the investigation agency separate from the Adjudication Department and each category of officers are required to perform their respective functions/ duties under the law. The practice to submit draft show-cause notice by the Director General of Intelligence and Investigation to the Collector Adjudication is depreciated."" Upon examination of the show-cause notice, it has been observed that the respondent No. 2 transmitted the show-cause notice to the appellant, draft of which was received by him from respondent No. 1 without going through its contents containing Sections of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 and Income Tax Ordinance, 2001. This lapse on his part bears serious consequences, because Sections 33 and 34 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 and Section 148 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, which were referred/invoked in the show-cause notice are not relevant by virtue of the fact that Section 33 contains penal clauses akin to Section 156(1) of the Act and Section 33 speaks about imposing of default surcharge, meaning thereby that these are machinery sections. Similarly, Section 148 of the Income Tax Ordinance also contains the procedure for collection of Income Tax at import stage by the authorities referred therein. Meaning thereby that these are independent Sections and have no nexus with the charging/relevant section 11 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 and Section 162(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, under which show-cause notice could had to be issued by the Officer of Inland Revenue/Commissioner not by the Officer of Customs, who have to remain within the ambit of Act, they are either not empowered to invoke the Sections of either Sales Tax Act, 1990 or Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 under any circumstances. Issuance of show-cause notice on the basis of irrelevant sections under which officers of customs are not empowered. Renders it void and ab-initio and of no legal effect as held in reported judgments Asst. Collector v. Khyber Elec. Lamps 2003 PTD 1275, D.G. Khan Cement v. Collector of Customs 2005 PTD 480, Caltex v. Collector 2003 PTD 1593, Union Playing Card Company v. Collector of Customs 2002 MLD 130, Atlas Tyres v. Addl. Collector 2002 MLD 180, State Cement v. Collector PTCL 2001 CL 558, Kashmir Sugar v. Collector 1992 SCMR 1898, Rose Color v. Chairman, CBR and 2013 PTD 813 Sarwar International v. Addl. Collector of Customs. 
5.
 While passing Order-in-Original/Appeal, it is mandated upon the Adjudicating Authority to examine the charter of show-cause notice and remain within its ambit. In case order so passed is beyond the charter of the show-cause notice, it is deems to be illegal and the Appellate Tribunal is left with no other option except to declare it suffering from legal infirmity and as such void. While perusing order passed by Respondent No. 2. I have noted with concern that he has made reference to the misdeclaration of UOM. This narration/ground is not available in the show-cause notice and confirms that the order has been passed beyond the charter of show-cause notice. Such type of the order is always declared being passed without any lawful authority. Reference is placed on reported judgments at Collector Excise and Land Customs and others v. Rehm Din reported at 1987 SCMR 1840 and Adam v. Collector of Customs, Karachi PLD 1969 Supreme Court 446, Muhammad Sadqain v. Collector of Customs (Appraisement) 2006 PTD 2742 and Messrs Exide Pakistan Ltd. v. Deputy Collector of Customs (Adjudication-III), Karachi, 2004 PTD 1449, ""wherein it has been held that Order of adjudication, being ultimately based on a ground which was not mentioned in the show-cause notice is palpably illegal on the face of it"". 
6.
 Before parting with the judgment, it is of paramount importance to subscribe that where any assessment of the imported goods for levy of duty and taxes is being made with the application of valuation ruling issued by Director, Directorate General of Valuation under the provision of Section 25A of the Act, retrieved invoice whether of higher or lower value as against declared, is of no significance by virtue of the fact that the retrieved invoice is of no significance, even if it is transaction value within the meaning of Section 25(1) of the Act because ""Custom value"" as determined under Section 25A with the application of different sub Section of Section 25 of the Act in sequential manner. Notwithstanding, the retrieved invoice ought not have to be considered as declaration within the meaning of 2(kka) of the Act. Even otherwise, charge of misdeclaration of value has to be invoked on the basis of direct evidence (evidential invoice as ordered in paras 78 and 101 of CGO 12/2002 dated 15.06.2002 and clause (d) of S.R.O. 499(I)/2009 dated 13.06.2009 and the difference between declared value and value of evidential invoice is more than 30%. In the instant case the difference of said to be value of retrieved invoice with the declared invoice is 7.55%, whereas assessment was made at US$. 100008.10 i.e. higher by US$. 29954.10 arrived, while applying valuation ruling No. 685/2014 dated 15.09.2014, on which exchequer collected duty and taxes of Rs. 2,984,453.00 as against alleged to be collected on US$.5,415.00. In the given circumstances of the case no occasion was available either for respondent No. 1 to frame contravention report nor with the respondent No. 2 to issue show-cause notice and pass order-in-original simply for penalizing the appellant in the absence of fault or default and in derogation of the provision of Sections 2(kka), 25, 25A and 32 of the Act. Therefore, I have reached to the irresistible conclusion that the entire proceeding right from framing of contravention report till issuance of order is based on mala fide and caprice, hence of no legal effect and jurisdiction and as such ab initio void. 
7.
 What has been discussed hereinabove, particularly the interpretation of law, legal propositions and observations made thereon and to follow the ratio decidendi observed by the Superior Courts, I hereby vacate the impugned show-cause notice, and set aside the order passed thereon, during the hierarchy of the customs being illegal, void ab-initio, appeal is accordingly allowed with no order as to cost.

 IJAZ ANWAR, J.---
Through this single judgment, we intend to dispose of this and the connected Writ Petitions Nos. 759-P and 761-P of 2017 involving common question of law and fact. The common relief that has been sought in this and the connected writ petitions are that:--
""I)
 The impugned act of the Respondent No.4 for conducting forcible raid on the premises of the petitioner and taking into custody Computer, records and other valuable documents etc without any notice and without any receipt in the garb of section 175 of the Income Tax Ordinance is illegal, unconstitutional, wrong, unauthorized, based on high handedness and thus liable to be declared as such.
II)
 That the Respondent No. 4 are bound to at once return all the Paraphernalia so illegally taken into custody from the premises of the petitioner so that the petitioner may run his business without any undue fear and the Respondent be refrained from taking any action against the petitioner in similar fashion in perpetuity.
III)
 That the Respondents are not authorized to proceed against the petitioner in any manner on the basis of impugned acts as the elements of fabrication and manipulation on the behest of the rivals of the petitioner is very much present and existing any such act of the Respondent is without lawful authority, ultra vires of the Constitution and thus of no legal effect.
IV)
 The respondents may perpetually be restrained from proceedings adversely against the petitioners till the writ petition so filed by the petitioner is decided by an independent Court of competent jurisdiction and stay may kindly be granted"".
2.
 The facts narrated in this case are that the petitioner is a private limited company duly incorporated under the Companies Ordinance, 1984 and engaged in the business of outdoor furniture and sanitary Pipes and fittings. The petitioner has been duly authorized by the Board of Director to file this petition. It is alleged that despite all the non-conducive atmosphere in this part of the country for the Industrialists, the petitioner and its sister concerns are contributing sizably towards the economy of this Province. It is alleged that the petitioner remained very clear and open towards its liability towards tax authorities and submitted Income Tax Returns in times and no return was however objected by the Income Tax Department. It is alleged that one Hafeez-ur-Rehman an Ex-employee having personal grudge with the petitioner, conveyed wrong information to the respondents which resulted into the illegal and highly agonizing raid by the respondents on 17.2.2017 at the headquarters office of the petitioner and its sister concerns without notice or any prior information. It is alleged that without their being any legal warrant from the Court of law, the respondents forcibly entered into the premises of Head Office and forcibly snatched and took into possession the valuable documents, records and computers of the petitioner. It is alleged that while seizing these documents and computers no receipt was ever provided. The petitioner when approached the respondent No.4 and complained about the illegal activities, was handed over the fabricated notice of inquiry dated 17.2.2017 allegedly issued under section 175 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 and refused to return the documents and computers impounded illegally.
3.
 The respondents were put to notice and directed to file their comments. The respondents Nos.4 and 5 have accordingly filed their comments, wherein they denied the allegations leveled by the petitioner. They summarized their defence in paras 6 and 7 of the comments, besides objecting on the jurisdiction of this Court.
4.
 Paras. 6 and 7 of the comments are reproduced for ready reference:--
""That the contents of the corresponding para are pathetically untrue, incorrect and whimsical. The purpose of such narration on the part of the petitioner is just to sensitize to matter.
The answering respondent conducted search of the business/ manufacturing premises of petitioner in accordance with the provisions of section 175 of Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 read with SRO 115(I)/2015 dated 09.02.2015. The visiting team went totally unarmed and entered the premises of petitioner with permission and in a peaceful manner. The petitioner themselves not only provided free access to their business/manufacturing premises but also handed over the requisite record to the answering respondents visiting team. During the course of search, the authorized officers examined certain record/ documents and computers which were taken into custody for the purpose of detailed examination and further investigation under the law.
Here it is pertinent to mention that the petitioner is not a law abiding citizen, as after taking custody of the record, as the answering respondent team was about to leave, the petitioner's armed men stopped the answering respondent and put them in illegal confinement. The respondents' officials were not allowed to leave the premises. So much so that eventually when the respondent No. 4 came to know about the illegal confinement of his officials, the same sought the help of the area Police to rescue his officials from the garb of petitioners' armed perssonels. Later on FIR was also lodged against the petitioner. Copy of the FIR is hereby enclosed"".

 The learned counsel for the respondents at the very outset raised preliminary objection regarding the maintainability of this constitutional petition on the ground that the survey/search of the premises was conducted by the authorized officer while exercising the powers under section 175 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, therefore, under section 122 of the Income Tax Ordinance, the petitioner has his remedy by submission of the case as a taxpayer and in case aggrieved there from to avail remedies provided under that fora.
6.
 In response, learned counsel for the petitioner formulated his arguments and argued that impounding the computers and other record of the petitioner and by the respondents allegedly exercising their power under section 175 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 that evidence can be used against the petitioner under section 216(3)(g) for the purpose of Sales Tax, Federal Excise Tax and Customs Tax, etc therefore, the search as required under section 40 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 was mandatory and having not been conducted in accordance with law, has no legal sanctity. Similarly, the raid of the premises without such search warrant as prescribed under the law would be illegal and where the respondents have not conducted themselves in accordance with law, the writ petition would be competent.
7.
 Learned counsel for the petitioner argued that section 175 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 is para-materia to section 38 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990, therefore, while conducting such search, the procedure prescribed under section 40 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 would be applicable, wherein the relevant provisions of Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 relating to search was made applicable. Learned counsel for the petitioner relied upon 2014 SCMR 30 to contend that such type of raids without notice and without the prior permission from the Magistrate was declared as illegal. Learned counsel also referred to an un-reported judgment of the Apex Court in C.P. No. 1534 of 2016 titled ""Additional Director General of Intelligence and Investigation, Customs House, Peshawar v. Messrs Universal Plastic Industries"" dated 31.5.2016, wherein while making reference to sections 38 and 40 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990, the judgment of the Peshawar High Court striking down the raid as un-authorized was maintained and leave was refused. Learned counsel for the petitioner referred to sections 101,102, 103 read with section 165 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 and contended that any search of the premises without following the procedure prescribed under Cr.P.C. is illegal and was struck down in a number of judgments by the Superior Courts. He placed reliance on 2003 PTD 1034, 2007 PTD 2356, 2005 SCMR 1166, PLD 1991 SC-630, 1999 PCr.LJ 1546, 1997 SCMR-408, PLD 1996 SC-574, 2005 PTD 1200 and 2005 SCMR 37. He while specifically referring to the impugned order dated 17.2.2017 whereby access was sought to the premises and on the strength of that letter they forcibly entered the premises and after examination of some record subsequently impounded the record, documents and computers, the learned counsel for petitioner contended that it was not a final order, therefore, the provision of section 122 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 cannot be invoked. Similarly, the judgments which he referred and placed reliance also arisen out of constitutional petition decided by the High Courts and maintained by the Supreme Court of Pakistan. He contended that this Court can entertain the writ petition in the given circumstances.
8.
 The learned counsel for the respondents, however, while arguing the case on merits submitted that the Resumption memo duly prepared under section 175(1)(e) suggests that it was produced to the visiting team by the taxpayers themselves and no force as alleged was used or it can be termed as a raid. Learned counsel argued that it was purely a factual controversy and therefore, the same cannot be resolved in writ jurisdiction, besides availability of alternate remedy for him.
9.
 Learned counsel for the respondents referred to the notification dated 09.02.2015 and contended that certain officers were duly authorized under the law to enter for search as mentioned under section 175 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001. He further argued that the petitioner are bound to allow free access to the Authorized Officer for the purpose of survey or making of Audit of the Taxpayers, therefore, there is no occasion for the petitioner to have invoked the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court and request for the dismissal of the writ petition.
10.
 Arguments heard and record perused.
11.
 The record shows that the petitioner was issued a notice of enquiry under section 175 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, scheduled for 17/2/2017. A team was constituted to verify the facts which they received after certain credible information/enquiry about undeclared bank account and suppression of sales. This visit pursuant to the notice has been termed by the petitioner as raid, use of force in impounding certain record/documents and computers.
12.
 The point of law for the determination of this Court as emerged from the arguments of the learned counsel for the parties is that whether the Commissioner or any Officer authorized, when given access to any premises can further impound any accounts, documents or computer desk etc without the permission of the taxpayer and then make inventory of such impounded material, without adopting the procedure prescribed under sections 101, 102, 103 read with section 165 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 and whether section 38 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 is para-materia to section 175 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 and if so the Authorized Officer is bound to follow the procedure as prescribed under section 40 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990. To find out the answers to these questions, we for the purpose of convenience reproduce section 175 of the Income Tax Act, 2001 as:--
175. Power to enter and search premises
.---(1) In order to enforce any provision of this Ordinance (including for the purpose of making an audit of a taxpayer or a survey of persons liable to tax), the Commissioner or any officer authorized in writing by the Commissioner for the purposes of this section
(a) shall, at all times and without prior notice, have full and free access to any premises, place, accounts, documents or computer;
(b) may stamp, or make an extract or copy of any accounts, documents or computer-stored information to which access is obtained under clause (a);
(c) may impound any accounts or documents and retain them for so long as may be necessary for examination or for the purposes of prosecution'
(d) may, where a hard copy or computer disk of information stored on a computer is not made available, impound and retain the computer for as long as is necessary to copy the information required; and
(e) may make an inventory of any articles found in any premises or place to which access is obtained under clause (a)
(2) The Commissioner may authorize any valuer or expert to enter any premises and perform any task assigned to him by the Commissioner]
(3) The occupier of any premises or place to which access is sought under subsection (1) shall provide all reasonable facilities and assistance for the effective exercise of the right of access.
(4) Any accounts, documents or computer impounded and retained under subsection (1) shall be signed for by the Commissioner or an authorized officer.
(5) A person whose accounts, documents or computer have been impounded and retained under subsection (1) may examine them and make extracts or copies from them during regular office hours under such supervision as the Commissioner may determine.
(6) Where any accounts, documents or computer impounded and retained under subsection (1) are lost or destroyed while in the possession of the Commissioner, the Commissioner shall make reasonable compensation to the owner of the accounts, documents or computer for the loss or destruction.
(7) This section shall have effect notwithstanding any rule of law relating to privilege or the public interest in relation to access to premises or places, or the production of accounts, documents or computer stored information.
(8) In this section, ""occupier"" in relation to any premises or place, means the owner, manager or any other responsible person on the premises or place"".
13.
 We have examined very carefully the arguments of learned counsel for the petitioner, when he argued that in section 175(a), specifically the powers to enter and have free access to any premises has been given only under section 175 (1)(a) but in the subsequent provisions where documents, computers can be impounded no such powers/ authority is conferred ""without prior notice"" is mentioned purposely by the legislation, therefore the learned counsel tried to deduce this law point that since these are stringent actions, therefore, they cannot be carried out without prior notice and search procedure as prescribed under the Cr.P.C., 1898.
14.
 We may observe here that the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 is a legislation later in time to the Sales Tax Act, 1990, therefore, if the intention of the legislation was to have considered the respective sections 38 of the Sale Tax and 175 of the Income Tax Ordinance as para-meteria then there was no need of giving numerous detail in section 175 of the Income Tax Ordinance. We found that section 175 is a self contained section and provided the actions step by step in section 175(1)(a) and thereafter. All these sub sections cannot be read disjunctively but be read conjunctively, because the actions i.e. taken by the Commissioner or Officers authorized follows one after the other. Section 175(1)(a) allow the Authorized Officer to have full and free access to any premises, place, accounts and documents or computer, subsection (b) then if required allow such officer to make an extract or copy of any accounts, documents, computer stored-information to which excess is obtained under clause (a). Now, if the authorized officer found that on examining the computer and the record/documents it is found that it required further examination or, there is suppression of some important facts about evasion in tax, he may impound any account or documents and retained them for so long as may be necessary for examination or for purpose of prosecution. Section 175 (1) sub-clause (e) further support this discussion, wherein an inventory of any article found in any premises is prepared. In this sub-clause (e) of section 175(1) again the words ""to which access is obtained under clause 1 clause (a)"" is used which is very important, because it dispels this arguments that inventory of such impounded materials can be made only when a proper procedure of search is carried out as required under the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898.
15.
 Subsection (7) of Section 175 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 gives this section an overriding effect on any other law/rules relating to privileges or the public interest in relation to access to premises for or places or the production of accounts, documents or computer stored-information. Thus, it excludes the impression of search warrant or search procedure as required under Criminal Procedure Code, 1898.
16.
 Similarly, the arguments that the action taken by the respondents under section 175 and the evidence procured can be used against the petitioner under section 216(3) clause (g) even in the matters of Sales Tax etc, therefore, the procedure prescribed under section 40 of the Sales Tax is required to be followed. We put this arguments to the respondents to respond, the representative of the respondents present in Court and their counsel have stated at the bar that the information that is obtained under section 175 of the Income Tax Ordinance shall not be used against the petitioner as prescribed under section 216(3)(g) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001. Be that as it may, the matter is still under inquiry as prescribed under section 175 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 and secondly where any such information that is obtained, and is used against the petitioner in the matter of Sales Tax etc that would be seen at its appropriate time.
17.
 We have also examined the case law referred by the learned counsel for the petitioner and found that the judgments relied upon are distinguishable, because only sections 38 and 40 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 read with sections 101, 102, 103 and 165 of the Cr.P.C. 1898, were discussed. None of the case referred have discussed the effect of section 175 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001.
18.
 It is also observed that where the search under section 175 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 has not been subjected to the search procedure as required under the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898, we cannot of our own import that procedure or the provisions contained in section 40 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 into section 175 Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 nor we can of our own alleges omission on the part of legislation in not mentioning. Rather we observe that it was with reasons because subsection (7) of section 175 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, was given an overriding effect over any rule or law relating to privileges or the public interest in relation to access to premises or places and searches, examination of record, impounding documents/computers that is carried out under the mandate of above subsections. Similarly, the law mandated the respondents to be given full and free access to the premises without prior notice and involving police for search was never the intention of legislation.
19.
 For the aforesaid reasons, we are thus clear in our mind that the action taken by the respondents cannot be termed as illegal, the respondents acted within the parameters set by section 175 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 and in no way can be termed as without jurisdiction.
20.
 This and the connected writ petitions are thus not maintainable and dismissed.

 MIRZA VIQAS RAUF, J.---
Shabbir Ahmed, the petitioner was married to respondent No.4 on 28th August, 2011 in accordance with The Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961. During the wedlock, minors namely Shahmir Ahmed (son) and Momina Bibi (daughter) were born. On account of some matrimonial disputes, a suit was instituted by respondent No.4 on her own behalf as well as on behalf of respondents Nos.5 and 6 for recovery of dower, gold ornaments and maintenance. The petitioner, being defendant, resisted the suit and submitted his written statement, controverting the assertions contained in the plaint. From the divergent pleadings of the parties, multiple issues were framed. After framing of necessary issues, both the parties to the suit produced their respective evidence and on completion of the same, suit was partially decreed by way of judgment dated 24th May, 2016. The said judgment and decree was assailed by both the sides through their respective appeals before the learned Additional District Judge, Attock. The appeals were consolidated and by way of consolidated judgment and decree dated 19th September, 2016, the appeal preferred by the petitioner was dismissed whereas appeal filed by the respondents Nos.4 to 6 (hereinafter referred as ""respondents"") was partially accepted, hence this petition.
2.
 Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that suit before the learned Judge Family Court was not proceedable as in the previous round, matter in issue was resolved by the Arbitration Council. He added that after the said decision, since no remedy was availed by the respondents as per Section 9 of The Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, so order had attained finality. Learned counsel contended that even otherwise, maintenance was awarded at an exorbitant rate and the evidence to this effect has been grossly misread by both the learned Courts below. Learned counsel contended that the impugned judgments are not tenable under the law and the jurisdiction has been illegally exercised.
3.
 Conversely, learned counsel for the respondents submitted that there is no illegality with the impugned judgments requiring interference by this Court in exercise of constitutional jurisdiction. He added that the matter in issue clearly falls within the domain of learned Family Court and the suit was competent. Learned counsel contended that there is no jurisdictional defect in the impugned judgment, thus instant petition merits dismissal.
4.
 After having heard learned counsels for both the sides at a considerable length, I have also perused the available record with their able assistance.
5.
 It is evident from the record that ""respondents"" instituted suit for multiple reliefs including the maintenance. In order to prove the claim agitated in the plaint, the respondent No.4 herself appeared as PW-1 and while tendering her affidavit as Exh.P1 reiterated her grievance. The Nikahnama was produced as Exh.P2 in addition to other documents. Conversely, the petitioner appeared as DW-1 and tendered his affidavit as Exh.D1. The learned judge Family Court, after having an appraisal of evidence, decreed the suit partially in the following manner:-
""15.
 In the light of my findings upon the above discussed issues, the suit of the plaintiffs is hereby partially decreed in their favour in the term that plaintiff No.1 is entitled to recover remaining dower amount Rs.50,000/-, 03-tolas gold ornaments as well as ""Iddat"" maintenance at the rate of Rs.5000/- per month total Rs.15,000/-. Minor plaintiffs Nos.2 and 3 are also entitled to recover monthly maintenance at the rate of Rs.3000/- each from 11.09.2014 till operation of law with 10% annual increase. At the same time, claim of plaintiff No.1 for recovery of maintenance from September 2014 to September, 2016 as well as one gold ring worth Rs.20,000/- are hereby dismissed. There is no order as to costs.""
6.
 Both the sides, being dissatisfied from the said judgment and decree, preferred their respective appeals before the learned Additional District Judge, Attock. The appeals were consolidated and by way of consolidated judgment and decree dated 19th September, 2016, the appeal preferred by the petitioner was dismissed whereas the appeal filed by the ""respondents"" was partially accepted and a slight modification was made to the following effect: 
""19.
 What has been discussed above, the appeal filed by Shabbir Ahmed titled 
Shabbir Ahmed v. Shahida Bibi
 is dismissed whereas the appeal filed by respondent Shahida Bibi is partially accepted as under:--
(1)
 Respondents Nos.2 and 3 the minors are declared entitled to get the maintenance at the rate of Rs.3500/- per month each from 11.09.2014, when the mother of the minor was divorced with 10 per cent per annum till their majority.
(2)
 Respondent No.1 is entitled to get the maintenance for milking her minor Shah Mir at the rate of Rs.1500/- per month for the period of two years.
(3)
 Respondent No.1's appeal to the extent of gold ring is dismissed.""
It is evident from the above that except slight change in the quantum of maintenance to the extent of minors and award of birth expenses to the respondent No.4 (mother), no other material change was introduced by way of impugned judgment and decree.
7.
 Before coming to the propriety of the impugned judgment, it would be relevant to observe that the main resistance to the impugned judgment by the petitioner rests upon the proceedings conducted by the Arbitration Council in terms of Section 9 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961. Learned counsel for the petitioner, to this effect, emphatically contended that after proceedings before the Arbitration Council, suit was not proceedable. In order to properly appreciate this question, it would be relevant to first examine the provision of Section 9 of The Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, which reads as under:--
Maintenance
.--- (1) If any husband fails to maintain his wife adequately or where there are more wives than one fails to maintain them equitably, the wife, or all or any of the wives may in addition to seeking any other legal remedy available, apply to the Chairman who shall constitute an Arbitration Council to determine the matter, and Arbitration Council may issue a certificate specifying the amount which shall be paid as maintenance by the husband.
(2)
 A husband or wife may in the prescribed manner, within the prescribed period, and on payment of the prescribed fee, prefer an application for revision of the certificate, [to the Collector] concerned and his decision shall be final and shall not be called in question in any Court.
(3)
 Any amount payable under subsection (1) or (2) if not paid in due time shall be recoverable as arrears of land revenue.""
Bare perusal of the above referred provision of law clearly postulates that the same would come into play on failure of husband to maintain his wife adequately or where there are more wives than one fails to maintain them equitably, the wife, or all or any of the wives may in addition to seeking any other legal remedy available, apply to the Chairman who shall constitute an Arbitration Council to determine the matter and Arbitration Council, in pursuance thereof, may issue a certificate specifying the amount which shall be paid as maintenance by the husband.
8.
 By virtue of Punjab Act XIII of 2015, subsection (1-A) was also inserted in Section 9 ibid, authorizing the mother or grandmother of the minor children to seek the same remedy. The remedy available under Section 9 of The Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 is clearly a remedy in addition to other available legal remedies. Section 9 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 neither imposes any embargo on institution of suit as is the present one nor any clog on the powers of the Family Court to proceed with such suit. The proceedings launched in terms of section 9 of The Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 cannot erode the suit instituted before the Family Court under the provisions of The Family Courts Act, 1964. The stance taken by learned counsel for the petitioner is even otherwise contrary to the plea raised by the petitioner in his written statement. The relevant extract is reproduced below:-
 After having an overview of the relevant provisions and the pleadings, no cavil is left that the contention of learned counsel for the petitioner is highly misconceived and ill-founded.
9.
 So far claim of dower and gold ornaments is concerned, Nikahnama (Exh.P2) clearly depicts that Rs.55,000/- was fixed as dower out of which, Rs.5000/- was paid and Rs.50,000/- was outstanding, which was payable on demand. In the light of admission made by the petitioner, the claim of dower to the extent of Rs.50,000/- was decreed in favour of respondent No.1.
10.
 Next comes the claim of gold ornaments weighing 3 Tolas which finds mention in the column No.17 of Nikahnama as Exh.P2. After having cursory look at the respective statements of the parties and analysis of Mark-D, which was decision of the Arbitration Council, it becomes evident that the petitioner was bound to pay 3-Tolas of gold ornaments or in lieu their price @ Rs.47,000/- per Tolas to the respondent No.1. The concurrent findings to this effect are unexceptionable.
11.
 Now adverting to the quantum of maintenance, it is observed that minor respondents Nos.5 and 6 were held entitled to get the maintenance @ Rs.3500/- per month w.e.f. 11th September, 2014 with 10% annual increase. Admittedly, the petitioner is running his own business, so in the light of available evidence, it cannot be said that the quantum of maintenance fixed by the learned Additional District Judge, is exorbitant or not in accord with the source of income of the petitioner. The minors are school going children and for meeting their day to day needs, Rs.35,00/- per month in all respects is justifiable amount for upbringing them.
12.
 For the foregoing reasons, I am of the considered view that the petitioner has failed to point out any illegality or material irregularity in the judgment under challenge. As a result thereof, this petition fails and is 
dismissed in limine.

 FAHIM AHMED SIDDIQUI, J---.
 Through the instant Civil Revision Application, the applicant has called in question the order of rejection of plaint passed on 21.12.2006 by the learned Senior Civil Judge-II, Larkana in F.C. Suit No.23/2006, which was maintained by the impugned judgment dated 02.10.2009 passed by the Additional District Judge-II, Larkana.
2.
 The facts in a nutshell are that prior to the aforesaid suit, three suits were filed by the applicant with different prayers viz. the Specific Performance of Contract, Injunction, Declaration and Injunction so also Restoration of Possession. Those suits were withdrawn with the permission to file fresh suit under the no objection of the other side. Consequently, the lawsuit as mentioned earlier was filed for ""Specific Performance of Contract, Restoration of possession, Compensation and Permanent Injunction."" In the said suit, the applicant (plaintiff) claimed the ownership on C.S No.819 as well as adjacent S.C. No.818/2-B (from which 86 square feet in possession of applicants) which was allotted to respondents Nos.01 to 06 and purchased by applicants in 1974 for a consideration of Rs.12,900/- out of which Rs.10,000/-was paid and the remaining to be paid at the time of registration of sale deed. The applicants/plaintiffs further asserted in the plaint that their predecessor (Abdul Majeed) had constructed five shops over some portion of his house situated in C.S. No.818/2-B area 86 square feet. It is further asserted that one Faiz Mohammed son of Haji Noor Mohammed (predecessor of respondents Nos.07 to 14) owned and possessed a property bearing C.S. No.818/1-A/1 (area 501-08 square yards). The house of Faiz Muhammad is adjacent to the plot purchased by the said Abdul Majeed viz. C.S No.818/2-B, and he came to him (Abdul Majeed) and claimed himself to be its owner and threatened that he would occupy the same forcibly; hence the suit mentioned above was filed.
3.
 The learned counsel for the applicants assailed the order of the Court of the first instance as well as appellate Court from different angles. According to him, the earlier three suits filed by the applicants were withdrawn with the permission to file fresh suit for which the respondents have given no objection in writing before the trial court. He submitted that the application under Order XXIII, Rule 1, C.P.C. was allowed on 31.01.2006 and subsequently the new suit being F.C. Suit No.23/2006 was filed on 17.2.2006 and after a long time i.e. on 21.12.2006 the trial court rejected plaint under Order VII, Rule 11 of C.P.C. He pointed out that the last suit being Suit No.23/2006 was for the purpose of possession, compensation, mandatory and permanent injunction and it is settled law that there is no limitation for possession. He further submitted that it is the settled law that limitation is a mix question of facts and law as such without framing of issues, plaint cannot be rejected. According to him, an application under Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. requires evidence if it is on the point of limitation. He submitted that as the previous suits were withdrawn with the permission to file a new suit for which respondents have given no objection; therefore, the new suit is not hit by ""principle of res judicata"" while limitation is also covered on the ground of previous suits. According to him, the new suit of the applicants is maintainable in all respect, and the order of the rejection of the same is neither proper nor legal. During arguments, the learned counsel for the applicants relied upon the following case laws:
(i)
 
Dr. Salahuddin Ahmed v. Ministry of Works and another
 (1983 CLC 457).
(ii)
 
Bashir Ahmed v. Government of Sindh
 (1984 CLC 3061).

(vii)

4.
 The learned counsel for the respondents while opposing the instant revision application drew the attention of this Court towards some paragraphs of the plaint. According to him, for the purpose of deciding an application under Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. the contents of the plaint are looked into and if it is evident from the substance of the plaint that it is barred by limitation; then the plaint should be rejected. According to him, from the title of the plaint, it is clear that the main relief claimed in the suit was the 'specific performance' while possession was the ancillary relief of specific performance. He submitted that it would be clear from the contents of paragraph number 13 of the plaint that the suit was barred by limitation. He contended that the agreement was shown to be executed on 12-6-1974 while the lawsuit was filed in 1990 with main relief of the specific performance as such the same was rightly declared as time barred. In response to a query, he submitted that as per record no objection was ever raised regarding limitation in the previous three suits which were withdrawn. He argued that no doubt the respondents have given no objection regarding withdrawal of previous three suits, but the same was by reserving a right to raise any legal objection of limitation on the new suit. He submitted that the learned judge of the trial court regarding his findings based on the plaint only and he did not look into any exterior material. According to him, there is no need to frame issue regarding limitation because the point of limitation was floating on the record. He submitted that the order of the trial Court, as well as the judgment of appellate Court, are according to legal norms and principle, as such he prayed for dismissal of the instant civil revision. In support of his contention, he relied upon the following case laws:
(i)
 George Levi v. Mrs. Zakia Sulatan (1984 SCMR 3066).
(ii)
 Muhammad Khan v. Muhammad Amin through LRs and others (2008 SCMR 913).
5.
 I have heard the arguments advanced and had gone through the material placed before me. In the instant case, the premise of consideration is whether the suit is liable to be rejected on the point of limitation?
6.
 The well-settled proposition is that while considering the application under Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C., it is not necessary to take into consideration the defence set up by the defendant in his written statement or other documents. The question whether plaint discloses any cause of action and whether it is barred by any law is to be decided by looking at the averments in the plaint itself without any prejudice from the defence set up in the written statement. While considering the application under Order VII, Rule 11, the strength or weakness of the case of the plaintiff is not to be examined. It is settled that the Court has to find out from the allegations made in the plaint itself and not beyond it as to whether the plaintiff has initiated any vexatious or frivolous litigation. The Court cannot take into account materials beyond the plaint to declare that the case of the plaintiff is trivial or is barred by any law. In the instant matter, it cannot be denied that the suit was filed for ""Specific Performance"" of an agreement and the claim of possession is the ancillary relief of the specific performance. It is also established from the record that possession of the disputed property was never handed over to the applicants in any manner.
7.
 It is settled law that the plaint has to be looked as a whole to consider whether the plaint is liable to be rejected either on the ground of limitation or on the other reasons as enumerated under Order VII, Rule 11 of C.P.C. It is also settled that law of limitation is a mixed question of law and fact; therefore, when the pleading in the plaint makes it clear that the suit is barred by limitation, the plaint can be rejected on the ground of limitation. However, when there are allegations in the plaint, which require a roving enquiry to give a finding whether the suit is barred by limitation and in that context, the Court should conduct a roving enquiry to find out whether the suit is barred by limitation. Bearing these principles in mind, now it will be seen whether the allegations made in the plaint, which was filed before the trial Court, make out a case that the suit is barred by limitation.
8.
 I have gone through the entire plaint of the suit initiated before the trial Court. It is alleged in the plaint that the plaintiff entered into an agreement with the defendants Nos.1 to 6 on 12-06-1974 and payment of Rs.10,000/- was made out of agreed amount of Rs.12,900/- and remaining amount to be paid within short time i.e. on the date of registration of sale deed. It is alleged in paragraph 9 of the plaint that the cause of action arose in or about May, 1999 when defendant No.7 came to the house of the plaintiff and claimed ownership of the property in question. I would like to reproduce paragraph 9 of the plaint, which is as under:
""9.
 That the cause of action actually arose in about May, 1999 when the defendant No.7 came to house of plaintiff and claimed ownership of plot on which 05 shops of plaintiff are constructed and defendant No.7 offered costs of material to plaintiff which he refused and plaintiff being real owner did not accept his demand therefore defendant No.7 threatened the plaintiff to occupy the shops forcibly.""
The cause of action was further defined in paragraph 13, which is reproduced as under:
""13. That the cause of action actually accrued in about May, 1999 for Specific Performance of Contract when the defendants Nos.1 to 6 refused to execute the registered deed of sale hence F.C. Suit No.90 of 1999 was filed within time and so also when the plaintiff was dispossessed on 25.07.1999 from the 05 shops illegally therefore the suit for restoration of possession under section 9 of Specific Relief Act and compensation for un-authorized use at the rate of Rs.500/- per shop and the total amount of Rs.2,500/- for 05 shops was claimed from August 1999 and said suit was filed on 04.08.1999 within time but all the 03 suits were withdrawn with the permission to file a fresh suit by correcting the contents of all the 03 suits and therefore the present suit is within time due to reason that the permission is granted by this Hon'ble Court on an application under Order XXIII, Rule 1, C.P.C. on 31.01.2006 with no objection from other side for allowing an application under Order XXIII, Rule 1, C.P.C.""
9.
 It is admitted position that prior to the present suit, the applicants filed three different suits with the various prayers but subsequently all those suits were withdrawn by filing an application under Order XXIII, Rule 1 of C.P.C. with the permission to file new suit covering the contents of all the suits previously filed. The respondents' counsel has given no objection in the following terms:
""No objection to the withdrawal of suits only. I reserve the right to raise any legal objections of limitation etc., on fresh suit.""
 From the above no objection, it is clear that the same was not unconditional, but the fact is that the counsel for the respondents has manifested his intention to challenge the limitation of the proposed fresh suit.
10.
 As mentioned above, the question of limitation is admittedly a mixed question of facts and law, but it is not necessary that the question of limitation remains an intricate issue because of the complexity of facts and law. In those cases, where the issue of limitation is obvious and crystal-clear, there will be no need of roving enquiry by formulating a point or issue and leading evidence for the same. It is settled law that there will be no need of enquiry if the question of limitation is floating on the record without any proper explanation and no allegation is made in the plaint, which requires evidence to determine the time for accruing of the cause of action for the plaintiff. In this respect the learned counsel for the respondents has rightly taken reliance of the case reported as Muhammad Khan v. Muhammad Amin through LRs and others (2008 SCMR 913) wherein the honourable Supreme Court held as under:
""On perusal of paragraph 18 of the plaint it appears that the petitioner in the plaint averred that the cause of action accrued to the plaintiff in the month of January, 2000 when the petitioners approached the defendants, to sale the suit property after issuance of T.O. Form. The plaint in the suits were admittedly filed on 5-1-2004. Evidently the suit was filed beyond the period of limitation prescribed under Article 113 of the Limitation Act it must be stated that the fact of limitation is evident from the averments made in the plaint itself. In such circumstances, the trial Court was not required to frame issue and record evidence.""
11.
 The Honourable Supreme Court has taken the similar view in the case reported as Akram Yaseen and others v. Asif Yaseen and others (2013 SCMR 1099).
12.
 In paragraph 13 of the plaint, the applicants (plaintiffs of the suit) took a plea that since the new suit was filed after the permission of the Court; therefore, the period of limitation will cover under the date of filing of the previous suits. In this respect, my observation is that no doubt under Order XXIII, Rule 1, C.P.C. provides for the filing of the fresh suit with the permission of the Court. However, under Order XXIII, Rule 2, C.P.C., the plaintiff is bound by the law of limitation in the same manner as if the previous suit had not been instituted and the plain interpretation of this rule is that period of limitation would have started in accordance to cause of action firstly accrued. In this respect, I would like to take reliance from the case of the honourable Supreme Court reported as Mst. Anwar Bibi and others v. Abdul Hameed (2002 SCMR 144) in which it is held as:
""Besides the first suit was withdrawn under Rule 1 of Order XXIII, C.P.C., therefore, section 14 of the Limitation Act was not applicable in view of the provisions of rule 2 of said Order which provides that in any fresh suit instituted on permission granted under rule 1 the plaintiff shall be bound by law of limitation in the same manner as if first suit has not been instituted.""
13.
 The learned counsel for the applicants has relied upon a teaming number of case laws in support of his contention. In the cases of Dr. Salahuddin Ahmed v. Ministry of Works and another (1983 CLC 457) and Mst. Miraj Bibi v. Additional District Judge and others (1991 CLC 1405), it is held that if mala fide is alleged in the plaint, then the evidence is needed. The said case law is inapplicable because no specific incident of mala-fide is quoted in the plaint nor it was pointed out by the learned counsel for the applicant. He also relied upon the case of Qazi Sher Muhammad and others v. Nazar Ali Shah and others (1985 CLC 2883) in which it is held that the plaint can be rejected on the basis of the averment of the plaint only, and this aspect has been discussed in detail in the preceding paragraphs. The learned counsel for the applicants also relied upon the case of Messrs Kashmirian (Pvt.) Ltd., through Shomaila Loan Marker and 6 others v. Ghulam Nabi Gujjar and another (2006 CLC 482), which pertains to the question of adverse possession as such the same is inapplicable to the facts of the present case. The learned counsel for the applicant also relied upon the case reported as Abdul Hamid and another v. Dilawar Hussain alias Bhalli and others 2007 SCMR 945), but the same is also not applicable to the present case as in the case of Abdul Hamid (supra), the plaint was rejected because of insufficient court fee and not on account of limitation.
14.
 In the present case, the agreement on which the applicants are relied upon for the specific performance was executed on 12.6.1974 while the suit for the specific performance of the same was filed in the year 2006. As far as the cause of action is concerned, it is claimed to be accrued to the plaintiff (applicants) in the year 1999. The period of limitation under Article 113 of Limitation Act, 1908 is provided being 'three years'. Because of paragraph 9 and paragraph 13 of plaint, it is evident that the cause of action was shown to be accrued in the year 1999 for the specific performance of the contract allegedly executed in the year 1974, as such the suit was badly time-barred. Upon consideration of the plaint averments, the two forums below have rightly come to the conclusion that the suit is barred by limitation and No substantial grounds are made out by the applicants (plaintiff) warranting the interference of the Order of both the Courts below.
15.
 The consequential outcome of the above discussion is that the instant civil revision is dismissed with no order as to cost.

3.
 The prosecution story, in brief, as unfolded in the complaint Ex.PK, on the basis of which FIR No.433/2012 (Ex.PK/1) was lodged by Muhammad Shahid complainant, was that on 23.12.2012 at 5.00 p.m., his son namely Ameer Hamza went to the shop of the Mohalla and did not return. He searched his son but could not succeed. The matter was reported to the police against unknown persons. On 25.12.2012, the complainant moved another application Ex.PR suspecting that Jabir Hussain appellant, whose shop was closed for two days and was also not traceable, has abducted his son. Hence the present FIR was got registered against him.
4.
 Muhammad Suleman, S.I. (PW.15), on entrustment of investigation of this case, on 24.12.2012, proceeded to the place of occurrence, inspected the spot and also visited house of the complainant. He prepared un-scaled site plan, investigated the matter and started searching the accused. On 25.12.2012, at 5.00, complainant Muhammad Shahid moved an application implicating Jabir Hussain appellant as accused of abduction of his son. He recorded statements of the witnesses. On 26.12.2012, he arrested the appellant who disclosed that he committed sodomy with the victim Ameer Hamza, who raised hue and cry whereupon the appellant strangulated him with hands at his throat. The appellant further disclosed that he put the dead body into a deep freezer lying in his shop after tightening his hands and legs with cloth and got recovered the dead body in the presence of witnesses which was taken into possession vide (Memo Ex.PS). He prepare rough site plan of the place of recovery of the dead body vide (Memo Ex.PV). He also took into possession deep freezer vide Memo (Ex.PE), prepared inquest report Ex.PW and injury statement (Ex.PX). He deputed Nisar Ahmad Constable for conducting post-mortem examination of the dead body. After conducting post-mortem examination, Nisar Ahmad Constable handed over last worn clothes of the deceased along with post-mortem report and other articles which were taken into possession vide Memo (Ex.PT). He recorded the statements of the witnesses under section 161, Cr.P.C. He took physical remand of the accused on 27.12.2012 and on the same day, the accused led to the recovery of last worn clothes of the deceased which were taken into possession vide Memo (Ex.PG). On 28.12.2012 Aamer Sattar Constable handed over seven snaps of the deceased P1-P7 which were taken into possession vide Memo (Ex.PB). He summoned Bilal Masood Bhatti Draftsman, who took rough notes on the pointation of the PWs and drafted site plan (Ex.PA) and (Ex.PA/1). On 29.12.2012, he got examined the accused for potency test vide written application (Ex.PM) and report (Ex.PM/1). He also joined in the investigation, Mst. Shagufta Nawaz wife of Muhammad Nawaz, (PW.13) owner of the shop, who disclosed that the appellant was tenant in the shop and paid Rs.2,000/- per month as rent. On 03.01.2013, he visited Gujranwala and recorded statement of Jabbar Ahmad, Sales Officer of the PEPSI and took into possession agreement deed (Ex.PJ) whereby accused was entrusted a freezer by the company.
5.
 Talib Hussain S.I. (PW16) partially investigated the case. On 21.2.2013, Mst. Shagufta Nawaz joined investigation and produced copy of registered sale deed of the house (Ex.PD). On the same day, Faisal Aslam (PW-14) produced before him agreement (Ex.PC) which was taken into possession vide recovery Memo (Ex.PC/1). After completion of investigation, the challan was prepared and submitted before the court. The learned trial court, after observing legal formalities, as provided under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 framed charge against the appellant on 21.02.2013, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
6.
 In order to prove its case, the prosecution examined as many as sixteen witnesses.
7.
 The medical evidence was furnished by Dr. Zakir Ali Rana Medical Officer, (PW.8). On 26.12.2012 at 11.30 p.m., he conducted the postmortem examination on the dead body of Ameer Hamza deceased.
 In his opinion, the death was occurred due to asphyxia as a result of throttling. Probable duration between injuries and death was approximately 3 to 5 minutes whereas, between death and postmortem examination was three days.
8.
 Muhammad Shahid, complainant (PW-11) supported the prosecution story as mentioned in the FIR. Sarfraz Ahmad (PW-12) was witness of arrest and disclosure of the accused, made before the police and also witness of recovery of dead body. Mst. Shagufta Nawaz (PW-13), owner of the shop stated that the appellant was his tenant. Faisal Aslam (PW-14), Sales Officer of Naubahar Bottling Company, Gujranwala stated that company has delivered deep freezer to the appellant for his shop. Bilal Masood Draftsman (PW-1) prepared scaled site plans (Ex.A) and (Ex.PA/1) of the place of occurrence Rest of the witnesses are of formal in nature, therefore, need not to be discussed.
9.
 Learned Deputy District Public Prosecutor gave up Mubarik Ali 100/C, Muhammad Anwar 2181/C, Sajjad Ahmad, Riaz Ahmad, Muhammad Tariq and Muhammad Khalid PW being unnecessary and after tendering in evidence the report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency (Ex.PZ) close the case of prosecution.
10.
 In his statement recorded under section 342, Cr.P.C., the appellant pleaded false implication. He neither appeared as his own witness under section 340(2), Cr.P.C. nor produced any witness in his defene. In answer to a question why this case against you and ""why the PWs deposed against you"", the appellant stated as under:-
""I have been falsely implicated in this case. I am totally innocent. Neither I abducted Ameer Hamza deceased nor committed sodomy with him, nor murdered him. It is a case of no evidence. The evidence produced against me is totally false, fake, frivolous and fabricated and the story introduced by the prosecution is concocted one. In fact, I have not taken this shop on rent and I am also not owner of the said rented shop. Neither I obtained the shop on rent from Shagufta Bibi nor entered into any agreement regarding said shop with any body. The freezer which has been shown by the prosecution as to be taken by me from Nau Bahar Bottling Company nor I signed any agreement. The said freezer was not owned by me. ""PW.11 Muhammad Shahid admitted that dacoity was committed into the jewelry shop of his brother prior to the present occurrence. They got recorded FIR in Police Station Sadar Wazirabad and named accused in said FIR. But accused could not be traced out"".
After my arrest in this case about ten people met the complainant party as well as during course of investigation for proving my innocence but in vain. It is pertinent to mention here that neither I made disclosure or extra judicial confession before I.O. nor dead body of the deceased was recovered on my pointation. In fact deceased Ameer Hamza was abducted by some unknown persons who committed dacoity into the shop of complainant's brother. These unknown persons who committed this occurrence. Actually they demanded ransom from complainant party and these unknown persons were in the knowledge of the complainant party as well as police but they could not be traced out. The complainant party in connivance with the police wrongly and malafidely falsely implicated me in this case. The local police in order to get rid of this case wrongly challaned me in this false case. I am a married person having three children and earning head of my family. I am a law-abiding religious and noble person of the society. The PWs are related inter se, hence they have deposed falsely against me.""
11.
 After evaluating the evidence and considering the merits of the case, the learned trial court held the appellant guilty, convicted and sentenced him as detailed above. Now, this appeal.
12.
 Learned counsel for the appellant contended that he was not nominated in the FIR rather, his name finds mention in the application (Exh.PR) moved on 25.12.2012; that the case of prosecution entirely rests on circumstantial evidence and there was no direct evidence to connect the appellant with this occurrence; that the prosecution has badly failed to prove the charge levelled against the appellant; that the evidence produced by the prosecution suffered from the material contradictions; that there was no independent witness to support the prosecution version; that the case of the prosecution does not fall under Article 40 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, therefore, on the basis of such evidence, conviction and sentence awarded to the appellant cannot be sustained; that the prosecution could not establish through convincing-cogent evidence that the appellant was running the shop wherefrom the dead body of the deceased was recovered lying inside a deep freezer; that no evidence was brought on the file to establish the tenancy of the appellant; that the scaled/unscaled site plans, both, reflected that there was nothing in the shop except deep freezer; that there was no eye-witness of the occurrence; that the investigation in this case was dishonest and mala fide from the very inception as the police investigating the case did everything with a set mind to pin the crime on the appellant and though an out of the way effort was made to strain every evidence against the appellant, yet the investigating agency failed to collect any evidence as could prove that it was the appellant who killed the deceased. Learned counsel for the appellant contended that the death sentence is not warranted in a case which rests upon circumstantial evidence. He submitted that there was no credible evidence available with the prosecution to prove the guilt of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt, thus, it was a fit case for acquittal.
13.
 On the other hand, learned Additional Prosecutor General assisted by the learned counsel for the complainant argued that the case against the appellant was proved beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt. It was submitted that the learned trial Court had thoroughly examined the entire evidence adduced by the prosecution and reached to the conclusion that the guilt of the appellant was fully proved, therefore, such findings being based on proper and careful appreciation of evidence called for no interference on mere discrepancies. It was contended that nomination of the accused in Exh.PR shows the bona fide of the complainant; that the disclosure made by the appellant in police custody resulted into the recovery of the dead body/deep freezer from the shop run by the appellant, thus, Article 40 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order was attracted; that the prosecution produced the independent witnesses having no malice/animus for false implication; that the case of prosecution is further supported by the medical evidence suggesting injuries on both thighs and anal canal of the deceased who was just five years old; that no link in the chain was missing and even capital sentence can be awarded on the basis of circumstantial evidence. Learned counsel for the complainant frankly conceded that sections 364-A and 201, P.P.C. were not attracted in this case. Lastly, it was contended that the trial Court was quite justified to convict the appellant on the basis of material available on the record as there was no glaring contradictions in the testimony of the prosecution witnesses.
14.
 We have gone through the record carefully and considered the submissions of the learned counsel for the parties.
15.
 Before adverting to the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant, we shall at the threshold point out that in the present case, there was no direct evidence to connect the appellant with the offence in question and the prosecution rests its case solely on circumstantial evidence. The apex Court in the series of judgments has consistently held that when a case rests upon circumstantial evidence, such evidence must satisfy the following test:
(i)
 The circumstances from which an inference of guilt is sought to be drawn, must be cogently and firmly established;
(ii)
 Those circumstances should be of a definite tendency pointing towards guilt of the accused;
(iii)
 The circumstances should form a chain so completely that there is no escape from the conclusion that the crime was committed by the accused; and
(iv)
 The circumstantial evidence in order to sustain conviction must be complete and capable of explanation of any other hypotheses than that of the guilt of the accused and such evidence should not only be consisted upon the guilt of the accused but should be inconsistent with his innocence;
16.
 Bearing the above principles of law enunciated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, we shall scrutinize scrupulously and examine carefully the circumstances appearing in this case with serious and onerous responsibility imposed on the Court.
17.
 Indisputably, charges can be proved on the basis of the circumstantial evidence, when direct evidence is not available. It is well settled that in a case based on a circumstantial evidence, the prosecution must prove that within all human probabilities, the act must have been done by the accused. The case of prosecution is required to be covered by leading cogent, believable and credible evidence.
18.
 The circumstantial evidence (Al-Qarinah) is also one of mode to find out guilt or innocence of the accused under the Islamic law. The terms "" Qarinah"" comes from the root word ""Qarana"" which signifies ""connecting something"" Technically ""Qarinah"" means any sign, proof or evidence which is circumstantial in nature which may corroboratively give a definite impression of an occurrence of any relevant fact or any fact in issue in a case. ""Qarinah"" in its literal meaning, means connection, conjunction, relation, union, affiliation, linkage or association. However, in legally speaking, it refers to logical inference to be drawn from the circumstances. By now, ""Al-Qarinah"" has been accepted and recognized as one of the means of proof. The reason for admitting ""Qarinah"" is based from sources in Holy Quran:
""They stained his shirt with false blood. He said: ""Nay, but your minds have made up a tale (that may pass) with you (for me) patience is most fitting: against that which ye assert it is ALLAH(alone) whose help can be sought."" (Al-Quran, 12:18)
""So they both raced each other to the door, and she tore his shirt from the back: they both found her lord near the door. She said: ""What is the (fitting) punishment for the one who found formed an evil design against thy wife, but prison or grievous chastisement?"". He said: ""it was she that sought to seduce me from my (true) self."" and one of her household saw (this) and bore witness, (thus) ""if it be that his shirt is rent from front, then is her tale true, and he is a liar! ""but if it be that his shirt is torn from the back, then is she the lair, and he is telling the truth. (Al-Quran 1225-27)
 In fact, awareness has been given to this world 1437 years ago by the Allah Almighty in the Holy Book of Quran in Surah Yousaf wherein this method of proving a guilt or innocence has been highlighted. The applicability of ""Qarinah"" in proving a case is nowhere expressly provided by the Holy Quran. However, its applicability could be gleaned by references of several verses in the Holy Quran together with analogical deduction.
19.
 The instant case is entirely based upon circumstantial evidence. The deceased, namely, Ameer Hamza (05 years old boy), on 23.12.2012 at 5.00 p.m., left for a shop in his street to fetch some candies but never returned. The complainant reported the kidnapping/disappearance of his son to police on 23.12.2012 through an application Exh.PQ. Thereafter, got registered FIR (Exh.PK) regarding incident against unknown accused on 24.12.2012 and then, nominated the appellant in his application Exh.PR moved on 25.12.2012. The appellant was arrested on 26.12.2012 and disclosed that he could not control his sexual lust and that after committing sodomy with Ameer Hamza eliminated him by way of strangulation and then got recovered his dead body as a result of said disclosure from a deep freezer lying in his shop. However, learned counsel for the appellant raised objection regarding admissibility of the disclosure made by the appellant.
20.
 In order to apply Article 40 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 the prosecution must establish that information given by the accused led to the discovery of some fact deposed by him and discovery must be of some fact which the police had not previously learnt from any other source and that the knowledge of the fact was first derived from the information given by the accused. In the instant case, the police had no previous knowledge if the appellant kept the dead body of the deceased inside a deep freezer lying in his shop and when the appellant disclosed such fact, the Investigating Officer in presence of marginal witnesses, discovered the above referred deep freezer, dead body of the deceased, so the information of the appellant fully comes within the scope of Article 40 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984: Ref: ""Mst. Askar Jan and others v. Muhammad Daud and others"" (2010 SCMR 1604).
21.
 In order to prove its case, the prosecution produced Faisal Aslam as PW.14. He served for three years being Sales Officer and deposed that on 07.3.2011, the appellant approached his company ""Nau Bahar Bottling Company"" Pvt. Ltd, for the delivery of a deep freezer of Pepsi company for his shop. He referred to an agreement entered into between the appellant and the company (Exh.PC) evidencing the delivery of deep freezer against the terms and conditions mentioned therein. The prosecution also produced Mst. Shagufta Nawaz, wife of Muhammad Nawaz the owner of the shop (PW.13). She deposed that she had rented out the shop to the appellant on a monthly rent of Rs.2000/-. The appellant was running that shop in the name and style of ""Inam Karyana Store"". During investigation, it revealed that Inam was a son of the appellant.
 The appellant pleaded false implication that he was involved in this case because local police wanted to get rid of this false case, as reflected by his statement recorded under section 342, Cr.P.C. It was not imperative for the appellant to appear as his own witness under section 340(2), Cr.P.C. in disproof of the allegations or to examine some witnesses in his defence but in this case, he could not substantiate his plea that he was not running the shop as stated by Mst. Shagufta Nawaz (PW.13). The trend of cross-examination rather, suggested that he was running ""Inam Karyana Store"" as borne out from the statements of Bilal Masood draftsman (PW.1) and Sarfraz Ahmad (PW.12). At this juncture, we may mention that the plea of the appellant of not running a shop is after-thought as no such suggestion was put to any witness till the examination of Mst. Shagufta Nawaz (PW.13).
22.
 The appellant got recovered the deep freezer (P-10) delivered to him by the Pepsi company through memo (Exh.PE). It was lying in his shop and also shown in the scaled and unscaled site plans of the place of occurrence. The dead body of the deceased was lying frozen inside the said deep freezer in the month of December and was identified by Sarfraz Ahmad (PW.12). The appellant could not produce any witness or any local to establish that he was not running a shop in ""Sipaal"" colony. The prosecution witnesses including Faisal Aslam, Shaghufta Nawaz and Sarfraz Ahmad have no relation, whatsoever, with the deceased. They had no ostensible reason to depose against the appellant for his false implication. They remained firm and nothing favourable to the appellant was elicited during the cross-examination, thus, there was no reason to disbelieve their evidence.
 The autopsy was held by Dr. Zakir Ali Rana M.O (PW.8). He observed a ligature mark around the neck and found a nylon string on the neck of the deceased , taken into possession vide memo Exh.PT. He also observed the following injuries on his neck, head, thighs and anus.
(i)
 Ligature mark on neck anterior side around the neck;
(ii)
 Abrasion 3 x 4 cm under right thigh;
(iii)
 Abrasion 3 x4 cm under left thigh;
(iv)
 Lacerated wound 4 x 2 cm on the back and middle of head;
(v)
 Perianal anal tear 1.5 x .2 cm at 6'0 clock on upper border;
(vi)
 Perianal tear 1.5 x 2 cm at 6'0 clock on the lower border.
 No seminal material was identified on any item examined for the presence of semen, therefore, no further DNA profiling was conducted on these items as reflected by the report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency Exh.PZ. However, in view of injuries Nos.(ii), (iii), (v), (vi), section 377, P.P.C. is attracted.
23.
 As regard the contentions of the learned counsel for the appellant that imposition of death sentence awarded in the instant case which wholly rests upon circumstantial evidence, was not warranted, it may be mentioned here that the contentions appears to have been raised perhaps under the misconception. There is no prohibition in law that in a murder case conviction cannot be based on circumstantial evidence. In fact, it is not the quantity but sufficiency and quality of the evidence which matters. In a number of cases, including following imposition of death sentence has been approved by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan purely on the basis and in appreciation of circumstantial evidence which are as follows:
(i)
 ""Inayatullah v. The State"" (PLD 2007 SC 237). In this case, the plea was raised by the accused that capital punishment could not be awarded on the basis of circumstantial evidence and the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan observed that generally capital punishment could not be awarded to accused persons on the basis of circumstantial evidence, however, in the present case, if the pieces of circumstantial evidence collected during the investigation were put in juxtaposition then they would bring the case in the area where the accused was connected with the commission of offence coupled with the fact that the prosecution witnesses were disinterested:
(ii)
 In case ""Muhammad Aslam and others v. The State"" (1999 SCMR 845), none had seen the occurrence. The dead body of the girl was found in the house of the accused for which he lodged misguiding report at police station. The accused had himself pointed to the blood stained churri buried by him in the courtyard of his house. The accused persons were acquitted by the learned trial Court, however, on appeal to the Federal Shariat Court, they were convicted. The conviction and sentence of both the male accused persons including the sentence of death were maintained by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case purely resting on circumstantial evidence. In the wake of above, it thus, follows that in cases, where either direct evidence is not available or has not been found trustworthy, conviction can be recorded on the basis of circumstantial evidence alone subject to the condition that all the circumstances must lead to the guilt of the accused and no link in the chain should be missing.
(iii)
 ""Khubaib Ahmad v. The State"" (1992 SCMR 398). In this case, evidence of last seen together with extrajudicial confession, corroborated by the medical evidence and recovery of dead body of the victim at the instance of the accused was believed.
(iv)
 In the case of ""Khuda Bukhsh v. The State"" (2003 SD 690), the prosecution was depending completely on circumstantial evidence but the conviction and sentence of death inflicted on the appellant by the trial Court and confirmed by the Federal Shariat Court, was upheld by the Shariat Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan. In this view, we are fortified by the following reported judgments as well:
1)
 ""Khuda Bukhsh v. The State"" (2004 SCMR 331)
2)

 In this case there is strong circumstantial evidence which leads to the inference that Ameer Hamza was done to death after commission of sodomy by the appellant. The prosecution case is based on the recovery of deep freezer, dead body, a piece of string, medical evidence and the statements of PWs.12 to 14 having no reason for false implication of the appellant. The events which took place subsequently, disappearance of the appellant after closing his shop and then, recovery of the dead body after his arrest from his shop also cannot be doubted. The appellant could not point out any defect in the statements of the independent witnesses. The statements of the prosecution witnesses have been thrashed out, who all have supported the prosecution version and stood firm to the test of cross-examination and nothing beneficial could be elicited casting any doubt in their veracity.
25.
 It is settled principle of criminal jurisprudence that circumstantial evidence can only be based for conviction when it is incompatible with the innocence of the accused and is incapable of explanation of any other reasonable hypothesis than that of the guilt of the accused. It was held in the case ""Ali Khan v. The State"" (1999 SCMR 955) that where the case is resting on the testimony of circumstantial evidence, no chain in the link should be missing and that all the circumstances must lead to the guilt of the accused.
26.
 In view of the above discussion, the prosecution has been successful in establishing the guilt of the appellant. Acting like a beast, he subjected a boy of tender age to his unnatural lust and then strangulated him to death. The prosecution version finds support from the recovery of deep freezer, dead body, ""Fard Nishandahi"" and medical evidence. Another fact worth consideration is that the complainant or for that purpose other witnesses have had no motive to falsely implicate the appellant and instant case is also not a case of substitution of the accused, therefore, it does not appeal to reason as to why the legal heirs of the deceased would let go the real culprit and instead make the appellant scapegoat just for nothing.
27.
 So far as the charges under sections 201, 364-A, P.P.C. are concerned, suffice it to observe that no evidence was brought on record that the appellant forcibly kidnapped the minor/deceased. It is also settled by now that concealing a dead body by the accused himself does not amount to causing disappearance of evidence as contemplated by section 201, P.P.C.
28.
 No doubt, this murder is diabolical in conception and cruel in execution. The totality of the circumstances, unerringly, unfailingly and unshakably proves that the appellant alone was the perpetrator of this heinous crime. The result is that the conviction of the appellant and sentences awarded to him under sections 302(b) and 377, P.P.C. are maintained and the impugned judgment is modified only to the extent of setting aside the conviction under sections 201, 364-A, P.P.C.
29.
 With this modification, the appeal is hereby dismissed.
 Murder Reference is answered in the affirmative and death sentence is confirmed.

 Appeal dismissed."

 ADNAN-UL-KARIM MEMON, J.---
 In all the captioned Petitions similar points of law and facts are involved, hence the same are disposed of by this common judgment.
2. Petitioners have approached this Court for regularization of their service in Pakistan State Oil Company Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as ""PSO""). Their case is that they were appointed on wages in lower grade in different vacant posts from 1984 to 2013 in different years. They have been performing their duties honestly with due diligence and such Performance Certificates are attached with the Memo. of Petitions. Petitioner's further assertion is that they are eligible to be regularized under Office Memorandum dated 29.08.2008 issued by Government of Pakistan, Cabinet Secretariat, Establishment Division but the Respondent-Company is not regularizing them.
3.
 Syed Shoa-un-Nabi, learned counsel for Petitioners has argued that Petitioners are seeking regularization of their service in Respondent-Company and on identical points, facts and law, this Court vide order dated 11.01.2013 has allowed Constitutional Petition No.D-3882/2011 with directions to Respondent-Company to give benefits as contained in the Office Memorandum dated 29.08.2008. He next contended that Respondent-Company filed Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.95-K of 2013 before Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, which was declined and order of this Court was upheld vide order dated 17.05.2013. He next contended that Petitioners have been continuously working on permanent posts in the Respondent-Company.
4.
 Mr. Javed Asghar Awan, learned counsel for PSO/Respondent No.2 has argued that instant Petitions are not maintainable against Respondent-Company under Article 199 of the Constitution. He next contended that disputed question of facts are involved in the present Petitions regarding relationship of employment of Petitioners and Respondent-Company. He next contended that Petitioners have an adequate remedy in the shape of Petition before NIRC, which is not availed. He next contended that some colleagues of Petitioners approached NIRC in Appeal which was disposed of with directions to Respondent-Company not to terminate their service except by due course of law. The said order was challenged before this Court in C.P No.D-3882/2011 which was allowed vide order dated 11.01.2013 and the same was also assailed before Hon'ble Supreme Court. According to him, the case of colleagues of the Petitioners was distinguishable as they directly filed Petition before NIRC, whereas the Petitioners have directly approached this Court. He next contended that Petitioners Nos.1 and 44 approached NIRC during pendency of the instant Petitions. In support of his arguments, he relied upon the case of Farid Ahmed v. Pakistan Burma Shell and others (1987 SCMR 1463), Syed Ashraf Ali Shah and others v. Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd. (2008 SCMR 314), Naseer-ud-Din Ghori v. Federation of Pakistan and others (2010 PLC 323) and PIA and others v. Tanveer-ur-Rehman and others (PLD 2010 SC 676).
5.
 Mr. Ghulam Murtaza Saryo, learned counsel appearing on behalf of Respondent No.2 in C.P. No.4605/2013 has adopted the arguments advanced by Mr. Javed Asghar Awan, learned counsel for the PSO/ Respondent No.2 in other connected Petitions.
6.
 Mr. Chaudhry Muhammad Ashraf Khan, learned counsel for M/s HRSG Outsourcing (Pvt.) Ltd./Respondent No.3 has argued that Respondents Nos.2 and 3 executed an Agreement dated 14.09.2001. In pursuance of the said Agreement, Respondent No.3 engaged Petitioners to discharge contractual obligations. The salaries and monthly wages are being paid by Respondent No.3 and not by Respondent No.2. He next contended that Respondent No.3 is responsible for salaries, other liabilities and ancillary work. Per learned counsel, the Petitioners are employees of Respondent No.3 (Private Company) and not of Respondent No.2. He next contended that insofar as the Office Memorandum dated 29.08.2008 is concerned, it is not applicable to the case of Petitioners because it relates to the persons appointed on contract basis in different Organizations/Authorities of Government and Semi-Government, and Respondent No.3 is not an Organization controlled by Ministry of Cabinet Division. He next contended that Petitioners have no cause of action to claim regularization of their service in Respondent No.2. He next contended that facts of C.P. No.D-3882/2011 and CPLA No.95-K of 2013 are totally different from the facts and circumstances of instant Petitions. He next contended that some of the Petitioners had approached NIRC and order of NIRC was assailed in a Writ Petition on the basis of Identity Cards issued by Respondent No.2. He next contended that only NIRC has jurisdiction to entertain the grievance of Petitioners against Respondent No.2 which is a trans-provincial establishment. He next contended that factual controversy is involved in the instant Petitions hence, the same are not maintainable. He next contended that Petitioners are employees of Respondent No.3 and were appointed from September 2001 till the end of year 2013, therefore, the Petitions are badly hit by principle of latches. Learned counsel for Respondent No.3 has pointed out Identity Cards (from Pages Nos.63 to 183 of file) and Pay Slips (from Pages 185 to 303) annexed with respective Memo of Petitions in order to prove that Petitioners are in the employment of Respondent No.3. He next contended that Petitioners are taking all benefits of increment, salaries insurance, sickness, receiving workers participation fund as employees of contractor. In support of his case, learned counsel has relied upon the case of Mubeen-ul-Islam v. Federation of Pakistan and others (PLD 2006 SC 602).
7.
 We have heard learned counsel for the Parties and perused the material available on record and case law cited at the bar.
8.
 In the first place, we examine the issue of maintainability under Article 199 of the Constitution. Perusal of pleadings and arguments advanced by learned counsel for both the Parties establish that PSO is a Company Limited by shares with effect from the date of incorporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan under the Companies Ordinance, 1984 (XLVII of 1984).As per Section 2 (g) of Public Sector Companies, (Corporate Governance) Rules, 2013 'Public Sector Company' is defined as follows:-
(g)
 ""Public Sector Company"" means a company, whether public or private which is directly or indirectly controlled, beneficially owned or not less than fifty percent of the voting securities or voting power of which are held by the Government or any instrumentality or agency of the Government or a statutory body, or in respect of which the Government or any instrumentality or agency of the Government or a statutory body, has 
Otherwise power to elect, nominates or appoint majority of its directors, and includes a public sector association not for profit, licensed under Section 42 of the Ordinance.""
9.
 A reference may also be made in this regard to the decision of Honorable Supreme Court rendered in the case of Ramna Pipe and General Mills (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Sui Northern Gas Pipe Lines (Pvt.) (2004 SCMR 1274), in which it is settled that a Constitutional Petition against a Public Limited Company is maintainable.
10.
 In view of facts stated above, the status of PSO can ordinarily be regarded as a 'Person' performing functions in connection with the affairs of the Federation under Article 199 (1) (a) (ii) read with Article 199(5) of the Constitution Thus, High Court has jurisdiction to entertain a Constitutional Petition against PSO. As PSO is a Body Corporate and performing functions in connection with the affairs of the State. The functions of Company have element of Public Authority, as such the same will be amenable to the Writ Jurisdiction. Guidance has also been taken from the decision of august Supreme Court in the case of Abdul Wahab and others v. HBL and others (2013 SCMR 1383). In this case, the Honorable Supreme Court has held that two factors are most relevant i.e. the extent of financial interest of the State/Federation in an Institution and the dominance in the controlling affairs thereof. Reference may also be made to the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Salahuddin v. Frontier Sugar Mills and Distillery Ltd. (PLD 1975 SC 244).
11.
 On merits, the case of Petitioners is that they are working with Respondent No.2 for several years, but are not being regularized in service.
12.
 We have noted that Office Memorandum dated 29.08.2008 issued by Prime Minister of Pakistan entitles regularization of all contract employees, who are working in Autonomous and Semi-Autonomous bodies, corporations and were employed upto June, 2008. Petitioners are also claiming benefits of the said Office Memorandum.
13.
 Reverting to the contention of Respondent No. 3 that the Petitioners were employees of contractor (third party) who is engaged by Respondent No.2 to perform various functions. It may be mentioned that this issue has been settled by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Fouji Fertilizer Company Ltd v. National Industrial Relations Commissions and others (2013 SCMR 1253), the Hon'ble Supreme Court at Paragraphs Nos.17 and 18 has held as follows:-
""17.
 Normally, the relationship of employer and employee does not exist between a company and the works employed by the Contractor; however, in the case where an employer retains or assumes control over the means and method by which the work of a Contractor is to be done, it may be said that the relationship of employer and employee exists between him and the employees of the contractor. Further, an employee who is involved in the running of the affairs of the company; under the direct supervision and control of the company; working within the premises of the company, involved directly or indirectly in the manufacturing process, shall be deemed to be employees of the company.
18.
 In the instant case, the employees of the contractor were involved in running the affairs of the company such as filling and loading of urea bag as well as cleaning of machines and floors, therefore, for all intents and purposes, they are employees of the company through the contractor.""
14.
 It may be observed that in case the Petitioners are continuously performing their duties with the Company/Respondent No.2 from 1984 and other different years, they were paid salaries and issued passes directly at the behest of Respondent No.2, then the Office Memorandum dated 29.08.2008 is fully applicable to the Petitioners.
15.
 We are of the view that Petitioners are fully entitled to get benefits contained in Office Memorandum dated 29.08.2008 because they are in continuous service from 1984 and other different years respectively and have drawn salary from the Respondent-Company because they are regularly working on the posts of permanent nature. It may be noted that the colleagues of the Petitioners filed Constitutional Petition No.3882/2011 before this Court, which was allowed vide order dated 11.01.2013 and the same was upheld by the Hon'ble Apex Court vide order dated 17.05.2013 in CPLA No.95-K 2013 M/s PSO v. Ghulam Ali and others, has held as follows:
""Through these proceedings petitioners have challenged the judgment of the Sindh High Court passed on 11.1.2013 for regularization of the respondents in their organization.2.We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner company and according to him they outsourced the services of the respondents to a contractor and therefore, the High Court of Sindh by impugned judgment was in error to allow the petition of the respondents. 3. We have perused the record, which shows that the respondents were employed by the petitioner and working there since years. Respondents were issued security cards by the Civil Aviation Authority on the recommendation of the petitioner company. The entire material was placed before the High Court and the High Court by impugned judgment has recorded correct findings. It is contended that the issue ought to have been raised before the National Industrial Relations Commission (""NIRC""). We are not persuaded by the contention of the learned counsel on this score as well. NIRC cannot determine nor can order regularization of the respondents as it has limited scope.
4.
 For the aforesaid reasons we do not find any infirmity in the impugned judgment, which could warrant interference by this Court. Petition merits dismissal. Leave refused.""
16.
 Looking through the above perspective and keeping in view the factual position of the case, we hereby infer that the Petitioners ought to have been considered for regularization by the Respondent-Company in the light of Office Memorandum dated 29.08.2008. The issue in hand is fully covered by the order rendered by Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of M/s. Pakistan State Oil Company Limited v. Ghulam Ali and others (CPLA No. 95-K 2013) and Pir Imran Sajid and others v. Managing Director/General Manager (Manager Finance) Telephone Industries of Pakistan and others (2015 SCMR 1257), wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held at Paragraph 13 that:-
""looking through the above constitutional prism and keeping in view the facts that the federal government which owns, controls, manages and finances TIP has directed TIP to regularize the appellants, and that admittedly the appellants have initially been appointed in an open and transparent manner and after the vacancies were advertised in the newspapers, one cannot escape the conclusion that the appellants ought to have been regularized.""
17.
 We are further fortified with the similar principle referred to by the case-law decided by five Member Bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and others v. Adnanullah and others (2016 SCMR 1375), wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held at Paragraph 31 as follows:-
""The record further reveals that the Respondents were appointed on contract basis and were in employment/service for several years and Projects on which they were appointed have also been taken on the regular Budget of the Government, therefore, their status as Project employees has ended once their services were transferred to the different attached Government Departments, in terms of Section 3 of the Act. The Government of KPK was also obliged to treat the Respondents at par, as it cannot adopt a policy of cherry picking to regularize the employees of certain Projects while terminating the services of other similarly placed employees.""
18.
 We have reached the conclusion that case of Petitioners is also on the same footing as the one decided by the Honorable Supreme Court in the case of M/s. Pakistan State Oil Company Limited v. Ghulam Ali and others (CPLA No. 95-K 2013) (supra), Pir Imran Sajid and others (supra) and in the case of Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and others (supra).
19.
 The case laws cited by learned counsel for Respondents are distinguishable from the facts and circumstances of the present case.
20.
 In the light of above facts and circumstances, the Petitions are disposed of in the terms whereby Chief Executive Officer of Respondent-Company/Respondent No.2 is directed to consider the case of Petitioners for regularization of their service without discrimination, in accordance with law and the dicta laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the cases referred to hereinabove within a period of two months from the date of receipt of this judgment. The listed application(s) stand disposed of accordingly.
MH/B-11/Sindh
 Order accordingly."

 MUHAMMAD FAISAL KAMAL ALAM, J.---
The present proceeding (intestate in nature) in respect of the estate left by Tahir Ahmed Khan' (""Deceased"") has been filed by his legal heirs including Ms. Saira Ahmed Khan, one of the daughters, being the petitioner, with the following prayer:
""1.
 This Hon'ble Court may be pleased to grant a Letter of Administration in favour of the Petitioner for the complete estate of the Deceased, Late Mr. Tahir Ahmed Khan, as set forth in Schedule of Properties / Annexure ""D"" (Annexed herewith).
2.
 That this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to grant a Succession Certificate in favour of the Petitioner to the extent of the moveable property set forth in the Schedule of Properties.
3.
 Grant any relief as this Hon'ble Court deems fit and proper in the circumstances of the case.""
2.
 The names of legal heirs are mentioned in paragraph-4 of the petition and they all are children of the Deceased, who died at a Hospital in Karachi (Pakistan) on 18.07.2016. When queried about wife of the Deceased, that is, mother of present Petitioner and her siblings, the learned counsel has stated that the deceased had divorced his wife long ago, through a Divorce Deed dated 22 January, 1996, which was subsequently recognized by the relevant Authority (Committee) and a Certificate was also issued in this regard on 4th May 1996. As an evidence, both the Divorce Deed and the Committee Certificate issued in terms of Section 7 of the Muslim Family Law Ordinance, 1961, have been produced under a Statement of the Counsel for the petitioner.
3.
 Original Death Certificate of above named Deceased is appended as Annexure 'A' and Family Registration Certificate issued by National Database and Registration Authority (""NADRA"") is available at page-21 of the case file, evidencing the fact that no legal heir has been missed out. Both these documents are issued by the competent government, functionaries. Affidavits of two independent witnesses, who know the family of Deceased, have also been appended / filed in support of the claim, in order to meet statutory requisite of Succession Act, 1925, as well as the Sindh Chief Court Rules. Schedule of Property is available at page-23, according to which Deceased was maintaining a bank account in local branch of Standard Chartered Bank Limited (at Karachi), whereas two of his three immoveable properties are situated in United Kingdom (""UK""), whereas third apartment is situated at the 10th Floor, Torch Tower Building. Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Descriptions of the properties in the United Kingdom are given below:
1.
 Flat No.105, Crosshall Building, 9 Crosshall Street, Liverpool LI 6DQ, located in Liverpool, United Kingdom.
2.
 Unit 50, Libertas, 40-50 St. James Street, Liverpool LI OAB located in Liverpool, United Kingdom, and
4.
 The petitioner and legal heir No.3-Maha Tahir Khan, along with their above-named counsel appeared before the concerned Deputy Registrar (O.S) of this Court in respect of subject proceedings, whereas two other legal heirs, namely, Chenghez Ahmed Khan and Nada Tahir Khan, the son and daughter (respectively) of the Deceased, have sent their original Special Power of Attorney(s) from Pakistani Mission at Jeddah and Dubai, in support of the grant of instant petition, as these two legal heirs reside in the above countries.
5.
 Preliminary proceeding was conducted by the Deputy Registrar of this Court before whom parties have appeared and he also perused the documents produced. Publication of this petition was made in newspapers, namely, daily `Jang', in its issue of 19.10.2016 and 'The News', in its issue of 18.10.2016; both these newspapers have wide circulation. No adverse claim was filed by any person in respect of the estate left by the Deceased. Petitioner has also filed a Statement that the estate left by the deceased is not under any liability. Admittedly, instant matter remained non-contentious and thus estate is to be distributed amongst the legal heirs in terms of Section 37 of the Succession Act, 1925, which for convenience is reproduced herein below:
 ""37. Where intestate has left child or children only. Where the intestate has left surviving him a child or children, but no more remote lineal descendant through a deceased child, the property shall belong to his surviving child, if there is only one, or shall be equally divided among all his surviving children.""
6.
 The issue of maintainability was raised in view of a recent Judgment of the honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan reported in The All Pakistan Legal Decisions PLD 2016 Supreme Court page-174 [Muhammad Ramzan (Deceased) through L.Rs. and others] (Ramzan Case). On 18.01.2017, Mr. Umair A. Qazi, learned counsel for the petitioner, argued on the maintainability of the petition and submitted that the above Judgment of the Hon'ble apex Court is distinguishable on the facts and point of law while placing reliance on another Judgment of this Court reported in The All Pakistan Legal Decisions PLD 1968 Karachi page-480 (ibid) (Yusuf Abbas Case).
7.
 With the able assistance of the learned counsel for the
 Petitioner, I, have examined the record and have given my thoughtful consideration to the facts of present case and the question of law involved.
8.
 Present petition is about cross-border succession issue that falls
within the domain of Private International Law (`PIL'). In the first Judgment handed down by the honourable Supreme Court, (Ramzan's case) the basic facts were that a Suit for Administration was filed by mother in respect of the estate left by her deceased son, namely, Muhammad Anwar Irshad. In the said law suit, wife and children of the said Muhammad Anwar Irshad were impleaded as defendants, who were residing in England at that relevant time. Both properties (moveable and immovable) forming part of the estate were situated in Pakistan as well as England. Suit was partly decreed to the extent of moveable and immoveable properties situated in Pakistan only. The parties litigated up to the Honourable Apex Court (of Pakistan) when the afore mentioned Judgment was pronounced. 
9.
 In the above cited case, the earlier reported decision of Yousuf Abbas and others (ibid) has also been considered but not overruled. Their lordships (in Hon'ble Supreme Court) in paragraph-17 of the above Ramzan's Judgment have laid down the condition about the applicability of earlier case of Yusuf Abbas, only when facts of a case are covered by paragraph-21 of the later Judgment. It would be advantageous to reproduce (herein under) the paragraphs-17 of the Hon'ble Supreme Court's decision and paragraph-21 of the Sindh High Court's Judgment, in order to proceed further in the matter:
Hon'ble Supreme Court's decision in Ramzan case {supra}: 
 ""17. In light of the entire discussion undertaken, it may be stated that even if the rules of private international law are disregarded, the suit of the appellants in relation to the property situated abroad
 could only be entertained if it was brought within the purview of section 20, C.P.C.. as is clearly laid down in paragraph 21 of the
 judgment in the Yusuf Abbas case. But for the reasons stated above and from the given facts of the case, the present matter does not fall within the purview of section 20, C.P.C. Hence, Jurisdiction in relation to the property situated in England will' necessarily have to be determined with regard to the relevant principles of private international law. The courts of Pakistan could only take cognizance in relation to the immovable property situated in Pakistan subject to the limitations prescribed in section 16 of the C.P.C. It may be contended that they should not even have determined the rights to the movable property in Pakistan inter se the parties in derogation of the rule of lex domicilii in private international law. However, this element may have become irrelevant since the defendants submitted to the jurisdiction of Pakistani courts in relation to the movable property in Pakistan and, therefore the Pakistani courts were competent to determine the rights of the parties in relation to the same. But there is no legal justification for the courts in Pakistan to assume jurisdiction over any property, movable or immovable, situated in England.
 Conclusion: As can be discerned from the preceding discussion, cross-border succession gives rise to the most important question of jurisdiction of the courts. It must be understood that the question of jurisdiction is separate from the issue of the applicable law. It is correct to state that the English courts may apply Muslim law in such a case, hence the question to be addressed never revolved around the law applicable, rather the question was ultimately whether the courts in Pakistan had the jurisdiction as under sections 16 to 20, C.P.C. to entertain the suit in question and adjudicate upon the disputed property in England. Based on the reasons detailed above, this Court has answered the question in the negative, affirming the concurrent findings and conclusion of the courts below. The plain application of the relevant sections of C.P.C. provides that the courts in Pakistan will have jurisdiction in respect to property situated in Pakistan. The said sections do not envisage an extra-territorial exercise of jurisdiction, neither is such an extra-territorial exercise of jurisdiction desirable in clear violation of sections 16-20, C.P.C. and also in line with the established and recognized principles of private international law.
 In view of private international law this Court finds that the international responsibility of Pakistan to respect the territorial jurisdiction of England cannot be ignored. It has never been disputed that the property in dispute is situated outside Pakistan. As far as the Pakistani courts possessed jurisdiction over to the property situated in Pakistan, the decision was given in favour of the plaintiff Mst. Hafi (now deceased).""
 (Underlined for adding emphasis)
Sindh High Court's Judgment in Yusuf Abbas case (ibid):
 ""21. It will thus be seen that the Courts in Pa kistan and India have entertained suits for reliefs with regard to properties situated in foreign territories. In general, the view has been that this jurisdiction is not exercise under the Code of Civil Procedure, but on the principles which the Courts of Equity in England have applied in exercising jurisdiction in personam. I would, however, think that the exercise of this jurisdiction can be founded on the provisions of section 10 of the Civil Procedure Code itself. Under the explanation to section 16, the ""Property"" referred to in this, section, and also in sections 17, 18 and 19, mea ""property"" situated in Pakistan. If an action does not coin within the purview of any of these sections, section 20 can then be invoked, and an action can be brought in a court in Pakistan even with regard to foreign immovables, if any of the conditions enumerated in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of this section is in existence, that is, if the defendant, or each of the defendants resides or carries on business or personally works for gain within the local limits of the court's jurisdiction or, if only one of the defendant fulfils this condition, the court gives leave to sue the other's defendants or if the latter acquiesce in the institution of the suit, if the cause of action has wholly or partly arisen within the jurisdiction of the Court. Section 20, is, of course, made subject to the, limitations contained in sections 16, 17, 18 and 19. One of these limitations is that the property with regard to which the suit is brought should be properly situated in Pakistan. This particular limitation, however, would disappear if the property is not situated within Pakistan, in which case there will be no bar to the exercise of jurisdiction over foreign immovables under section 20 of the Code. In my opinion this section embodies the principles which the Courts of Equity in England have applied in exercising jurisdiction in personara. I would, therefore, venture to say that under section 20, a suit with regard to properties situate outside Pakistan can be brought in a Court in Pakistan, if the Court decides to assume jurisdiction and if there exists any of the conditions enumerated in this section for the exercise of the jurisdiction. If the Court does exercise jurisdiction, its judgment or order will be enforceable through the personal obedience of the defendants by dealing with them in an appropriate manner, such as for contempt or sequestration of their properties in Pakistan.""
10.
 Facts of the present case, which admittedly is a non-contentious one, have to be examined in the light of ratio decidendi of the above two Judgments; Ramzan and Yusuf Abbas cases. This is necessary because of peculiar facts of present petition, relating to the immoveable properties of the Deceased, which are situated in the jurisdiction of United Kingdom and United Arab Emirates, the Countries with which Pakistan has bilateral arrangement of enforceability of Judgments. This aspect is discussed in the following paragraphs.
11.
 The crux of the dictum laid down by the honourable Supreme Court in Ramzan case is that it is a settled rule of Private International Law that for an immovable property, the law of the place, where the immovable property is situated, will be applicable, that is, lex situs, whereas, for a moveable property, the governing law will be lex domicilii, that is, where the Deceased had resided, while holding that Pakistani Courts will have no jurisdiction in respect of the properties, which are outside Pakistan, but will only have jurisdiction to adjudicate upon those properties and issues arising therefrom, which are situated within the territorial limits of Pakistan. The above decision has a support of long standing doctrine of judicial comity as well as respect shown to sovereignty of other countries.
 In addition to the above, the other distinguishing factor was a serious objection of jurisdiction raised in the above Muhammad Ramzan case, by the defendants, who were residing in the UK, whereas in the present
 petition, it is an admitted position that all the parties, the petitioner and
 other legal heirs, have themselves submitted to the jurisdiction of this Court with a prayer that an order for the administration of the estate left by the Deceased be passed. The second distinguishing factor in the present case is that, admittedly it is a non-contentious matter and it has been specifically mentioned in the pleadings that
 though
 the
 Deceased
 was
 domiciled
 in
 Pakistan,
 having
 a Pakistani Passport and Computerized National Identity Card (CNIC); Annexure 'B' in the Court file, but have properties outside Pakistan. In this context, if paragraph-21 of Yusuf Abbas and others' (ibid), is read carefully for guidance, it was held, that Courts in Pakistan can exercise jurisdiction in respect of the properties outside Pakistan by invoking the rule of jurisdiction in personam and in such cases, Section 20 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908. inter alia, about cause of action vis- -vis an immoveable property situate within Pakistan, would not be applicable.
12.
 In addition to the above, in my considered view, Sections 13 and 44-A of our Civil Procedure Code, 1908, make a provision for recognition of foreign judgments by Pakistani Courts, as Pakistan also has a reciprocal arrangement with other Countries. It would be advantageous to reproduce the above provisions as under:
 ""13. When foreign judgment not conclusive. A foreign judgment shall be conclusive as to any matter thereby directly adjudicated upon between the same parties under whom they or any of them claim litigating under the same title except-

 The Research Department of our Court has provided informative
material for the present case; the most important of which is the Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act, 1933, promulgated by United Kingdom, inter alia, for recognition of foreign judgments of Superior Courts of other countries. Superior Court has been defined in subsequent legislation of UK having title: Pakistan Act 1990, which makes a reference to the earlier statutory instrument No.141 of 1958 of 'Judicial Committee', viz. The Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments (Pakistan) Order, 1958 (hereinafter collectively referred to as the ""U.K. Statutes""). In section 2 of this last statutory instrument, this Court has been mentioned as Superior Court, meaning thereby that decisions handed down by this Court are recognized and enforceable in the UK. It would be advantageous to reproduce herein under the relevant provision of Pakistan Act 1990: -
""Pakistan Act 1990
1990 CHAPTER 14

14.
 Learned counsel for the Petitioner has also placed reliance upon a case of Mian Aftab Ahmed v. Habib Bank Limited (mentioned in the title) having citation 2001 WL 825157, decided by Court of Appeal (Civil Division) on 31 July 2001, in order to fortify his arguments on behalf of Petitioner that by invoking above mentioned U.K. Statutes, the learned UK Court has in the above decision, given recognition to a Judgment handed down by High Court of Sindh (this Court) in a banking dispute.
15.
 Similarly, there is also a provision in the Civil Procedure Statute of United Arab Emirates with regard to enforceability of decisions given by
 other
 countries. The
 relevant
 provisions
 are
 mentioned
 in
 the Chapter IV of Volume Three, in Federal Law No.11 of 1992 of the Civil Procedure Law of United Arab Emirates. These provisions, inter alia, pertain to the Execution of Foreign Judgments, Orders and Deeds. Under Article (235) of this Chapter, recognition has been accorded to the Judgments and Orders given in Foreign Countries. Besides this, under an arrangement of reciprocity, the Federal Government (of Pakistan) through its Law, Justice and Human Rights Division has issued a Notification dated 06.03.2007 being S.R.O.208(I)/2007, inter alia, in exercise of powers mentioned under Section 44A of our Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, whereby United Arab Emirates has been declared a reciprocating territory and its Court of Appeal has been recognized as a Superior Court for the purpose of the said section. For the sake of reference, contents of said S.R.O. as well as relevant portion of the United Arab Emirates Civil Procedures Law are reproduced herein below: -
""NOTIFICATION
Islamabad the 6th March, 2007
 ""S.R.O. 208(I)/2007.-In exercise of the powers conferred by Section 44A of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Act V of 1908), the Federal Government is pleased to declare the United Arab Emirates to be a reciprocating territory and the Court of Appeal of the United Arab Emirates to be Superior Courts for the purposes of the said Section.-
 WHEREAS under section 44A of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Act V of 1908), the Federal Government is empowered to declare, by notification in the Official Gazette, any country to be reciprocating territory for the purposes of said section and also to declare Superior Courts with reference to any such territory;
 NOW, THEREFORE. in exercise of the powers conferred by section 44A ibid, the Federal Government is pleased to declare the United Arab Emirates to be a reciprocating territory and the Court of Appeal of the United Arab Emirates to be Superior Courts for the purposes of the said Section.""
 Similarly, relevant enactment of United Arab Emirates-Federal Law No.11 of 1992 provides_
""Article (235)
1.
 Judgments and orders passed in a foreign country may be executed in the UAE under the same conditions prescribed by the law of such a country.
2.
 The order for execution order shall be applied for before the court of First Instance in whose circuit the execution shall take place in the usual procedure for submission of the action; however, the order for execution may not be effected except when the following has been ascertained:-
 a. that State courts have no jurisdiction over a litigation in which the judgment or the order has been given, and foreign courts that have issued them have jurisdiction according to the international judicial jurisdiction prescribed in their laws.
 b. that a judgment or order has been issued by a competent court in accordance with the law of the country in which it is issued.
 c. that the parties to a lawsuit in which a foreign judgment has been issued have served with summons to appear, and that they are properly represented.
 d. that the judgment or order has acquired res judicata power according to the law of the court that has issued such an order.
 e. that it is not contradictory with a judgment or order already issued by a court in the State and that its contents are not in violation of public order or morals therein.
Article (236)
 The provisions of the preceding Article shall be applied to the arbitrium issued in a foreign country. The arbitrium shall be given in an arbitrable question according to the law of the state and be executable in the country where it was issued.
Article (237)
I.
 Authenticated instruments and records of reconciliation attested by the courts in a foreign country may be ordered to be executed in the state under the same conditions stipulated in the law of such country for the, execution of like instruments issued in the UAE.
2.
 The execution order referred to in the preceding paragraph shall be demanded by a petition to be submitted to the judgment of execution. The execution order may not be made until after ascertaining that the requisite conditions for enforceability of the instrument or the record are met according to the law of the country where the attestation or authentication thereto has been made, and that it is free from anything that violates morals or public order in the state.
Article (238)
 The rules provided for in the preceding Articles shall not affect the terms of treaties between the UAE and other states in this respect.""
16.
 After perusal of the cited case law and material on International Law, in my considered view, the Honourable Supreme Court has rightly enunciated the principles of Private International Law as mentioned herein above. However, had the above UK Statutes not held the field, there would have been no second opinion that; this Court has no jurisdiction in respect of the immovable properties situated in the United Kingdom, or for that matter, outside Pakistan. However, in light of the statutory provisions of United Kingdom and United Arab Emirates as reproduced herein above, and Notification of Government of Pakistan for recognition and enforcement of decisions with United Arab Emirates, I am compelled to distinguish this case from the above referred decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the Ramzan case, and make the preceding factors the ratio decidendi for my present decision.
17.
 The other inescapable aspect of the case is that when it is claimed that the world has become a global village and different international fora through multi-lateral treaties have been established for settlements and decision of disputes primarily arising out of financial transactions, trade liberalization policies are adopted by countries for enacting municipal laws having an ingredient of extra-territorial implication and application, then in the same way, those issues which are not purely of fiscal significance but concern rights and interests of a common person, should also be given equal importance. The world should not become a global village merely for achieving financial objectives but also for the convenience of an ordinary citizen (person). It would be an inconvenience. rather a hardship for the present Petitioner and her siblings to file the proceeding in respect of properties of her deceased father in three different Countries; Pakistan for moveable property, United Kingdom and United Arab Emirates for the immoveable properties, particularly, when instant Proceeding is a non-contentious in nature. Proprietary rights are mentioned in Article 17 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and hence they can neither be ignored nor their significance can be lessened.
18.
 Thus, in view of the above discussion, proceedings of the nature can be initiated in one of the jurisdictions, where the properties are situated
 and
 is
 enforceable
 in
 other
 foreign
 jurisdictions
 in
 view
 of
 the
 above
 mentioned
 Statutory
 provisions
 and
 Executive Instruments.
19.
 The upshot of the above discussion is that, present petition is granted as per Rules. The Petitioner will file an interim report within two months from today together with accounts of the estate in terms of section 317 of the Succession Act, 1925.
