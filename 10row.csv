0,"SAHIBZADA SANAULLAH, MEMBER, PROVINCIAL ASSEMBLY Versus GOVERNMENT OF KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA","June 13, 2017",PESHAWAR HIGH COURT, Honorable Justice Waqar Ahmad Seth ,2017 PLD 186,"JUDGMENT
 WAQAR AHMAD SETH, J.---
Sahibzada Sanaullah, Member Provincial Assembly, PK-93 Upper Dir, hereinafter called the petitioner, has invoked the writ jurisdiction of this Court under Article-199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 with the prayer to declare the discrimination in allocation of funds in the constituency of petitioner i.e. PK-93 in comparison to others as illegal, unconstitutional, void ab initio and direct the respondents to treat it at par / equal with others constituencies qua distribution of funds in all ADPs, in the interest of justice.
2.
 Facts, in brief relevant for the disposal of this writ petition are that, petitioner who is a returned candidate hailing from PK-93 Dir Upper, alleges that in General Election of 2013, one Behram Khan was declared as returned candidates and he remained as Member Provincial Assembly for sufficient time and being in alliance with the Government almost in all ADPs/developmental schemes/projects equal allocation of funds were granted/released to him/PK-93, which is evident from revised umbrella PC-1 ADP No. 732/150205 (2016-2017), however, after the decision of Election Tribunal as well as apex Court, when petitioner was declared as returned candidate, the existing projects/schemes standstill due to shortage of funds, besides other developmental schemes in all most all ADPs/other departments i.e. Irrigation and Communication of Works and Services Departments, funds have been distributed on discriminatory basis, depriving the locality/people of PK-93 from their due right as enshrined in Constitution by not treating them at par with other constituencies, hence the instant writ petition.
3.
 Comments were called from respondents which they furnished by negating the stance of petitioner and stated that umbrella PC-I for the scheme under ADP No.732 (2016-2017) ""Uplift of Rural Roads in Dir Upper and Dir Lower"" was originally approved at cost of Rs.500.00 million by PDWP forum. The cost of said ADP scheme has been enhanced through Chief Minister's Directive and consequently original cost increased to Rs.1050.00 million and revised PC-I was submitted by field office on need basis and get approval from PDWP forum. The subject scheme only covering two district i.e. Dir Upper and Dir Lower and the funds are allocated to the areas on need basis of the same districts and not constituency wise whereas no funds have been allocated out of the districts. There is no mechanism to allocate funds to members of Provincial Assembly, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The funds are allocated for the District on the recommendation of MPA, the constituency of the petitioner falls in Dir Upper and his District has been given 630 million against 1050 million.. That petitioner has not yet identified schemes under allocation of Rs.20.00 million. Furthermore, an amount of Rs.235.642 million has been allocated for developmental schemes of PK-93 in the last 40 years under ADP Nos. 730, 1316, 732 and RAHA programs, requested for dismissal of the writ petition.
4.
 We have heard learned counsel for the parties and available record gone through.
5.
 The facts which are not denying are that petitioner is the Member of Provincial Assembly from PK-93 Upper Dir, elected in the General Election 2013 and before the General Election 2013 the constituency of PK-93 was treated equally and in almost all the ADPs proper/equal allocation of funds were made to all the projects in the area and after that the funds allocated to the said constituency are much much less. Even in the district Dir, upper and lower which includes PK-91 to PK-97 the allocation of funds for PK-93 are 1/4th of the other allocation in other constituencies. For example at page-20 of the writ petition a breakup for the schemes ""uplift of rural roads in district Dir upper and lower, is a letter dated 20.12.2016, showing that PK-91 has been allocated 120 million, PK-92, 94, 95 and 96 are allocated 90 million each and PK-97 has been allocated 50 million while PK-93, are just with 20 million. Likewise in the first phase same was the position and in this respect documents attached at page-21 of the writ petition reflects the exact position. The obvious reasons mentioned by the petitioner that he belongs to opposition bench seems to be a correct allegation. Learned AAG along with representative of respondents failed to convince the Court that why is the such difference, even in the same district.
6.
 We have before us, the documents showing that petitioner time and again agitated the matter and finally vide letter dated 23.12.2016, Secretary Local Government was advised by the Worthy Chief Minister KPK to include in ADP scheme 732 to the constituency of PK-93, Upper Dir, but in spite of that nothing has been done as yet. The comparative statement placed on record clearly reflects that in the past, allocation of funds have been done discriminately, to the constituency of the petitioner in comparison to the members of ruling coalition partners. The allocation of funds to the Members of Provincial Assembly and their respective constituencies with different yardstick is not only discrimination of a particular member, but the public at large of a particular constituency have been deprived of their fundamental rights in all other departments as well.
7.
 This Court while deciding Writ Petition No. 4264-P of 2015, on 11.5.2016, while dealing with the royalty in reference to District Development Advisory Committee Act, 1989 and allocation of funds through the elected representatives has held as under:-
""There is no denial to the fact that royalty from the income of Oil and Gas discovered in the southern area is given to the concerned MPA for carrying of developmental project, in the district of Karak, Hangu and Kohat from the very inception. We have before us letter dated 25th August, 2015 issued from the Chief Minister Secretariat, addressed to Deputy Commissioner, Hangu, with the subject ""Identification of developmental schemes out of Oil and Gas Royalty, 2014-15"". The directions given by the Competent Authority are that funds amounting to rupees 108.00 million be released for developmental schemes proposed/identified by the concerned MNA. Likewise there is a letter dated 26th September, 2014 from the office of Chief Minister Secretariat addressed to Deputy Commissioner with the direction of the competent authority that request / demand of the president PTI for developmental schemes may be entertained out of Oil and Gas Royalty funds. Whereas the petitioner who is elected Member Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, PK-43, Hangu-2 has been deprived of his legitimate right to identify his schemes.
Record is suggestive that when these funds were not released/ allocated for the identification of schemes of the petitioner's, petitioner agitated the matter at the floor of the house and the matter was referred to the standing committee No.10, wherein the stance taken by the petitioner was acceded to, subsequently the said report of the standing committee No.10 on question No. 2375 of the petitioner was also presented in the Provincial Assembly. Record is further suggestive that the respondents gave the assurance but no practical steps were taken in this respect, therefore, a privilege motion was moved on 27.2.2015, which was referred to privilege committee and privilege No.59 was taken and it was unanimously agreed upon in the meeting of the committee and according to the directive of Chief Minister half of the fund of rupees 10 caroor and 80 lakhs was assured to be released forthwith and as such the privilege motion was delayed till the release of entire fund. Record suggests that there are number of correspondence in between petitioner, Speaker Provincial Assembly and Chief Minister, except release of rupees 108.560 million out of 10% during the financial year 2014-15 were released to Tehsil Tall PK-43.
Record is suggestive that more than 30 million rupees were approved and released by the Chief Minister to the president, Pakistan Tehreek Insaf, District Hangu, vide letter dated 17.11.2014 and rupees 108 million for the schemes identified by the MNA who also belongs to the ruling party. According to the law of land, the development funds are to be utilized through the elected representative of the constituency for provincial purposes and the MNA do not figure anywhere, what to say of office bearer/president of a ruling political party. If any funds as submitted by the petitioner, are released to the president Tehreek Insaf District Hangu, in the given circumstances amounts to a cognizable offence for the purpose of NAB Ordinance 1999 as well as Ehtesab Act, 2014.
Although petitioner has not called in question the guidelines for the release and utilization of funds from 10% Oil and Gas royalty and the formation/composition of District Development Committee at District level, however, it is observed that the same is not legally and properly constituted committee, because the public funds can only be utilized after observing legal formalities required and made mandatory under the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Establishment of District Development Advisory Committee Act, 1989, the relevant sections / clauses are as under:--
 
Clause (e) of section 2 defines the committee as:
""Committee means the District Development Advisory Committee of the District concerned, established under section 3.
 
Section 3 of the Act provides as;
3.(1) There shall be established, with immediate effect a committee to be known as the District Development Advisory Committee in each District, consisting of
(a)
 All the Members of the Provincial Assembly from the District concerned;
(b)
 Such other elected representative as the government may specify to be taken on the committee as co-opted members; and
(c)
 Such heads of Attached department at the district level as may be co-opted by the committee for their expert opinion.
(2)
 A co-opted member shall have no right of vote to exercise in any deliberation of the committee.
(3)
 The Chief Minister shall appoint one of the members to be the Chairman of the committee, who shall hold office during the pleasure of the Chief Minister.
(4)
 The committee shall take all decisions by consensus of opinion, but where such consensus is not achieved, the matter shall subject to the provision of subsection (2) be decided by majority of votes;
Provided that in case of equality of votes, the chairman shall have a second or casting vote;
Provided further that where a quota has been allocated to a Member in the development schemes of the province or the schemes approved are to be divided quota-wise, then there shall be no need for obtaining consensus of opinion regarding the allocation of projects or selection of sites, as the case may be, and it shall be the sole discretion of the member concerned to select sites or allocate projects, as the case may be, within his own quota.
(5)
 No act or proceedings of the committee shall be invalid by reason only of the existence of a vacancy in, or defect in the establishment of the Committee.
In view of above proceedings of the Provincial Assembly and assurance made and the discriminations so brought on record for the release of funds to another MPA from PK-42 of the same District, petitioner has made out a case of discrimination and victimization due to political differences and as such, this writ petition is allowed, as prayed for.
8.
 All the elected representatives have the equal right to the allocation of funds; especially the developmental funds and any deviation would be amounting to discrimination and against the fundamental and legal rights of the elected representatives and even the inhabitants of the constituency. In the comments so filed by respondent No.3 they have stated that there is no mechanism to allocate funds to Provincial Members, whereas in the comments of LG&RDD Department, it has been stated that umbrella PC-I of the scheme under ADP ""uplift of rural roads and Dir Upper and Dir Lower"" was originally approved at cost of Rs.500 million by PDWF forum and the said cost has been enhanced through Chief Minister directives by submitting revised PC-I, submitted by field offices on need basis and got approved from PDWF forum.
9.
 Admittedly, the subject scheme is umbrella in nature covering only two districts i.e District Upper and Lower and as such funds are allocated to the particular area on need basis of the same district. It has also been stated in the comments para-3 as under; moreover, the concerned MPA PK-93 has not yet identified schemes under allocation of Rs.20.00 million. Furthermore, an amount of Rs.235.642 million has been allocated for developmental schemes of PK-93 in the last 4 years."" Confirming that identification of the concerned MPA is the requirement and as such the plea of the petitioner that he was not asked for any identification rather the ongoing schemes are on the identification of ruling party office bearers and future contesting candidates seems to be correct. Even otherwise, the chart given in para-3 of the parawise comments, at page-2, clearly shows that in the constituencies PK-93 of petitioner and PK-97, which is also an opposition MPA, have been allocated less than hundred million while the constituencies i.e PK-91, 92, 94, 95, 96 are all having more than 150 million, clearly demonstrating the favoritism and nepotism. It is the bounden duty of the Government/public functionaries to function in good faith, honestly and within the parameter of its power so that person concerned should be treated in accordance with law as guaranteed by Article 4, of the constitution, which includes principles of natural justice, procedure fairness and procedure proprietary and any action, which was mala fide or colorable could not be regarded as action in accordance with law. In the case of Pir Imran Sajid and others v. Managing Director/General Manager (Manager Finance) Telephone Industries of Pakistan reported in 2015 SCMR 1257 (d), (e) & (f) it has been held as under:--
----Art. 4 & Preamble---Socio-economic justice---Scope---Whole edifice of governance of the society had its genesis in the constitution and laws aimed at to establish an order, inter alia, ensuring the provisions of socio-economic justice, so that the people may have guarantee and sense of being treated in accordance with law, and that they were not being deprived of their due rights.
----Art. 4 and Public functionaries, duty of---Natural justice---Procedural fairness and propriety---Every public functionary was supposed to function in good faith, honestly and within the precincts of its power so that person concerned should be treated in accordance with law as guaranteed by Art. 4 of the Constitution, which included principles of natural justice, procedural fairness and procedural propriety--Any action which was mala fide or colourable was not regarded as action in accordance with law.
----Arts.4 & 25-Administration authorities, duty of--Good governance---Scope of good governance could not be achieved by exercising discretionary powers unreasonably or arbitrarily and without application of mind---Such objective could be achieved by following the rules of justness, fairness and openness in consonance with the command of the Constitution enshrined in different articles including Arts. 4 & 25 of the Constitution---Obligation to act fairly on the part of the administrative authority had been evolved to ensure the rule of law and to prevent failure of the justice.
10.
 In view of the above this writ petition is allowed, as prayed for.

 LAL JAN KHATTAK, J.---
Petitioner Rehmanullah seeks his post arrest bail in case FIR No.44 dated 26.01.2017 under sections 18(b) and 22(b) of the Emigration Ordinance, 1979 of Police Station FIA, AHTC, Peshawar, wherein, he is charged for taking money from the complainant in order to send him abroad.
2.
 Arguments heard and record gone through.
3.
 A cursory look at the case record would show that in the FIR no specific date has been mentioned on which the complainant had given money to the petitioner for sending him abroad, which aspect of the case cannot be overlooked while deciding this bail petition. Furthermore, both the offences for which the petitioner stands charged are punishable with imprisonment for 14 years or with fine or with both. It is well settled that when a Statute provides two punishments simultaneously for commission of an offence, then for the purpose of bail the lesser punishment is considered by the court and there is reason for that as in case the prosecution succeeds in proving its case against the accused, then whether the court will inflict him the maximum or the minimum sentence, which aspect of the case has brought the petitioner's case within the ambit of further inquiry as there is no certainty that he will be awarded the term of imprisonment. Moreso, investigation in the case is complete and the petitioner is no more required for further investigation. Apart from the above learned counsel for the petitioner relied on case law reported as 2006 MLD 1062, 2012 YLR 1106/2511, 2014 PCr.LJ 297, 2016 YLR 355 and 2016 PCr.LJ 1238, wherein, the accused similarly charged were granted bail.
4.
 Tentative assessment of the case record would reveal that involvement of the petitioner qua his guilt in the crime needs further inquiry in terms of subsection (2) of section 497, Cr.P.C., therefore, he is entitled to the concession of bail.
5.
 For what has been discussed above, this petition is allowed and the petitioner is granted bail subject to his furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs.100,000/- with two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of learned trial court, which shall ensure that the sureties are local, reliable and men of means.

 ZAHEER-UD-DIN KAKAR, J.---
 The petitioners through this petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973 assails the validity of order dated 24.4.2017 ""the impugned order"", passed by the Special Judge, Anti-Terrorism Court-II, Quetta ""the trial Court"", whereby an application for transfer of the case was dismissed.
2.
 Precisely stated, the facts of the case are that on 17.9.2016 at about 5:15 p.m, the complainant Captain Adnan Ishaq of 74 Wing, Chiltan Rifles, lodged FIR No.264 of 2016, under Sections 337-AD, 353, 392, 511, 186, 147, 148, 149, P.P.C. read with section 7 ATA with Satellite Town Police Station, Quetta against the petitioners with the allegations that on the fateful day, he (complainant) along with other FC personnel were checking the vehicles. Meanwhile, one Land Cruiser bearing registration No.LEF-20 having black glasses, wherein three armed gunmen were present, came from western side, which was stopped and on query a permit was showed which was not acceptable. Then a person, whose name was later on known as Haji Sadiq, said that no one could stop him, thus, a quarrel took place which resulted in causing injury to sepoy Mureed Abbas and they also attempted to snatch the official weapon from sepoy Akmal. The FC personnel overpowered the petitioners and recovered different types of weapon and rounds, detail mentioned in FIR.
3.
 After completion of investigation. challan of the case was submitted before the trial Court. During pendency of the case, an application under section 23 of the ATA, 1997 was moved on behalf of the accused (petitioners). The trial Court, through order dated 26.4.2017 rejected the application, hence this petition.
4.
 Learned counsel for the petitioners contended that the impugned order passed by the trial Court is against the law; that the trial Court has mis-appreciated the facts of the case; that the provisions of section 6 of ATA, 1997 not attracted in this case; that the offences mentioned in the FIR have no nexus with the definition of section 6 of the Act. Finally, he prayed for setting aside the impugned order and transfer of the case to the ordinary Court.
5.
 We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and has gone through the available record. In order to determine as to whether an offence would fall within the ambit of section 6 of Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, it is essential to have a glance over the allegations made in the FIR, material collected during investigation and surrounding circumstances. It is also necessary to examine whether the ingredients of alleged offence have any nexus with the object of the case as contemplated under sections 6, 7 and 8 thereof. Whether a particular act is an act of terrorism or not, the motivation, object design and purpose behind the said act is to be seen. It is also to be seen as to whether the said act has created a sense of fear and insecurity in the public or in a section of the public or community or in any sect and, whether the action results in striking terror or creating fear, panic, sensation, helplessness and sense of insecurity among the people in the particular area it amounts to terror and such an action squarely falls within the ambit of section 6 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 and shall be triable by a Special Court constituted for such purpose.
6.
 Section 6 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 provides the definition of ""terrorism"". In order to better appreciate the legal position. Section 6(b) of the said Act which defines a ""terrorist act"" is reproduced as under:
""6.
 Terrorism
.---(1) In this Act, ""terrorism"" means the use or threat of action where
(a)
(b)
 The use or threat is designed to coerce and intimidate or overawe the Government or the public or a section of the public or community or sect or create a sense of fear or insecurity in society.""
7.
 A bare reading of the above quoted provision of law makes it crystal clear that Courts have only to see whether the ""terrorist act"" was such which would have the tendency to create sense of fear and insecurity in the minds of the people or any section of the society. The honourable Supreme Court in a case reported as The State through Advocate General, N.W.F.P. Peshawar v. Muhammad Shafiq PLD 2003 SC 224 has held as under:--
""We have to see the psychological impact created upon the minds of the people. It is also not necessary that the said act must have taken place within the view of general public so as to bring it within the encompass of the Act. Even an act having taken place in a barbaric and gruesome manner, if it had created fear and insecurity, would certainly come within the purview of the act.""
8.
 In the present case, the petitioners have committed offence on the main road, target was Frontier Corps officers and officials and during scuffle with the FC officials, sepoy Mureed Abbas sustained injuries and they (petitioners) also tried to snatch official weapons from FC personnel. They were overpowered and the FC personnel recovered different types of weapons and rounds from their possession. The act of the petitioners on main road created fear and insecurity to the general public. Moreover, act of the petitioners apparently involves serious violence against the members of the law enforcement agency (F.C.) as such, case prima facie falls under section 6(m) and (n) of Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, therefore, Anti-Terrorism Court has the exclusive jurisdiction to try the case, as such, we do not find merit in this petition and the same is dismissed in limine.

3,NOOR MUHAMMAD Versus SAJJAD AKHTAR,"June 12, 2017",QUETTA HIGH COURT BALOCHISTAN, Honorable Justice Abdullah Baloch ,2017 PLD 96,"JUDGMENT
 ABDULLAH BALOCH, J.---
This judgment disposes of C.P. No.96 of 2016 filed by petitioner Noor Muhammad S/o Gul Muhammad caste Baloch, resident of Turbat, against the respondents with the averments that the petitioner is allotee of plots Nos.330 and 351 in Satellite Town Turbat and the said property was allotted to him on 9th May 1996 and the petitioner has regularly deposited the installments of the said plots besides by making huge expenses on construction of a boundary wall over the plots and also having the peaceful possession of the aforesaid plots.
2.
 It is further averred from the petition of the petitioner that the respondent No.1 Sajjad Akhtar S/o Muhammad Usman filed an application (complaint) before the respondent No.4 Provincial Ombudsman (Mohtasib Balochistan) in the year 2011 wherein stated that the plot Nos. B-330 and B-351 of Satellite Town Turbat were allotted to Haji Noor Muhammad and Ghulam Sarwar respectively by the then Chairman Municipal Committee Turbat and it was alleged in the said application that the petitioner being an irrelevant person occupied these plots illegally and unlawfully, had constructed a four wall without issuing NOC in his favour for construction. It is further submitted by the petitioner that on such application of respondent No.1 the learned Ombudsman Balochsitan (respondent No.4) without issuing notice to the petitioner and without investigating the matter directed the official respondent No.2 vide its findings/decision dated 9th Apri1 2013, relevant portion whereof reproduced as under:-
Keeping in view the above there is no need of further investigation. The higher authorities of Local Government Department needs to take action against officers not fulfilling their duties properly and plots in satellite town Turbat are being occupied/encroached by irrelevant persons, be vacated and entrusted to their lawful owners. The case is closed and parties are informed accordingly.
3.
 The learned counsel for the petitioner contended that on the directions of learned Ombudsman Balochistan, the official respondents have started illegal interference in the peaceful possession of the petitioner. He further contended that even otherwise, the matter pertains to factual controversy and is a civil dispute in nature, which could not be resolved or entertained by the Ombudsman, as such, the order passed by the learned Ombudsman is without jurisdiction, void ab initio, not sustainable and liable to be set aside.
4.
 The petition was contested by the respondents Nos.1,2 and 3 wherein categorically denied the claim of the petition, Mr. Jadain Dashti, learned counsel for the respondent No.1 while arguing the case stated that basically the plots in question were allotted to Haji Noor Muhammad S/o Gul Muhammad and Ghulam Sarwar S/o Muhammad Usman by the then Chairman, Municipal Committee Turbat, which was later on occupied by the petitioner as a result whereof the respondent No.1 filed a complaint on behalf of Haji Noor Muhammad and Ghulam Sarwar allottees before the learned Ombudsman Balochistan and after proper investigation and calling of record from the concerned quarters, the learned Ombudsman passed directions to the concerned authorities to get vacate the plots from the petitioner/occupant. He further contended that against the order of Ombudsman appeal is provided, as such, Constitution Petition is not maintainable.
5.
 Mr. Saleem Baloch, learned Additional Advocate General while arguing the matter on behalf of respondents Nos.2 and 3 submitted that the respondent No.2 i,e. Municipal Committee Turbat in his Para-wise comments declared the allotments of the petitioner as fake one, while verified the allotment orders of the Haji Noor Muhammad and Ghulam Sarwar as genuine, who were represented by the respondent No.1. He further contended that against the order of Ombudsman, Constitution Petition is incompetent and the petition so filed by the petitioner is liable to be dismissed.
6.
 We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record, the moot question arised between the parties is that whether the learned Ombudsman having jurisdiction to decide the civil dispute. The learned counsel for the petitioner mainly agitated the point of jurisdiction that the Ombudsman having no jurisdiction to decide civil disputes pertaining to factual controversies while on the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent No.1 and the learned AAG raised objection on the maintainability of the petition on the ground that the order so passed by the Ombudsman within the purview of the Ordinance of 2001 could not be assailed in constitutional jurisdiction while appeal is provided under section 32 of the Ordinance of 2001 to be filed with the worthy Governor of Balochistan.
7.
 After thorough analysis of the arguments put forth before us we are of the firm opinion that so far as the contention of respondent regarding Section 29 of Ordinance of 2001 is concerned, the such provisions contained in Section 29 of Ordinance of 2001 would only apply, if the Ombudsman order is within the four corners of the law defining its jurisdiction, if there is any lack of jurisdiction, the provisions contained in Article 199 of Constitution would be attracted. It is by now settled by the Superior Courts that, where the order passed by the Ombudsman, on the face of it is repugnant to law, under which it was made or suffers from want of jurisdiction, this Court may invoke its inherent jurisdiction vested in it under the law so as to prevent injustice being done to an aggrieved person. The jurisdiction of the Ombudsman is restricted by Section 9 (1) of the Ordinance of 2001 and cannot be extended further.
8.
 It is also shocking to note that the Ombudsman while accepting the complaint of respondent No.1 without issuing notice to the petitioner. The order passed by the learned Ombudsman, without affording an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner, cannot be blessed with blanket of authenticity, being violative of universally acknowledged principle of ""Audi Alteram Partem"", which has gained much importance after insertion of Article 10-A of the Constitution. In this respect, reliance is placed to the case of ""Pakistan Cromines Limited v. The Inquiry Officer, WarRisk Insurance (Sindh Balochistan Ministry of Commerce) (1983 SCMR 1208"").
9
 It is settled principle of law that the judgment of honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan is binding on each and every organ of state by virtue of Articles 189 and 190 of the Constitution. It is also settled by now that when the basic order is without lawful authority, then the superstructure shall have to fall on the ground automatically.
10.
 Now coming to the last limb of argument advanced by the learned A A.G and counsel for the private of respondent that in presence of alternate remedy against the order passed by the Ombudsman by way of appeal under section 32 of the Ordinance of 2001, this petition is not maintainable. We are of the considered view though ordinarily, when alternate remedy is available, the constitution petition is not maintainable, but in the cases, where the order impugned is patently illegal and without jurisdiction, the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court cannot be abridged on account of availability of alternate remedy, rather this Court, being custodian of fundamental rights of the citizens of the country, is under obligation to take care of the orders passed by the executives and Quasi judicial forums, when the same are brought before it in the constitution petition. In this regard, reference can be made to the cases of ""Muslim Abad Cooperative Housing Society Limited v. M/s Siddiqa Faiz ( PLD 2008 Supreme Court 135) and M/s Ahmed Clinic v. Government of Sindh 2003 CLC 1196, it was held by the Honorable Supreme Court that the High Court will not entertain a writ petition when other appropriate remedy is available is not a rule of law barring jurisdiction, but a rule by which the Court regulates it jurisdiction. When statutory functionary with mala fide or in impartial, unjust and oppressive manner, the High Court in exercise of its writ jurisdiction has power to grant relief to the aggrieved party.
11.
 Although the Court exercising writ jurisdiction cannot claim in the exercise of constitutional power to usurp the functions of the authority on which the power had been vested, but the Court exercising writ jurisdiction can insist for being satisfied that the action taken is not mere a colorable power. Even otherwise, as already observed hereinabove, neither the petitioner arrayed as party by the respondent No.1 in his application/complaint, nor did the Ombudsman bother to give notice to him to join the proceedings, prior to passing the impugned order.
12.
 In view of the above discussion, we accept this Constitution petition and declare that impugned order passed by the Ombudsman to have been without lawful authority, void ab initio and of no legal effect as such, the matter pertaining to a civil dispute and the parties are left at liberty to invoke the Court of competent jurisdiction for redressal of their grievances. No order as to costs.

 JAWAD HASSAN, J.---
Through this appeal, the Appellants have called in question the order rendered in W.P. No.31061/2014 dated 22.01.2015 passed by the learned Single Judge (the ""Impugned Order""), whereby the constitutional petition of the Respondent was allowed.
2.
 Brief facts for the disposal of instant appeal are that earlier the Respondent filed W.P. No.22214/2011 for provision of electricity connection to his premises which was remitted to the Appellants vide order dated 13.09.2012 with a direction to look into the grievance of the Respondent. The Appellants refused the request of the Respondent vide order dated 25.03.2013 for the reason that his residence is situated in Housing Scheme Gulshan-e-Azeem Sialkot. Feeling aggrieved by the said order the Respondent filed W.P. No.31061/2014 which was allowed vide the impugned order. Hence, this Appeal.
3.
 Learned counsel for the Appellants submitted that the impugned order is against law and facts as the same has been passed by ignoring the fact that providing the electricity connection to the Respondent whose resident is situated at Link Burj Road, Mian Sialkot Daska Road (the ""Property"") i.e. within the Housing Society, is totally against the policy of GEPCO Limited unless the entire Housing Society is not electrified; that the running of 11KV system close to the Housing Society is not ground for providing electricity to an individual.
4.
 On the other hand learned counsel for the Respondent submitted that the writ petition has rightly been allowed as there is no illegality in the impugned order. Learned counsel also contended that to enjoy the facility of electricity is right to every citizen of Pakistan including the Respondent and that too when the same has been provided to the other persons of the locality; that he has been provided the connection by the SNGPL of the gas supply; that no one can be deprived from his/her fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the ""Constitution""), as such the instant Appeal is liable to be dismissed.
5.
 We have heard the arguments of the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the record.
6.
 From the perusal of record it reveals that the Respondent has appended with the writ petition copy of application dated 01.08.2011 for Domestic Three Phase Connection, in which he specifically mentioned that his house is not situated in any Housing Society; that a number of electricity connections have already been provided to many of the inhabitants of the locality; that he has been provided connection of sui gas; that he is ready to bear all the expenditures that may occur. The Respondent has also appended along with the petition copy of NOC issued by the Tehsil Municipal Administration showing no objection on provision of electricity connection to the Respondent as the residential building plan has been approved by the TMA. The perusal of record further depicts that in the application dated 21.05.2014 given to the Chief Executive Officer, GEPCO the Respondent has mentioned that he has purchased the land from Zarqa Qayyum, a private owner of the land and that the sponsors of the alleged colony could never get preliminary NOC from the TMA Sialkot during the last ten (10) years nor they are interested to make a housing scheme. Record further reveals that the said Colony is under objection which has not been removed so far.
7.
 From the above, it is crystal clear that the residential building plan of the Respondent has been approved by the TMA and they have no objection on provision of electricity connection. It is noticeable here that the TMA vide letter dated 09.05.2014 has stated that the residential building plan of the Respondent has been approved but vide letter dated 08.11.2014, showing the status of the said Gulshan Azeem Colony Daska Road, Sialkot, has stated that the approval of the Society is pending due to objections duly conveyed to applicants on 08.08.2009 but the applicants have not cleared the objections hence the layout plan is unapproved yet. The status of pendency is also conveyed to Government for information. From the above, it is explicit that the approval of the society has not been given by the TMA. In the report and parawise comments the Appellants have mentioned that it has passed the order in terms of its Policy of the Department, whereby in a housing society, if the electrification is not connected by the sponsors, the electric connection cannot be sanctioned in favour of the individual consumer. It means that it is the Policy of the Respondents-Department that without electrification in a housing society, no individual is allowed to have an electricity connection, separately. But in the present case the situation is different, as admittedly, the alleged housing society has not yet been approved/registered by the Authority, as such does not have the status of a 'Housing Society'. The Respondent has also produced letter dated 22.04.2015, issued by the Tehsil Municipal Administra-tion, Sialkot, through which the Respondent has been intimated that the plan of subject colony submitted by Ch. Azeem Safdar and others in TMA Sialkot has been rejected by this office, therefore, the Respondent cannot be refused supplying electricity connection because there exists no housing society and the said policy cannot have its effect upon the case of the Appellant.
8.
 The order dated 13.04.2017 passed by this Court in the instant Appeal reveals that in compliance of this Court's order the demand notice dated 12.04.2017 amounting to Rs.2,40,500/- has been delivered to the Appellants/Department in the Court, therefore, now the Respondent cannot be denied from issuance of electricity connection as a substantial right has been accrued in his favour. Undeniably, the Respondent is the citizen of this country and the Constitution guarantees fundamental rights to every citizen. This Court is meant to protect and enforcement of the fundamental rights of the citizens which are being infringed by anyone. To enjoy the facility of electricity is fundamental right of the all the citizens under the Constitution and particularly, in the present era when life seems to be impossible without electricity. The Respondent has given application for Domestic Three Phase Connection for his house which is admittedly his fundamental right, as such the learned Single Judge has rightly observed in the impugned order that to provide electricity to the Respondent is his fundamental right which cannot be denied in any manner and has also placed reliance on the case titled Mehar Muhammad Nawaz, Ex-OG-I, Small Business Finance Corporation Multan v. Managing Director, Small Business Finance Corporation and 2 others 2009 SCMR 187.
9.
 We fully agree with the finding of the learned single Judge who allowed the petition directing the appellants to provide electricity connection to the Respondent's premises as it is his fundamental right. In view of above circumstances, we see no illegality or jurisdictional error in the impugned order which has been passed in line with the dictates of law and does not warrant any interference by this Division Bench.
10.
 Resultantly, the instant Appeal is devoid of any merit and is accordingly dismissed.

5,ABDUL HAMEED Versus State,"June 12, 2017",KARACHI HIGH COURT SINDH, Honorable Justice Adnan-ul-Karim Memon ,2018 YLRN 75,"ORDER
 ADNAN-UL-KARIM MEMON, J.---
The Applicants namely Abdul Hameed Shaikh and Danish Gul Chandio are seeking Post Arrest Bail in a case Crime No.41/2017, under section 285, 286, P.P.C. and Section 3/4 Prohibition (Enforcement of Had) Order 1979, registered at Police Station Taluka, District Larkana. Applicants moved bail application twice in above crime before learned Judicial Magistrate-Ill, Larkana and the same were dismissed vide order dated 15.4.2017 and 28.4.2017 respectively. Thereafter, Applicants moved bail applications twice before learned Sessions Judge, Larkana which were also dismissed vide order dated 19.4.2017 and 20.5.2017 respectively.
2.
 The gist of allegations against the Applicants according to the FIR is that on 12.04.2017 ASI Abdul Sattar Khatyan of Police Station Taluka, Larkana alongwith subordinate staff i.e. PC-Oshaq Ahmed and PC-Hakim Ali were on patrol duty. During patrolling, when they reached Indus Highway Larkana, they received spy information about one Blue Car carrying certain objectionable material. Upon seeing the said car, they signaled to stop, search was conducted and found one person sitting on the rear seat of car with packets of explosives comprising of 1400 boxes in 4 sacks and three cartons containing 60(20 bottles in each carton) tin bottles of beer/alcohol respectively. The aforesaid recovered items were sealed and secured under Mushirnama. On inquiry, the driver of car disclosed his name as Abdul Hameed son of Akbar Ali Shaikh, resident of Shaikh Muhalla, Kamber. The person who was sitting on rear seat of car disclosed his name as Danish Gul son of Ali Gul Chandio, resident of Kamber Ali Khan. Accused persons and recovered property were brought at Police Station and FIR was lodged under Section 285,286 of PPC and Section 3/4 Prohibition (Enforcement of Had) Order, 1979 on behalf of the State.
3.
 Investigating Officer of the case prepared Mushirnama of place of incident, recorded statements of prosecution witnesses, interrogated the Applicants, got conducted chemical examination of recovered alcohol, obtained its report and submitted Charge Sheet against the Applicants on 20.04.2017.
4.
 Learned counsel for the Applicants argued that Applicants have falsely been implicated in the subject crime by the police with mala fide intention by concocting a story due to enmity. It is further asserted that Applicants are students who have no criminal record. They further added that nothing was recovered from the possession of Applicants and the /alleged recovery is foisted upon them. They next contended that there is /a violation of section 103 Cr.P.C. as no private person has been cited as witness from the Area where the alleged recovery was made despite the fact that place of incident is a very thickly populated area. Therefore, the case requires further inquiry to ascertain the guilt of the Applicants. They further argued that offences are not punishable with death or imprisonment for life. They next contended that section 3 Prohibition (Enforcement of Hadd) Order,1979 is not applicable in the present case, section 4 of Prohibition of (Enforcement of Hadd) Order,1979 is punishable up to two years and offences under Section 285 and 286 PPC are bailable, therefore Applicants are entitled for the concession of Bail as matter of right. The learned counsel for the Applicants in support of their contentions has placed reliance upon the case of Shah Nawaz and others v. The State (2008 SCMR 1436), Muhammad Ummer v. The State (PLD 2004 SC 477), Saeed Ahmed v. The State (1996 SCMR 1132), Munawar Hussain Talat v. The State (2005 YLR 1215)and Muhammad Siddiq v. The State (1988 PCr.LJ 947).Per learned counsel in the light of the aforesaid case law the punishment provided for the alleged offences is less than three years, which becomes bailable. Therefore, the case of Applicants does not fall within the prohibitory clause of section 497(1) of Cr.P.C. Learned counsel further asserted that alleged recovered case property i.e. tin bottles of beer/alcohol were sent for chemical analysis after considerable delay of five days without any plausible explanation. Therefore, the Chemical Examination Report has lost the presumption of authenticity and cannot be considered at bail stage.
5.
 Learned Addl. Prosecutor General for the State has opposed the grant of bail and argued that Applicants were arrested at the spot while transporting 1400 boxes of explosives packed in 4 sacks and three cartons containing 20 each tin bottles of ::,eer/ alcohol. He next argued that Chemical Examination Report and statements of witnesses fully supported the prosecution case. He next contended that Applicants have been charged with offences punishable under Section 3/4 Prohibition (Enforcement of Hadd) Order, 1979 read with sections 285 and 286, P.P.C. which are of serious nature. He next argued that Applicants are charged with allegations of transport and possession of explosive material and 60 tin bottles of beer/Alcohol containing 6.5 % V/V Ethyl Alcohol in huge quantity. He next contended that Prosecution has collected sufficient incriminating evidence against the Applicants and if the bail is granted the Applicants will continue to commit similar criminal activities causing harm to the public at large. Therefore, the Applicants are not entitled to the concession of bail. In support of his contentions he relied upon the case of IMTIAZ AHMED and others v. THE STATE (PLD 1997 SC 545). He further added that learned Trial Court rejected bail applications of the Applicants twice on merits vide order dated 15.4.2017 and 28.4.2017 respectively, as well as learned Sessions Court, Larkana vide respective orders dated 19.4.2017 and 20.5.2017.
6.
 I have heard learned counsel for the Applicants and learned Addl. P.G. for the State, perused the material available on record and case law cited at the Bar.
7.
 I am conscious of the fact that while deciding a bail application, 1 this Court has to consider the allegations made in the FIR, statements /recorded under section 161, Cr.P.C., nature and gravity of charge, other incriminating material against the accused, legal pleas raised by the accused and the relevant law.
8.
 Record reflects that Applicants have been arrested red-handed with 1400 boxes of explosive material packed in total 4 sacks and sixty tin bottles of beer/Alcohol. Per Chemical Examination Report, the aforesaid material/parcel contains 6.5% V/V as Ethyl Alcohol. The recovery of above specified explosive substance and alcohol was duly witnessed by police officials. The perusal of record does not reflect any ostensible reason on the part of police which could indicate false implication of the Applicants. Therefore, police official are as good witnesses as any other person.
9.
 Insofar as the plea taken by the learned counsel for the Applicants with respect to non-association of private witnesses is concerned, the complainant has explained the same in the FIR that incident took place at odd hours of the night. And, plea of enmity is a factual controversy which cannot be looked into at bail stage, as deeper appreciation of I; evidence is not required to be considered at bail stage because only tentative assessment of the record is to be made.
10.
 Prima facie the offence falls under Section 3 and 4 Prohibition;. (Enforcement of Hadd) Order, 1979 read with section 285 and 286, P.P.C. and section 3 is punishable up to five years imprisonment, which are of serious nature. Apparently, sufficient incriminating material has been collected by the police against the Applicants.
11.
 It is well settled principle of law that an offence which does not fall/within the prohibitory clause of section 497(1), Cr.P.C. does not become a bailable offence automatically. Therefore, if the circumstances warrant bail can be refused even in respect of offences not falling under the prohibitory clause of section 497(1), Cr.P.C.
12.
 The case law cited by the learned counsel for the Applicants are distinguishable from the facts and circumstances of the present case.
13.
 In view of the above, I am of the opinion that Applicants have failed to make out a case for grant of bail at this stage. Accordingly, the instant bail application is dismissed.
14.
 The findings mentioned above are tentative in nature which shall not prejudice the case of either party at the trial stage. However, the learned Trial Court is directed to record evidence of the material witnesses within a period of two months where after the Applicants will be at liberty to move fresh bail application before the learned Trial Court on fresh ground, if they so desire.
15.
 Above are the reasons of short order dated 06.6.2017.

6,ZAHID HUSSAIN Versus State,"June 12, 2017",PESHAWAR HIGH COURT, Honorable Justice Abdul Shakoor ,2018 YLRN 147,"ORDER
 ABDUL SHAKOOR, J.---
Petitioner, Zahid Hussain, seeks his release on bail in case FIR No.362 dated 14.05.2017 under sections 15-AA/5 Explosive registered at Police Station, Daudzai, Peshawar.
2.
 The brief facts of the case are that on 14.05.2017 at 2030 hours, the complainant, Syed Sardar Ali Shah, SHO Police Station Daudzai was on combining operation in the, area, he also conducted raid at the house of one Ijaz son of Mir Ahmad Shah, who is a proclaimed offender in case FIR No.69 dated 27.1.2017 registered under sections 302/ 324/34, P.P.C. of Police Station, Daudzai, Peshawar was wanted by the police, but the said P.O. was not found at his house, however, the police party found the present accused/ petitioner in the house of said P.O. The personal search of the accused/petitioner led to the recovery of a 9 MM Pistol bearing No.013008-10-CN-236 loaded along with 26 live rounds of the same bore and 03 hand grenades. The accused/ petitioner could not produce any valid license or permit for carrying the said deadly weapons and explosives, hence the FIR.
3.
 The learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the accused/ petitioner is innocent and has falsely been implicated in the case with ulterior motive by the police; Further contended that under Section 7 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908 permission of the Provincial Government must be obtained but in the instant case no permission has yet been obtained. Further submitted that there is no mentioned serial numbers with regard to hand grenades; that there is no independent evidence against the accused/petitioner on the file as required under section 103, Cr.P.C.; Learned counsel for petitioner further argued that the accused/petitioner is first offender and never involved previously in such like cases; and that the charge levelled against the accused/petitioner requires further probe into his guilt and as such, he is entitled to the concession of bail. Learned counsel for the petitioner placed reliance on case titled Shah Zaman v. The State (2012 MLD 410), Habib-ur-Rehman v. The State (2012 YLR 665), Zain-ul-Abidin v. The State (2010 MLD 173) and Karamat Khan v. The State (2011 YLR 1390).
4.
 On the other hand, the learned AAG on behalf of State opposed the arguments of learned counsel for the petitioner and contended that the accused/ petitioner is directly charged in the FIR and recovery has been effected from his personal possession. Further contended that the offence, with which the petitioner is charged heinous in nature and also falls within the prohibitory clause of section 497, Cr.P.C. In these circumstances, the accused/petitioner is not entitled to the concession of bail.
5.
 I have heard learned counsel for the petitioner, learned AAG on behalf of State and perused the available record with their assistance.
6.
 Perusal of record would show that no permission/sanction from the Provincial Government/ competent authority is available on record, as required under Section 7 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908, for holding a trial in the case of accused/petitioner, which is mandatory. The record would further reveal that no public witness of the locality as required under section 103, Cr.P.C. was associated with the recovery proceedings. The Expert report is also not available on record to ascertain as to whether the recovered arms and ammunition were in working condition or not. The recovery of three hand grenades from one side pocket is also intolerable/impossible and also no serial number has been mentioned of the said hand grenades and thus case of the accused/petitioner is made out that of further inquiry. Besides, the petitioner is behind the bars since his arrest and there is no prospect of conclusion of his trial in the near future.
7.
 For the reasons discussed above, the instant bail application is allowed and the accused/petitioner is admitted to bail subject to furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs.2,00,000/- with two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate. The sureties must be reliable and men of means.
8.
 Above are the reasons of my short order of even date.

7,MUJAHID HUSSAIN NAQVI Versus AZAD JAMMU AND KASHMIR BAR COUNCIL,"June 12, 2017",HIGH COURT AZAD KASHMIR, Honorable Justice M. Tabassum Aftab Alvi ,2017 PLD 59,"JUDGMENT
 M. TABASSUM AFTAB ALVI, C.J.---
The supra titled writ petition has been addressed under Section 44 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act, 1974 whereby vires of the impugned notification dated 05th April, 2017, through which license of Advocacy of petitioner was cancelled by the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Bar Council, on the basis of stricture made by the apex Court through its order dated 21st March, 2017, has been challenged for having been issued as without lawful authority.
2.
 Precise facts culminating into filing of the instant writ petition are that petitioner was enrolled as an Advocate of the High Court on 14th September, 1981. After completing prescribed period of practice, he was enrolled as an Advocate of the Supreme Court on 23rd July, 1983. The apex Court previously referred the matter of misconduct of petitioner to the Bar Council under Section 38 by suspending his legal practice while exercising powers under Section 51 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Bar Council Act, 1995, through judgment dated 11th May, 2010. However, as Disciplinary Committee could not dispose off complaint within a period of 03 months, therefore, order of suspension pertaining to legal practice of petitioner was declared as vacated by afflux of time, by the apex Court through order dated 2nd May, 2011. The petitioner moved an application before the Supreme Court, in Review Petition No.2/2016, titled ""Mujahid Hussain Naqvi v. Azad Govt. and others"" for adjournment on the ground of ailment, stating therein, that his brain activity reduced to 75%, however, certain observations were passed against him by the apex Court through order dated 21st March, 2017. The matter was, however, referred to Bar Council and consequently on the basis of observations made by the Supreme Court, license of petitioner was abrogated by the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Bar Council, through the impugned notification dated 05th April, 2017. Against the aforesaid impugned notification petitioner previously filed Writ Petition No.721/2017 and impleaded parties to Hon'ble Senior Judge of the Supreme Court, as well as Registrar of the Supreme Court, as respondents Nos.6 and 7, in the said writ petition. The single Bench of this Court solicited comments with show cause from all respondents through order dated 26th April, 2017, however later on, when the aforesaid fact came in the notice of the Bench seized with the matter that Hon'ble Judge of the Supreme Court was also impleaded party by name, the said writ petition was returned in original to petitioner vide order dated 27th April, 2017, hence, the instant subsequent writ petition.
3.
 The petitioner himself argued case and submitted that Azad Jammu and Kashmir Bar Council, issued the impugned notification dated 05th April, 2017, whereby his license of advocacy was unlawfully abrogated on the basis of order of the Supreme Court without providing him an opportunity of hearing. He contended that through order dated 21st March, 2017, the apex Court only referred the matter to Bar Council for detailed report, however, the Bar Council, cancelled his license in colorable exercise of powers in hasty manner, hence, submitted for admission of writ petition.
4.
 We have perused the contents of writ petition and examined the appended documents as well as service record of petitioner made available with utmost care.
5.
 A perusal of record reveals that Hon'ble Senior Puisne Judge, of the apex Court passed following stricture against petitioner through order dated 21st March, 2017:-
3. Mr. Mujahid Hussain Naqvi, advocate, petitioner, has moved an application for seeking adjournment on the ground of ailment. The relevant contents of the application read as under:-
""That the petitioner who is a known patient of 'reactive depression' owing to having remained constantly in stress-oriented atmosphere since 6th March, 2017 has undergone a recurrent attack of the ailment. And has been constrained to restart heavy intoxicating drugs, which keep his brain drowsy and half asleep. Resultantly his brain activity goes reduced to 75%. He is thus not in a befitting position to appear before the Hon'ble Court and participate in proceedings sharply and with full effectiveness.""
After going through the contents of the application, Mr. Raza Ali Khan, the learned Advocate-General, who is also the Chairman of AJ&K Bar Council, was called to the rostrum to apprise the Court, who stated that according to his information, Mr. Mujahid Hussain Naqvi is not holding valid license of the AJ&K Bar Council. After such statement by the Chairman Bar Council, the position has become more aggravate, which requires thorough probe in the light of the provisions of Legal Practitioners and Bar Council Act, 1995. I would also like to observe here that in a number of cases, Mr. Mujahid Hussain Naqvi, Advocate, has moved such like applications. Yesterday, in a case titled Mujahid Hussain Naqvi v. Ansr Mehmood Awan and others, he also moved an application wherein he mentioned that his brain activity has reduced to 75%. From the previous record/ pleadings of Mr. Mujahid Hussain Naqvi it depicts that he mostly used contemptuous/scandalizing language to undermine the authority of the Court, which is not expected from a lawyer. I am of the view that this may be due to his ailment, which is supported by different medical certificates/applications submitted by him in different cases. However, to his latest stance taken in the application alarming and serious which cannot be taken lightly. In this scenario, his further continuation in legal profession does not appear to be in the interest of legal profession.""
 'Underlining is ours for emphasizing.
6.
 It appears from the impugned notification dated 05th April, 2017, that license of petitioner was cancelled by the Bar Council, on the basis of the aforesaid stricture of the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The petitioner impliedly challenged the vires of the aforesaid observations through the instant constitution petition. We are afraid, the stricture supra, on the basis of which, the impugned notification was issued cannot be expunged by this Court, hence, writ petition is not maintainable. The petitioner could prefer a review petition before the apex Court against the aforesaid observations for expunging the remarks, within 30 days as per the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Supreme Court Rules, 1978.
7.
 A perusal of memorandum of writ petition reveals that petitioner impleaded Shoukat Ali Kiyani, Advocate/Vice Chairman Bar Council, Chaudhary Khalid Yousaf, Advocate, Chairman Executive Committee Bar Council, Registrar Supreme Court of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Chairman Disciplinary Committee, Azad Jammu and Kashmir Bar Council as respondents Nos. 3, 4, 6 and 7, respectively. No any reasons whatsoever, has been shown that why the aforesaid respondents have been impleaded in the line of respondents. The petitioner previously filed Writ Petition No.721/2017 and impleaded Hon'ble Senior Puisne Judge of the Supreme Court, as well as Registrar of the Supreme Court, as respondents Nos.6 and 7, which petition was returned in original to him vide order dated 27th April, 2017. The petitioner again impIeaded the same Hon'ble Senior Puisne Judge, who recorded judgment dated 09th October, 2012, through which Government notification dated 09th May, 1998, pertaining to dismissal from service of petitioner was restored, whose lordship is Chairman of Disciplinary Committee, in the line of respondents without any lawful justification. It is an admitted fact that no proceedings were ever initiated by Chairman Disciplinary Committee against petitioner, therefore, writ petition merits dismissal due to mis-joinder of parties, hence, we are not inclined to exercise our extraordinary constitutional jurisdiction in favour of petitioner.
8.
 As per service record of petitioner, he was Secretary to Government BPS-20, however, on the ground of committing forgery and tampering in orders of the Prime Minister, was reverted from BPS-20 to BPS-19,. and then in BPS-18 to BPS-17 and lastly he was reverted as Information Officer BPS-16, and ultimately was dismissed from service vide Government notification dated 09th May, 1998. Against the aforesaid Govt. notification, petitioner filed Writ Petition No.215/1998, titled ""Mujahid Husain Naqvi v. Azad Govt. and others"", before this Court, which was accepted vide order dated 05th October, 1999. Against the aforesaid order, Azad Government and others filed an appeal before the apex Court, in which difference of opinion arose between two Hon'ble Judges of the Supreme Court, resultantly, matter was placed before third Judge, who was at the then time, the Hon'ble Chief Justice (Mr. Justice Sardar Said Muhammad Khan). The appeal filed by Government and others was accepted vide judgment dated 09th October, 2012. He later on moved an application for recalling judgment dated 09th October, 2012, which was also turned down by the apex Court through order dated 05th December, 2015. Meanwhile petitioner succeeded to obtain an order dated 26th October, 2014, from the Prime Minister for reinstatement in Service, then promotion in BPS-21 since 02nd December, 1997 and then retirement on reaching superannuation w.e.f. 27th September, 2009. The order was not acted upon, hence, he filed Writ Petition No.2277/2014, titled ""Mujahid Hussain Naqvi v. Azad Govt. and others"" which was dismissed by Division Bench of this Court handed down by me (Justice M. Tabassum Aftab Alvi, C.J.) with the other member of Bench (Justice Muhammad Sheraz Kiani, J.) vide judgment dated 08th June, 2017. In this regard paragraphs 9, 10 and 11 of the said judgment are reproduced as follows:-
""9. A perusal of application of petitioner reveals that petitioner has deliberately concealed the judgment of the apex Court dated 09.10.2012, and by suppressing fact succeeded to obtain a void order of his reinstatement and promotion in BPS-21 since 02.12.1997, as well as retirement after attaining age of superannuation w.e.f 27.09.2009, who has not invoked jurisdiction of this Court with clean hands, therefore, is not entitled to equitable relief of writ jurisdiction.
10. The petitioner, therefore, filed the instant writ petition with unclean hands which is ex-facie frivolous, as well as, contemptuous to frustrate the judgment and order of the apex Court of the country.
11. The contention of petitioner that he remained almost unconscious from 2010 to 2015, seems to be falsified. A perusal of judgment of the apex Court dated 09.10.2012, makes it abundantly clear that he himself argued his case and pleaded each and every point pertaining to prove his dismissal order as unlawful and each point was authoritatively resolved by the apex Court of the country. He later on also moved an application for recalling judgment dated 09.10.2012, which too was argued by him. The application was turned down by the Hon'ble Court through order dated 05.12.2015, which proved that his assertion about unconsciousness since 2010 to 2015. is falsified. Even otherwise the aforesaid point has not been raised by petitioner in memorandum of his writ petition. It is well settled principle of law that a party cannot be allowed to argue its case vis-a-vis to pleadings ..""
9.
 The petitioner concealed the aforesaid fact of his dismissal from service from the Bar Council, who as per Section 24 subsection (2) of AJ&K Legal Practitioner and Bar Council Act, 1995, could not be allowed to practice as lawyer, for five years, which is reproduced as follow: -
 ""24. Persons qualified for admissions as Advocates
:- (1)
 (a) ..
 (b) .
 (c) .
 
 (i) 
 
 (ii) ..
 
 (iii) .
 (d) 
 (e) 
 (2) A person shall be disqualified from being admitted as an advocate if:-
(i) he was dismissed or removed from service of Government or of a public statutory corporation or a charge involving moral turpitude; unless a period of five years, or such less period as the Government may, by notification in the official Gazette, specify in this behalf, has elapsed since his dismissal or removal; or
 (ii) 
 (iii) ..
 (3) ..
10.
 The petitioner, therefore, remained in the legal profession till cancellation of his license vide notification (sic) dismissed Civil Servant, hence, is not entitled to equitable relief of writ jurisdiction even from this angle.
11.
 The petitioner obtained license to practice in the Judicature of High Court of Azad Jammu and Kashmir on 14th September, 1981, while obtained license of the Supreme Court on 23rd July, 1983. The Azad Jammu and Kashmir Bar Council Act, 1995, was promulgated on 31st December, 1995. At the time of promulgation of the Act, 1995, petitioner was a Civil Servant, hence, was not practicing Advocate. As per record, he was dismissed from service, vide Govt. notification dated 09th May, 1998. After dismissal from service and promulgation of Act, 1995, it appears that he never informed to the Bar Council about his dismissal from service. It reflects that name of petitioner was never inserted in the roll of Advocates maintained by the Bar Council, in accordance with provisions of Sections 21(a), 22(a) and 23(a) of the Act, 1995. Therefore, according to our considered view, petitioner is not entitled to practice in the legal profession till completion of statutory period as postulated under subsection (2) of Section 24 of Act, 1995.
12.
 The legal profession is known as a noble profession having high traditions and has been catering to the need of the society for a very long time past. Thus, the members of legal fraternity are expected to uphold those traditions and serve the society with utmost respect to Courts, sincerely and honestly. If such are the expectations from a noble profession, its members must conduct themselves which may be worthy of emulation. By doing any act which is contrary to the accepted norms and standards of the aforesaid professions, a member of the legal fraternity not only discredits himself but also brings disrepute to the profession to which he belongs. By such acts the credibility and reputation of the profession as a whole comes under cloud. If any member of the profession falls from such standards, he deserves punishment commensurate with the gravity of misconduct. The conduct of petitioner even before this Court in numberless cases also displayed that his further continuation in legal profession does not appear to be in the interest of legal profession.

 SYED MANSOOR ALI SHAH, C.J.---
This judgment will decide the maintainability of the instant petition, as well as, connected Writ Petition No.23578/2016.
2.
 Petitioner has challenged the constitutionality of the geographical allocation of quotas amongst Provinces and other Areas in the national Competitive Examination of the Central Superior Services (CSS) 2015. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that allocation of quota to various Provinces and Areas is in violation of Article 27 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. It is submitted that the period envisaged in the proviso to Article 27(1) i.e., forty years from the commencing day, has long expired and, therefore, the geographical quotas allocated for CSS-2015 by the Federal Public Service Commission (FPSC) vide Press Note dated 13.04.2016 are unconstitutional and illegal.
3.
 At the very outset, M/s Nasar Ahmed, DAG, Anwaar Hussain, Additional Advocate General, Amanullah Kanrani, Advocate General, Balochistan, Syed Ali Raza, Advocate General, AJK and Malik Akhtar Hussain Awan, Assistant Advocate General, KPK raised a preliminary objection regarding the maintainability of the titled petition. They submitted that any interference by this Court would amount to issuing a writ outside the territorial limits of the Court, in as much as, it will affect the rights and privileges (quota) of people belonging to other Provinces and Areas, which is not permissible under Article 199 of the Constitution. They also oppose the main case on merits but that need not be gone into at this stage.
4.
 Messrs Kh. Isaam Bin Haris and Mushtaq Ahmad Mohal Advocates, appearing on behalf of the petitioners submitted that the impugned Press Note has been issued by the Federal Government and there are numerous instances when notifications issued by the Federation and even the federal laws are challenged before this Court and often struck down. Therefore, this Court can also examine the impugned Press Note, which is no different. They placed reliance on Ahmad Yar Chohan v. Federal Public Service Commission and 2 others (1998 MLD 1832) and Mushtaq Ahmad Mohal and others v. The Honourable Lahore High Court, Lahore and others (1997 SCMR 1043) in support of their contentions.
5.
 Considering the gravity of the constitutional question, notices were issued to the Advocates General of other provinces to solicit their viewpoint. Amanullah Kanrani, AG, Balochistan Syed Ali Raza, Advocate General, AJK and Malik Akhtar Hussain Awan, Assistant Advocate General, KPK have tendered appearance and submitted that it would be constitutionally appropriate if the matter is taken up by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan. They submitted that this Court cannot issue a writ affecting the rights or quotas of the people or residents of another Province.
 Mr. Rafey Altaf, Advocate/amicus curiae submits that this Court has jurisdiction to entertain the matter. He submits that in terms of Article 199(2) of the Constitution this Court cannot shy away from enforcing the Constitution. He placed reliance on Messrs Sethi and Sethi Sons through Humayun Khan v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Islamabad and others (2012 PTD 1869), K.B. Threads (Pvt.) Limited through Chief Executive and others v. Zila Nazim, Lahore (Amir Mehmood) and others (PLD 2004 Lahore 376) and High Court Bar Association and others v. Government of Balochistan through Secretary, Home and Tribal Affairs Department and 6 others (PLD 2013 Balochistan 75).
7.
 Mr. Saad Rasool, Advocate/amicus curiae submits that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain this matter as it amounts to transgressing its territorial jurisdiction. He submits that any interference by this Court would take away quota allocated to other Provinces, which is not within the jurisdiction of this Court and can best be dealt with by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan.
8.
 I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and the learned amici curiae. The case law cited at the bar and the relevant provisions of the Constitution have been examined. Preliminary objection regarding maintainability of this petition raises an important constitutional question i.e., Whether the High Court while granting relief to people within its own territorial jurisdiction can simultaneously affect the rights and privileges enjoyed by people in other Provinces? Whether, in such a unique situation, issuance of a writ by this Court is impermissible (hence not maintainable) or inappropriate?

 The above Press Note allocates quota to four Provinces, Gilgit Baltistan, FATA and AJK for the purposes of CSS Examination-2015. It is important to underline that the Press Note lays down a national quota allocation scheme. This allocation cannot be read in isolation for Punjab. 50% quota allocated to Punjab is not separable and cannot be sliced away without affecting the ratios allocated to other Provinces and Areas. The countrywide quota system envisaged in the Press Note is inter-linked and together constitutes a total of 100%. This is a unique case, where any intervention by this Court would upset the equilibrium of national quota system structured for CSS-Examination 2015 and affect the rights and privileges of the people of other Provinces, having smaller quotas.
10.
 What is the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 199? Article 175 states that there shall be a High Court for each Province and no court shall have any jurisdiction save as is or may be conferred on it by the Constitution or by or under any law. The jurisdiction conferred on the High Court under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 is as under:-
199. Jurisdiction of High Court
.---(1) Subject to the Constitution, a High Court may, if it is satisfied that no other adequate remedy is provided by law,--
(a)
 on the application of any aggrieved party, make an order---
(i)
 directing a person performing, within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court, functions in connection with the affairs of the Federation, a Province or a local authority, to refrain from doing anything he is not permitted by law to do, or to do anything he is required by law to do; or
(ii)
 declaring that any act done or proceeding taken within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court by a person performing functions in connection with the affairs of the Federation, a Province or a local authority has been done or taken without lawful authority and is of no legal effect; or
(b)
 on the application of any person, make an order 
(i)
 directing that a person in custody within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court be brought before it so that the Court may satisfy itself that he is not being held in custody without lawful authority or in an unlawful manner; or
(ii)
 requiring a person within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court holding or purporting to hold a public office to show under what authority of law he claims to hold that office; or
(c)
 on the application of any aggrieved person, make an order giving such directions to any person or authority, including any Government exercising any power or performing any function in, or in relation to, any territory within the jurisdiction of that Court as may be appropriate for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights conferred by Chapter 1 of Part II. (emphasis supplied)
Article 201 provides that any decision of a High Court to the extent it decides a question of law or is based upon or enunciates a principle of law shall be binding on all courts subordinate to it. Similarly, Article 202 provides that the High Court may make rules regulating the practice and procedure of any court subordinate to it. While Article 203 provides that High Court shall supervise and control all courts subordinate to it.
11.
 Constitutional terms like ""High Court for each Province"" ""within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court"" and ""all courts subordinate to it"" construct a High Court, which has a provincial character. The term ""within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court"" ubiquitously recurs throughout Article 199 emphasizing the territorial limitation on the jurisdiction of a High Court. The term ""All courts subordinate to it"" repeated in Articles 201, 202 and 203 place the Provincial High Court atop a provincial pyramidical hierarchy of courts. Constitutional architecture of a Provincial High Court provides that while it enjoys judicial power to examine all laws or actions of the federal, provincial and local governments or authorities, it can only do so if the cause of action arises or the respondent government or authority is located or if the impugned act or order affects a person within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court i.e., within the Province. As a corollary, the relief granted or the writ issued by the High Court also remains within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court and can only benefit or affect a person within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court. The relief cannot go beyond the Provincial boundary and affect any other Province or Area or its people. So for example, if a federal law or federal notification is struck down by Lahore High Court, it is struck down for the Province of Punjab or in other words the federal law or the federal notification is no more applicable to the Province of Punjab but otherwise remains valid for all the other Provinces or Areas. Unless of course the Federation or the federal authority complying with the judgment of the Lahore High Court, make necessary amends or withdraw the law or the notification. Which of course would then be open to challenge by the other Provinces or Areas or their people, if they so decide. The other eventuality is that the Federation or the federal authority may or may not enforce the said law or notification in other Provinces, as a matter of administrative decision and instead challenge the judgment of the Lahore High Court before the apex Court of the country. These are the operational repercussions and effects of a judgment, setting aside a federal law or federal notification or decision. However, on a purely constitutional and legal plane, the federal law or federal notification remains in existence for the rest of the country but for the Province of Punjab. This is further fortified by the fact that in case the same federal law or federal notification is challenged in any other Province or Area, the High Court concerned is not bound by the decision of the Lahore High Court and can declare the same federal law or federal notification to be valid law (Reference Article 201 of the Constitution). Therefore, under our Constitution, while our High Courts can judicially examine and strike down a federal law or federal notification, in fact, the said federal law or notification is made non-applicable to the extent of the Province unless the matter is finally decided by the Supreme Court of Pakistan or else if the Federation or the federal authority decide to withdraw or amend the law on their own, in compliance of the judgment.
12.
 What does ""Within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court"" mean? Relying on our constitutional jurisprudence developed over the years and the provincial constitutional architecture of a High Court, writ cannot be issued by High Court against any person which is located geographically outside the territorial limits of the Province, having no physical or legal presence within the Province. See: Sandalbar Enterprises (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Central Board of Revenue and others (PLD 1997 SC 334), Flying Kraft Paper Mills (Pvt.) Ltd., Charsadda v. Central Board of Revenue, Islamabad and 2 others (1997 SCMR 1874), Asghar Hussain v. The Election Commission Pakistan (PLD 1968 SC 387), Messrs Al-Iblagh Limited, Lahore v. The Copyright Board, Karachi and others (1985 SCMR 758) and Messrs Sethi and Sethi Sons through Humayun Khan v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Islamabad and others (2012 PTD 1869).
13.
 It is trite law that if the order or action of the Government or Authority (federal or provincial), present within the Province, affect the rights of a person within the Province, writ can be issued against the said Government or Authority (irrespective of its federal character) and relief given to the aggrieved person located within the Province.
14.
 The impugned Press Note dated 13.04.2016 does this and more, as it provides for quota for all the Provinces. Granting the prayer of the petitioner and striking down the Press Note would grant relief to the people of Punjab but simultaneously upset quotas belonging to the people of other Provinces and Areas. This would amount to issuing a writ beyond the territorial limits of the Court. A Provincial High Court can only grant relief to people of the Province and cannot meddle into the affairs of the other Provinces or affect the rights and privileges of the people of the other Provinces or Areas. 50% quota allocated to the Province of Punjab under the impugned Press Note is not inseparable from the quotas allocated to the other Provinces, hence striking down the Press Note will deprive the quota allocated to all the other Provinces and Areas. Any such writ issued by this Court would also amount to transgressing the territorial limits of the Province. So while technically, for the sake of argument, writ can be issued and relief can be granted to the people of Punjab by abolishing their quota, it would also, at the same time, have the effect of abolishing the quota of other Provinces and Areas. This unique situation begs the question; whether issuance of a writ as prayed for in this case, is constitutionally impermissible or inappropriate?
15.
 In order to answer the above question, let's revisit the federalist structure of our Constitution. ""The commonly accepted features of a federal constitution are: (i) existence of two levels of government; a general government for the whole country and two or more regional governments for different regions within that country; (ii) distribution of competence or power - legislature, executive, judicial, and financial between the general and the regional governments; (iii) supremacy of the constitution that is, the foregoing arrangements are not only incorporated in the constitution but they are also beyond the reach of either governments to the extent that neither of them can unilaterally change nor breach them; (iv) dispute resolution mechanism for determining the competence of the two governments for exercising any power or for performing any function. Federalism is in fact the basis of the division of powers...The principle of Federalism is a central organizational theme of the constitution and represents a political and legal response to underlying social and political realities... A federal system of government allows different provinces to pursue specific policies tailored to the particular concerns and interests of residents in that province. The Principle of Federalism also enables provinces to enact specific statues to pursue specific collective goals, and may promote different cultures and linguistic minorities within a specific province or areas. At the same time federalism allows citizens to construct and achieve goals on a national scale through a Federal Government acting within the limits of its jurisdiction. Consequently, federalism is key to enable citizens to participate in different collectivities and to pursue objectives at local, provincial and national levels.
16.
 Federalism or Federal Principle under our Constitution envisages independent federating units with autonomous legislature, executive and judiciary. Chapter 1 of Part V of the Constitution provides for distribution of legislative power between the Federation and the Provinces. Chapter 2 of the same Part deals with distribution of executive power between the Federation and the Provinces. Chapters 1 to 3 of Part-VII deal with Judicature and the vertical sharing of jurisdiction between the Supreme Court of Pakistan and the High Courts, as well as, the horizontal jurisdictional limits between the High Courts. The Constitution provides a separate High Court for each Province and a Supreme Court of Pakistan with an overarching jurisdiction with an overlapping power with the High Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution. The provincial jurisdictional limits, delineating judicial power between co-ordinate High Courts on the basis of territory and the vertical overlap of judicial power under Article 184(3) between the High Court and the Supreme Court of Pakistan is judicial federalism. Every Provincial High Court and the High Court of the Islamabad Capital Territory has its own jurisdictional space. Any order passed by a High Court is, therefore, effective in the Province and has merely a non-binding persuasive value in other Provinces. Province is a federating unit and has its own legislature, executive and judiciary. Similarly, within the Province, the provincial High Court also functions on the same Federal Principle and exercises judicial power within the limited provincial jurisdictional space or within the Islamabad Capital Territory.
17.
 This Court while it enjoys the power to sit in judgment over the quota allocated to Punjab, the power under Article 199 of the Constitution is ""subject to the Constitution"" and will remain subject to the federal principle discussed above. In the present case the quota in question is inter-linked and combined with the quotas of the other Provinces and any interference by this Court will affect national allocation of quota in other Provinces and Areas. As relief cannot be granted to a person in Punjab without depriving the allocation of quota of the people of other Provinces, such a relief or writ issued by this Court will amount to travelling beyond the territorial limits of the Province and offend the federal principle and the core value of the Constitution.
18.
 It is also important to bear in mind, that theoretically, any other Provincial High Court can easily protect its own provincial quota by protecting the impugned Press Note or declaring it to be intra vires the Constitution. As other High Courts are not bound by the decision of the Lahore High Court, the possibility of multiple decisions or interpretations of the same federal law or federal notification cannot be ruled out, leaving behind the FPSC in total chaos, which could only be settled by the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Therefore, in a matter, where enforcement of a decision of a High Court is not possible, is it proper to exercise jurisdiction?
19.
 Another dimension of the case is the principle of forum non conveniens which is a discretionary power that allows courts to dismiss a case where another court, or forum, is much better suited to hear the case. This dismissal does not prevent a plaintiff from refiling his or her case in the more appropriate forum: The doctrine allows a court with jurisdiction over a case to dismiss it because the convenience of the parties and the interest of justice would be better served if the case were brought in a court having proper jurisdiction in another venue. ""The doctrine of forum non conveniens, i.e., that some other forum is more ""appropriate"" in the sense of more suitable for the ends of justice, was developed by the Scottish courts in the nineteenth century, and was adopted (with some modifications) in the United States. The Scots rule is that the court may decline to exercise jurisdiction, after giving consideration to the interests of the parties and the requirements of justice, on the ground that the case cannot be suitably tried in the Scottish court nor full justice be done there, but only in another court. The basic principle is that.... the court is satisfied that there is some other available forum, having competent jurisdiction, which is the appropriate forum for the trial of the action, i.e. in which the case may be tried more suitably for the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice. Applying this principle to the facts of the present case, the matter in hand, can best be resolved at the Supreme Court of Pakistan.
20.
 Considering the principles discussed above, if impugned Press Note dated 13.04.2016, for the sake of argument, is struck down by this Court it will not only abolish the Punjab quota but also the quota of other Provinces for the purposes of CSS Examination. I am, therefore, of the considered view that interference by this Court would be constitutionally inappropriate and impermissible. Therefore, for the multiple reasons narrated above, I decline to exercise jurisdiction in this matter and leave the parties to approach the august Supreme Court of Pakistan for the redressal of their grievance, if so advised.
21.
 This petition is, therefore, dismissed.

 The above Press Note allocates quota to four Provinces, Gilgit Baltistan, FATA and AJK for the purposes of CSS Examination-2015. It is important to underline that the Press Note lays down a national quota allocation scheme. This allocation cannot be read in isolation for Punjab. 50% quota allocated to Punjab is not separable and cannot be sliced away without affecting the ratios allocated to other Provinces and Areas. The countrywide quota system envisaged in the Press Note is inter- linked and together constitutes a total of 100%. This is a unique case, where any intervention by this Court would upset the equilibrium of national quota system structured for CSS-Examination 2015 and affect the rights and privileges of the people of other Provinces, having smaller quotas.

 What is the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 199? Article 175 states that there shall be a High Court for each Province and no court shall have any jurisdiction save as is or may be conferred on it by the Constitution or by or under any law. The jurisdiction conferred on the High Court under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 is as under:-
199. Jurisdiction of High Court
.---(1) Subject to the Constitution, a High Court may, if it is satisfied that no other adequate remedy is provided by law,--
(a)
 on the application of any aggrieved party, make an order---
(i)
 directing a person performing, within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court, functions in connection with the affairs of the Federation, a Province or a local authority, to refrain from doing anything he is not permitted by law to do, or to do anything he is required by law to do; or
(ii)
 declaring that any act done or proceeding taken within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court by a person performing functions in connection with the affairs of the Federation, a Province or a local authority has been done or taken without lawful authority and is of no legal effect; or
(b)
 on the application of any person, make an order 
(i)
 directing that a person in custody within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court be brought before it so that the Court may satisfy itself that he is not being held in custody without lawful authority or in an unlawful manner; or
(ii)
 requiring a person within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court holding or purporting to hold a public office to show under what authority of law he claims to hold that office; or
(c)
 on the application of any aggrieved person, make an order giving such directions to any person or authority, including any Government exercising any power or performing any function in, or in relation to, any territory within the jurisdiction of that Court as may be appropriate for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights conferred by Chapter 1 of Part II. (emphasis supplied)
Article 201 provides that any decision of a High Court to the extent it decides a question of law or is based upon or enunciates a principle of law shall be binding on all courts subordinate to it. Similarly, Article 202 provides that the High Court may make rules regulating the practice and procedure of any court subordinate to it. While Article 203 provides that High Court shall supervise and control all courts subordinate to it.
11.
 Constitutional terms like ""High Court for each Province"" ""within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court"" and ""all courts subordinate to it"" construct a High Court, which has a provincial character. The term ""within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court"" ubiquitously recurs throughout Article 199 emphasizing the territorial limitation on the jurisdiction of a High Court. The term ""All courts subordinate to it"" repeated in Articles 201, 202 and 203 place the Provincial High Court atop a provincial pyramidical hierarchy of courts. Constitutional architecture of a Provincial High Court provides that while it enjoys judicial power to examine all laws or actions of the federal, provincial and local governments or authorities, it can only do so if the cause of action arises or the respondent government or authority is located or if the impugned act or order affects a person within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court i.e., within the Province. As a corollary, the relief granted or the writ issued by the High Court also remains within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court and can only benefit or affect a person within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court. The relief cannot go beyond the Provincial boundary and affect any other Province or Area or its people. So for example, if a federal law or federal notification is struck down by Lahore High Court, it is struck down for the Province of Punjab or in other words the federal law or the federal notification is no more applicable to the Province of Punjab but otherwise remains valid for all the other Provinces or Areas. Unless of course the Federation or the federal authority complying with the judgment of the Lahore High Court, make necessary amends or withdraw the law or the notification. Which of course would then be open to challenge by the other Provinces or Areas or their people, if they so decide. The other eventuality is that the Federation or the federal authority may or may not enforce the said law or notification in other Provinces, as a matter of administrative decision and instead challenge the judgment of the Lahore High Court before the apex Court of the country. These are the operational repercussions and effects of a judgment, setting aside a federal law or federal notification or decision. However, on a purely constitutional and legal plane, the federal law or federal notification remains in existence for the rest of the country but for the Province of Punjab. This is further fortified by the fact that in case the same federal law or federal notification is challenged in any other Province or Area, the High Court concerned is not bound by the decision of the Lahore High Court and can declare the same federal law or federal notification to be valid law (Reference Article 201 of the Constitution). Therefore, under our Constitution, while our High Courts can judicially examine and strike down a federal law or federal notification, in fact, the said federal law or notification is made non-applicable to the extent of the Province unless the matter is finally decided by the Supreme Court of Pakistan or else if the Federation or the federal authority decide to withdraw or amend the law on their own, in compliance of the judgment.
12.
 What does ""Within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court"" mean? Relying on our constitutional jurisprudence developed over the years and the provincial constitutional architecture of a High Court, writ cannot be issued by High Court against any person which is located geographically outside the territorial limits of the Province, having no physical or legal presence within the Province. See: Sandalbar Enterprises (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Central Board of Revenue and others (PLD 1997 SC 334), Flying Kraft Paper Mills (Pvt.) Ltd., Charsadda v. Central Board of Revenue, Islamabad and 2 others (1997 SCMR 1874), Asghar Hussain v. The Election Commission Pakistan (PLD 1968 SC 387), Messrs Al-Iblagh Limited, Lahore v. The Copyright Board, Karachi and others (1985 SCMR 758) and Messrs Sethi and Sethi Sons through Humayun Khan v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Islamabad and others (2012 PTD 1869).
13.
 It is trite law that if the order or action of the Government or Authority (federal or provincial), present within the Province, affect the rights of a person within the Province, writ can be issued against the said Government or Authority (irrespective of its federal character) and relief given to the aggrieved person located within the Province.
14.
 The impugned Press Note dated 13.04.2016 does this and more, as it provides for quota for all the Provinces. Granting the prayer of the petitioner and striking down the Press Note would grant relief to the people of Punjab but simultaneously upset quotas belonging to the people of other Provinces and Areas. This would amount to issuing a writ beyond the territorial limits of the Court. A Provincial High Court can only grant relief to people of the Province and cannot meddle into the affairs of the other Provinces or affect the rights and privileges of the people of the other Provinces or Areas. 50% quota allocated to the Province of Punjab under the impugned Press Note is not inseparable from the quotas allocated to the other Provinces, hence striking down the Press Note will deprive the quota allocated to all the other Provinces and Areas. Any such writ issued by this Court would also amount to transgressing the territorial limits of the Province. So while technically, for the sake of argument, writ can be issued and relief can be granted to the people of Punjab by abolishing their quota, it would also, at the same time, have the effect of abolishing the quota of other Provinces and Areas. This unique situation begs the question; whether issuance of a writ as prayed for in this case, is constitutionally impermissible or inappropriate?
15.
 In order to answer the above question, let's revisit the federalist structure of our Constitution. ""The commonly accepted features of a federal constitution are: (i) existence of two levels of government; a general government for the whole country and two or more regional governments for different regions within that country; (ii) distribution of competence or power - legislature, executive, judicial, and financial between the general and the regional governments; (iii) supremacy of the constitution that is, the foregoing arrangements are not only incorporated in the constitution but they are also beyond the reach of either governments to the extent that neither of them can unilaterally change nor breach them; (iv) dispute resolution mechanism for determining the competence of the two governments for exercising any power or for performing any function. Federalism is in fact the basis of the division of powers...The principle of Federalism is a central organizational theme of the constitution and represents a political and legal response to underlying social and political realities... A federal system of government allows different provinces to pursue specific policies tailored to the particular concerns and interests of residents in that province. The Principle of Federalism also enables provinces to enact specific statues to pursue specific collective goals, and may promote different cultures and linguistic minorities within a specific province or areas. At the same time federalism allows citizens to construct and achieve goals on a national scale through a Federal Government acting within the limits of its jurisdiction. Consequently, federalism is key to enable citizens to participate in different collectivities and to pursue objectives at local, provincial and national levels.
16.
 Federalism or Federal Principle under our Constitution envisages independent federating units with autonomous legislature, executive and judiciary. Chapter 1 of Part V of the Constitution provides for distribution of legislative power between the Federation and the Provinces. Chapter 2 of the same Part deals with distribution of executive power between the Federation and the Provinces. Chapters 1 to 3 of Part-VII deal with Judicature and the vertical sharing of jurisdiction between the Supreme Court of Pakistan and the High Courts, as well as, the horizontal jurisdictional limits between the High Courts. The Constitution provides a separate High Court for each Province and a Supreme Court of Pakistan with an overarching jurisdiction with an overlapping power with the High Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution. The provincial jurisdictional limits, delineating judicial power between co-ordinate High Courts on the basis of territory and the vertical overlap of judicial power under Article 184(3) between the High Court and the Supreme Court of Pakistan is judicial federalism. Every Provincial High Court and the High Court of the Islamabad Capital Territory has its own jurisdictional space. Any order passed by a High Court is, therefore, effective in the Province and has merely a non-binding persuasive value in other Provinces. Province is a federating unit and has its own legislature, executive and judiciary. Similarly, within the Province, the provincial High Court also functions on the same Federal Principle and exercises judicial power within the limited provincial jurisdictional space or within the Islamabad Capital Territory.
17.
 This Court while it enjoys the power to sit in judgment over the quota allocated to Punjab, the power under Article 199 of the Constitution is ""subject to the Constitution"" and will remain subject to the federal principle discussed above. In the present case the quota in question is inter-linked and combined with the quotas of the other Provinces and any interference by this Court will affect national allocation of quota in other Provinces and Areas. As relief cannot be granted to a person in Punjab without depriving the allocation of quota of the people of other Provinces, such a relief or writ issued by this Court will amount to travelling beyond the territorial limits of the Province and offend the federal principle and the core value of the Constitution.
18.
 It is also important to bear in mind, that theoretically, any other Provincial High Court can easily protect its own provincial quota by protecting the impugned Press Note or declaring it to be intra vires the Constitution. As other High Courts are not bound by the decision of the Lahore High Court, the possibility of multiple decisions or interpretations of the same federal law or federal notification cannot be ruled out, leaving behind the FPSC in total chaos, which could only be settled by the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Therefore, in a matter, where enforcement of a decision of a High Court is not possible, is it proper to exercise jurisdiction?
19.
 Another dimension of the case is the principle of forum non conveniens which is a discretionary power that allows courts to dismiss a case where another court, or forum, is much better suited to hear the case. This dismissal does not prevent a plaintiff from refiling his or her case in the more appropriate forum: The doctrine allows a court with jurisdiction over a case to dismiss it because the convenience of the parties and the interest of justice would be better served if the case were brought in a court having proper jurisdiction in another venue. ""The doctrine of forum non conveniens, i.e., that some other forum is more ""appropriate"" in the sense of more suitable for the ends of justice, was developed by the Scottish courts in the nineteenth century, and was adopted (with some modifications) in the United States. The Scots rule is that the court may decline to exercise jurisdiction, after giving consideration to the interests of the parties and the requirements of justice, on the ground that the case cannot be suitably tried in the Scottish court nor full justice be done there, but only in another court. The basic principle is that.... the court is satisfied that there is some other available forum, having competent jurisdiction, which is the appropriate forum for the trial of the action, i.e. in which the case may be tried more suitably for the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice. Applying this principle to the facts of the present case, the matter in hand, can best be resolved at the Supreme Court of Pakistan.
20.
 Considering the principles discussed above, if impugned Press Note dated 13.04.2016, for the sake of argument, is struck down by this Court it will not only abolish the Punjab quota but also the quota of other Provinces for the purposes of CSS Examination. I am, therefore, of the considered view that interference by this Court would be constitutionally inappropriate and impermissible. Therefore, for the multiple reasons narrated above, I decline to exercise jurisdiction in this matter and leave the parties to approach the august Supreme Court of Pakistan for the redressal of their grievance, if so advised.
21.
 This petition is, therefore, dismissed.

 Petition dismissed."
