0,"SAHIBZADA SANAULLAH, MEMBER, PROVINCIAL ASSEMBLY Versus GOVERNMENT OF KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA","June 13, 2017",PESHAWAR HIGH COURT, Honorable Justice Waqar Ahmad Seth ,2017 PLD 186,"JUDGMENT
 WAQAR AHMAD SETH, J.---
Sahibzada Sanaullah, Member Provincial Assembly, PK-93 Upper Dir, hereinafter called the petitioner, has invoked the writ jurisdiction of this Court under Article-199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 with the prayer to declare the discrimination in allocation of funds in the constituency of petitioner i.e. PK-93 in comparison to others as illegal, unconstitutional, void ab initio and direct the respondents to treat it at par / equal with others constituencies qua distribution of funds in all ADPs, in the interest of justice.
2.
 Facts, in brief relevant for the disposal of this writ petition are that, petitioner who is a returned candidate hailing from PK-93 Dir Upper, alleges that in General Election of 2013, one Behram Khan was declared as returned candidates and he remained as Member Provincial Assembly for sufficient time and being in alliance with the Government almost in all ADPs/developmental schemes/projects equal allocation of funds were granted/released to him/PK-93, which is evident from revised umbrella PC-1 ADP No. 732/150205 (2016-2017), however, after the decision of Election Tribunal as well as apex Court, when petitioner was declared as returned candidate, the existing projects/schemes standstill due to shortage of funds, besides other developmental schemes in all most all ADPs/other departments i.e. Irrigation and Communication of Works and Services Departments, funds have been distributed on discriminatory basis, depriving the locality/people of PK-93 from their due right as enshrined in Constitution by not treating them at par with other constituencies, hence the instant writ petition.
3.
 Comments were called from respondents which they furnished by negating the stance of petitioner and stated that umbrella PC-I for the scheme under ADP No.732 (2016-2017) ""Uplift of Rural Roads in Dir Upper and Dir Lower"" was originally approved at cost of Rs.500.00 million by PDWP forum. The cost of said ADP scheme has been enhanced through Chief Minister's Directive and consequently original cost increased to Rs.1050.00 million and revised PC-I was submitted by field office on need basis and get approval from PDWP forum. The subject scheme only covering two district i.e. Dir Upper and Dir Lower and the funds are allocated to the areas on need basis of the same districts and not constituency wise whereas no funds have been allocated out of the districts. There is no mechanism to allocate funds to members of Provincial Assembly, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The funds are allocated for the District on the recommendation of MPA, the constituency of the petitioner falls in Dir Upper and his District has been given 630 million against 1050 million.. That petitioner has not yet identified schemes under allocation of Rs.20.00 million. Furthermore, an amount of Rs.235.642 million has been allocated for developmental schemes of PK-93 in the last 40 years under ADP Nos. 730, 1316, 732 and RAHA programs, requested for dismissal of the writ petition.
4.
 We have heard learned counsel for the parties and available record gone through.
5.
 The facts which are not denying are that petitioner is the Member of Provincial Assembly from PK-93 Upper Dir, elected in the General Election 2013 and before the General Election 2013 the constituency of PK-93 was treated equally and in almost all the ADPs proper/equal allocation of funds were made to all the projects in the area and after that the funds allocated to the said constituency are much much less. Even in the district Dir, upper and lower which includes PK-91 to PK-97 the allocation of funds for PK-93 are 1/4th of the other allocation in other constituencies. For example at page-20 of the writ petition a breakup for the schemes ""uplift of rural roads in district Dir upper and lower, is a letter dated 20.12.2016, showing that PK-91 has been allocated 120 million, PK-92, 94, 95 and 96 are allocated 90 million each and PK-97 has been allocated 50 million while PK-93, are just with 20 million. Likewise in the first phase same was the position and in this respect documents attached at page-21 of the writ petition reflects the exact position. The obvious reasons mentioned by the petitioner that he belongs to opposition bench seems to be a correct allegation. Learned AAG along with representative of respondents failed to convince the Court that why is the such difference, even in the same district.
6.
 We have before us, the documents showing that petitioner time and again agitated the matter and finally vide letter dated 23.12.2016, Secretary Local Government was advised by the Worthy Chief Minister KPK to include in ADP scheme 732 to the constituency of PK-93, Upper Dir, but in spite of that nothing has been done as yet. The comparative statement placed on record clearly reflects that in the past, allocation of funds have been done discriminately, to the constituency of the petitioner in comparison to the members of ruling coalition partners. The allocation of funds to the Members of Provincial Assembly and their respective constituencies with different yardstick is not only discrimination of a particular member, but the public at large of a particular constituency have been deprived of their fundamental rights in all other departments as well.
7.
 This Court while deciding Writ Petition No. 4264-P of 2015, on 11.5.2016, while dealing with the royalty in reference to District Development Advisory Committee Act, 1989 and allocation of funds through the elected representatives has held as under:-
""There is no denial to the fact that royalty from the income of Oil and Gas discovered in the southern area is given to the concerned MPA for carrying of developmental project, in the district of Karak, Hangu and Kohat from the very inception. We have before us letter dated 25th August, 2015 issued from the Chief Minister Secretariat, addressed to Deputy Commissioner, Hangu, with the subject ""Identification of developmental schemes out of Oil and Gas Royalty, 2014-15"". The directions given by the Competent Authority are that funds amounting to rupees 108.00 million be released for developmental schemes proposed/identified by the concerned MNA. Likewise there is a letter dated 26th September, 2014 from the office of Chief Minister Secretariat addressed to Deputy Commissioner with the direction of the competent authority that request / demand of the president PTI for developmental schemes may be entertained out of Oil and Gas Royalty funds. Whereas the petitioner who is elected Member Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, PK-43, Hangu-2 has been deprived of his legitimate right to identify his schemes.
Record is suggestive that when these funds were not released/ allocated for the identification of schemes of the petitioner's, petitioner agitated the matter at the floor of the house and the matter was referred to the standing committee No.10, wherein the stance taken by the petitioner was acceded to, subsequently the said report of the standing committee No.10 on question No. 2375 of the petitioner was also presented in the Provincial Assembly. Record is further suggestive that the respondents gave the assurance but no practical steps were taken in this respect, therefore, a privilege motion was moved on 27.2.2015, which was referred to privilege committee and privilege No.59 was taken and it was unanimously agreed upon in the meeting of the committee and according to the directive of Chief Minister half of the fund of rupees 10 caroor and 80 lakhs was assured to be released forthwith and as such the privilege motion was delayed till the release of entire fund. Record suggests that there are number of correspondence in between petitioner, Speaker Provincial Assembly and Chief Minister, except release of rupees 108.560 million out of 10% during the financial year 2014-15 were released to Tehsil Tall PK-43.
Record is suggestive that more than 30 million rupees were approved and released by the Chief Minister to the president, Pakistan Tehreek Insaf, District Hangu, vide letter dated 17.11.2014 and rupees 108 million for the schemes identified by the MNA who also belongs to the ruling party. According to the law of land, the development funds are to be utilized through the elected representative of the constituency for provincial purposes and the MNA do not figure anywhere, what to say of office bearer/president of a ruling political party. If any funds as submitted by the petitioner, are released to the president Tehreek Insaf District Hangu, in the given circumstances amounts to a cognizable offence for the purpose of NAB Ordinance 1999 as well as Ehtesab Act, 2014.
Although petitioner has not called in question the guidelines for the release and utilization of funds from 10% Oil and Gas royalty and the formation/composition of District Development Committee at District level, however, it is observed that the same is not legally and properly constituted committee, because the public funds can only be utilized after observing legal formalities required and made mandatory under the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Establishment of District Development Advisory Committee Act, 1989, the relevant sections / clauses are as under:--
 
Clause (e) of section 2 defines the committee as:
""Committee means the District Development Advisory Committee of the District concerned, established under section 3.
 
Section 3 of the Act provides as;
3.(1) There shall be established, with immediate effect a committee to be known as the District Development Advisory Committee in each District, consisting of
(a)
 All the Members of the Provincial Assembly from the District concerned;
(b)
 Such other elected representative as the government may specify to be taken on the committee as co-opted members; and
(c)
 Such heads of Attached department at the district level as may be co-opted by the committee for their expert opinion.
(2)
 A co-opted member shall have no right of vote to exercise in any deliberation of the committee.
(3)
 The Chief Minister shall appoint one of the members to be the Chairman of the committee, who shall hold office during the pleasure of the Chief Minister.
(4)
 The committee shall take all decisions by consensus of opinion, but where such consensus is not achieved, the matter shall subject to the provision of subsection (2) be decided by majority of votes;
Provided that in case of equality of votes, the chairman shall have a second or casting vote;
Provided further that where a quota has been allocated to a Member in the development schemes of the province or the schemes approved are to be divided quota-wise, then there shall be no need for obtaining consensus of opinion regarding the allocation of projects or selection of sites, as the case may be, and it shall be the sole discretion of the member concerned to select sites or allocate projects, as the case may be, within his own quota.
(5)
 No act or proceedings of the committee shall be invalid by reason only of the existence of a vacancy in, or defect in the establishment of the Committee.
In view of above proceedings of the Provincial Assembly and assurance made and the discriminations so brought on record for the release of funds to another MPA from PK-42 of the same District, petitioner has made out a case of discrimination and victimization due to political differences and as such, this writ petition is allowed, as prayed for.
8.
 All the elected representatives have the equal right to the allocation of funds; especially the developmental funds and any deviation would be amounting to discrimination and against the fundamental and legal rights of the elected representatives and even the inhabitants of the constituency. In the comments so filed by respondent No.3 they have stated that there is no mechanism to allocate funds to Provincial Members, whereas in the comments of LG&RDD Department, it has been stated that umbrella PC-I of the scheme under ADP ""uplift of rural roads and Dir Upper and Dir Lower"" was originally approved at cost of Rs.500 million by PDWF forum and the said cost has been enhanced through Chief Minister directives by submitting revised PC-I, submitted by field offices on need basis and got approved from PDWF forum.
9.
 Admittedly, the subject scheme is umbrella in nature covering only two districts i.e District Upper and Lower and as such funds are allocated to the particular area on need basis of the same district. It has also been stated in the comments para-3 as under; moreover, the concerned MPA PK-93 has not yet identified schemes under allocation of Rs.20.00 million. Furthermore, an amount of Rs.235.642 million has been allocated for developmental schemes of PK-93 in the last 4 years."" Confirming that identification of the concerned MPA is the requirement and as such the plea of the petitioner that he was not asked for any identification rather the ongoing schemes are on the identification of ruling party office bearers and future contesting candidates seems to be correct. Even otherwise, the chart given in para-3 of the parawise comments, at page-2, clearly shows that in the constituencies PK-93 of petitioner and PK-97, which is also an opposition MPA, have been allocated less than hundred million while the constituencies i.e PK-91, 92, 94, 95, 96 are all having more than 150 million, clearly demonstrating the favoritism and nepotism. It is the bounden duty of the Government/public functionaries to function in good faith, honestly and within the parameter of its power so that person concerned should be treated in accordance with law as guaranteed by Article 4, of the constitution, which includes principles of natural justice, procedure fairness and procedure proprietary and any action, which was mala fide or colorable could not be regarded as action in accordance with law. In the case of Pir Imran Sajid and others v. Managing Director/General Manager (Manager Finance) Telephone Industries of Pakistan reported in 2015 SCMR 1257 (d), (e) & (f) it has been held as under:--
----Art. 4 & Preamble---Socio-economic justice---Scope---Whole edifice of governance of the society had its genesis in the constitution and laws aimed at to establish an order, inter alia, ensuring the provisions of socio-economic justice, so that the people may have guarantee and sense of being treated in accordance with law, and that they were not being deprived of their due rights.
----Art. 4 and Public functionaries, duty of---Natural justice---Procedural fairness and propriety---Every public functionary was supposed to function in good faith, honestly and within the precincts of its power so that person concerned should be treated in accordance with law as guaranteed by Art. 4 of the Constitution, which included principles of natural justice, procedural fairness and procedural propriety--Any action which was mala fide or colourable was not regarded as action in accordance with law.
----Arts.4 & 25-Administration authorities, duty of--Good governance---Scope of good governance could not be achieved by exercising discretionary powers unreasonably or arbitrarily and without application of mind---Such objective could be achieved by following the rules of justness, fairness and openness in consonance with the command of the Constitution enshrined in different articles including Arts. 4 & 25 of the Constitution---Obligation to act fairly on the part of the administrative authority had been evolved to ensure the rule of law and to prevent failure of the justice.
10.
 In view of the above this writ petition is allowed, as prayed for.

 LAL JAN KHATTAK, J.---
Petitioner Rehmanullah seeks his post arrest bail in case FIR No.44 dated 26.01.2017 under sections 18(b) and 22(b) of the Emigration Ordinance, 1979 of Police Station FIA, AHTC, Peshawar, wherein, he is charged for taking money from the complainant in order to send him abroad.
2.
 Arguments heard and record gone through.
3.
 A cursory look at the case record would show that in the FIR no specific date has been mentioned on which the complainant had given money to the petitioner for sending him abroad, which aspect of the case cannot be overlooked while deciding this bail petition. Furthermore, both the offences for which the petitioner stands charged are punishable with imprisonment for 14 years or with fine or with both. It is well settled that when a Statute provides two punishments simultaneously for commission of an offence, then for the purpose of bail the lesser punishment is considered by the court and there is reason for that as in case the prosecution succeeds in proving its case against the accused, then whether the court will inflict him the maximum or the minimum sentence, which aspect of the case has brought the petitioner's case within the ambit of further inquiry as there is no certainty that he will be awarded the term of imprisonment. Moreso, investigation in the case is complete and the petitioner is no more required for further investigation. Apart from the above learned counsel for the petitioner relied on case law reported as 2006 MLD 1062, 2012 YLR 1106/2511, 2014 PCr.LJ 297, 2016 YLR 355 and 2016 PCr.LJ 1238, wherein, the accused similarly charged were granted bail.
4.
 Tentative assessment of the case record would reveal that involvement of the petitioner qua his guilt in the crime needs further inquiry in terms of subsection (2) of section 497, Cr.P.C., therefore, he is entitled to the concession of bail.
5.
 For what has been discussed above, this petition is allowed and the petitioner is granted bail subject to his furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs.100,000/- with two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of learned trial court, which shall ensure that the sureties are local, reliable and men of means.

 ZAHEER-UD-DIN KAKAR, J.---
 The petitioners through this petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973 assails the validity of order dated 24.4.2017 ""the impugned order"", passed by the Special Judge, Anti-Terrorism Court-II, Quetta ""the trial Court"", whereby an application for transfer of the case was dismissed.
2.
 Precisely stated, the facts of the case are that on 17.9.2016 at about 5:15 p.m, the complainant Captain Adnan Ishaq of 74 Wing, Chiltan Rifles, lodged FIR No.264 of 2016, under Sections 337-AD, 353, 392, 511, 186, 147, 148, 149, P.P.C. read with section 7 ATA with Satellite Town Police Station, Quetta against the petitioners with the allegations that on the fateful day, he (complainant) along with other FC personnel were checking the vehicles. Meanwhile, one Land Cruiser bearing registration No.LEF-20 having black glasses, wherein three armed gunmen were present, came from western side, which was stopped and on query a permit was showed which was not acceptable. Then a person, whose name was later on known as Haji Sadiq, said that no one could stop him, thus, a quarrel took place which resulted in causing injury to sepoy Mureed Abbas and they also attempted to snatch the official weapon from sepoy Akmal. The FC personnel overpowered the petitioners and recovered different types of weapon and rounds, detail mentioned in FIR.
3.
 After completion of investigation. challan of the case was submitted before the trial Court. During pendency of the case, an application under section 23 of the ATA, 1997 was moved on behalf of the accused (petitioners). The trial Court, through order dated 26.4.2017 rejected the application, hence this petition.
4.
 Learned counsel for the petitioners contended that the impugned order passed by the trial Court is against the law; that the trial Court has mis-appreciated the facts of the case; that the provisions of section 6 of ATA, 1997 not attracted in this case; that the offences mentioned in the FIR have no nexus with the definition of section 6 of the Act. Finally, he prayed for setting aside the impugned order and transfer of the case to the ordinary Court.
5.
 We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and has gone through the available record. In order to determine as to whether an offence would fall within the ambit of section 6 of Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, it is essential to have a glance over the allegations made in the FIR, material collected during investigation and surrounding circumstances. It is also necessary to examine whether the ingredients of alleged offence have any nexus with the object of the case as contemplated under sections 6, 7 and 8 thereof. Whether a particular act is an act of terrorism or not, the motivation, object design and purpose behind the said act is to be seen. It is also to be seen as to whether the said act has created a sense of fear and insecurity in the public or in a section of the public or community or in any sect and, whether the action results in striking terror or creating fear, panic, sensation, helplessness and sense of insecurity among the people in the particular area it amounts to terror and such an action squarely falls within the ambit of section 6 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 and shall be triable by a Special Court constituted for such purpose.
6.
 Section 6 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 provides the definition of ""terrorism"". In order to better appreciate the legal position. Section 6(b) of the said Act which defines a ""terrorist act"" is reproduced as under:
""6.
 Terrorism
.---(1) In this Act, ""terrorism"" means the use or threat of action where
(a)
(b)
 The use or threat is designed to coerce and intimidate or overawe the Government or the public or a section of the public or community or sect or create a sense of fear or insecurity in society.""
7.
 A bare reading of the above quoted provision of law makes it crystal clear that Courts have only to see whether the ""terrorist act"" was such which would have the tendency to create sense of fear and insecurity in the minds of the people or any section of the society. The honourable Supreme Court in a case reported as The State through Advocate General, N.W.F.P. Peshawar v. Muhammad Shafiq PLD 2003 SC 224 has held as under:--
""We have to see the psychological impact created upon the minds of the people. It is also not necessary that the said act must have taken place within the view of general public so as to bring it within the encompass of the Act. Even an act having taken place in a barbaric and gruesome manner, if it had created fear and insecurity, would certainly come within the purview of the act.""
8.
 In the present case, the petitioners have committed offence on the main road, target was Frontier Corps officers and officials and during scuffle with the FC officials, sepoy Mureed Abbas sustained injuries and they (petitioners) also tried to snatch official weapons from FC personnel. They were overpowered and the FC personnel recovered different types of weapons and rounds from their possession. The act of the petitioners on main road created fear and insecurity to the general public. Moreover, act of the petitioners apparently involves serious violence against the members of the law enforcement agency (F.C.) as such, case prima facie falls under section 6(m) and (n) of Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, therefore, Anti-Terrorism Court has the exclusive jurisdiction to try the case, as such, we do not find merit in this petition and the same is dismissed in limine.

3,NOOR MUHAMMAD Versus SAJJAD AKHTAR,"June 12, 2017",QUETTA HIGH COURT BALOCHISTAN, Honorable Justice Abdullah Baloch ,2017 PLD 96,"JUDGMENT
 ABDULLAH BALOCH, J.---
This judgment disposes of C.P. No.96 of 2016 filed by petitioner Noor Muhammad S/o Gul Muhammad caste Baloch, resident of Turbat, against the respondents with the averments that the petitioner is allotee of plots Nos.330 and 351 in Satellite Town Turbat and the said property was allotted to him on 9th May 1996 and the petitioner has regularly deposited the installments of the said plots besides by making huge expenses on construction of a boundary wall over the plots and also having the peaceful possession of the aforesaid plots.
2.
 It is further averred from the petition of the petitioner that the respondent No.1 Sajjad Akhtar S/o Muhammad Usman filed an application (complaint) before the respondent No.4 Provincial Ombudsman (Mohtasib Balochistan) in the year 2011 wherein stated that the plot Nos. B-330 and B-351 of Satellite Town Turbat were allotted to Haji Noor Muhammad and Ghulam Sarwar respectively by the then Chairman Municipal Committee Turbat and it was alleged in the said application that the petitioner being an irrelevant person occupied these plots illegally and unlawfully, had constructed a four wall without issuing NOC in his favour for construction. It is further submitted by the petitioner that on such application of respondent No.1 the learned Ombudsman Balochsitan (respondent No.4) without issuing notice to the petitioner and without investigating the matter directed the official respondent No.2 vide its findings/decision dated 9th Apri1 2013, relevant portion whereof reproduced as under:-
Keeping in view the above there is no need of further investigation. The higher authorities of Local Government Department needs to take action against officers not fulfilling their duties properly and plots in satellite town Turbat are being occupied/encroached by irrelevant persons, be vacated and entrusted to their lawful owners. The case is closed and parties are informed accordingly.
3.
 The learned counsel for the petitioner contended that on the directions of learned Ombudsman Balochistan, the official respondents have started illegal interference in the peaceful possession of the petitioner. He further contended that even otherwise, the matter pertains to factual controversy and is a civil dispute in nature, which could not be resolved or entertained by the Ombudsman, as such, the order passed by the learned Ombudsman is without jurisdiction, void ab initio, not sustainable and liable to be set aside.
4.
 The petition was contested by the respondents Nos.1,2 and 3 wherein categorically denied the claim of the petition, Mr. Jadain Dashti, learned counsel for the respondent No.1 while arguing the case stated that basically the plots in question were allotted to Haji Noor Muhammad S/o Gul Muhammad and Ghulam Sarwar S/o Muhammad Usman by the then Chairman, Municipal Committee Turbat, which was later on occupied by the petitioner as a result whereof the respondent No.1 filed a complaint on behalf of Haji Noor Muhammad and Ghulam Sarwar allottees before the learned Ombudsman Balochistan and after proper investigation and calling of record from the concerned quarters, the learned Ombudsman passed directions to the concerned authorities to get vacate the plots from the petitioner/occupant. He further contended that against the order of Ombudsman appeal is provided, as such, Constitution Petition is not maintainable.
5.
 Mr. Saleem Baloch, learned Additional Advocate General while arguing the matter on behalf of respondents Nos.2 and 3 submitted that the respondent No.2 i,e. Municipal Committee Turbat in his Para-wise comments declared the allotments of the petitioner as fake one, while verified the allotment orders of the Haji Noor Muhammad and Ghulam Sarwar as genuine, who were represented by the respondent No.1. He further contended that against the order of Ombudsman, Constitution Petition is incompetent and the petition so filed by the petitioner is liable to be dismissed.
6.
 We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record, the moot question arised between the parties is that whether the learned Ombudsman having jurisdiction to decide the civil dispute. The learned counsel for the petitioner mainly agitated the point of jurisdiction that the Ombudsman having no jurisdiction to decide civil disputes pertaining to factual controversies while on the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent No.1 and the learned AAG raised objection on the maintainability of the petition on the ground that the order so passed by the Ombudsman within the purview of the Ordinance of 2001 could not be assailed in constitutional jurisdiction while appeal is provided under section 32 of the Ordinance of 2001 to be filed with the worthy Governor of Balochistan.
7.
 After thorough analysis of the arguments put forth before us we are of the firm opinion that so far as the contention of respondent regarding Section 29 of Ordinance of 2001 is concerned, the such provisions contained in Section 29 of Ordinance of 2001 would only apply, if the Ombudsman order is within the four corners of the law defining its jurisdiction, if there is any lack of jurisdiction, the provisions contained in Article 199 of Constitution would be attracted. It is by now settled by the Superior Courts that, where the order passed by the Ombudsman, on the face of it is repugnant to law, under which it was made or suffers from want of jurisdiction, this Court may invoke its inherent jurisdiction vested in it under the law so as to prevent injustice being done to an aggrieved person. The jurisdiction of the Ombudsman is restricted by Section 9 (1) of the Ordinance of 2001 and cannot be extended further.
8.
 It is also shocking to note that the Ombudsman while accepting the complaint of respondent No.1 without issuing notice to the petitioner. The order passed by the learned Ombudsman, without affording an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner, cannot be blessed with blanket of authenticity, being violative of universally acknowledged principle of ""Audi Alteram Partem"", which has gained much importance after insertion of Article 10-A of the Constitution. In this respect, reliance is placed to the case of ""Pakistan Cromines Limited v. The Inquiry Officer, WarRisk Insurance (Sindh Balochistan Ministry of Commerce) (1983 SCMR 1208"").
9
 It is settled principle of law that the judgment of honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan is binding on each and every organ of state by virtue of Articles 189 and 190 of the Constitution. It is also settled by now that when the basic order is without lawful authority, then the superstructure shall have to fall on the ground automatically.
10.
 Now coming to the last limb of argument advanced by the learned A A.G and counsel for the private of respondent that in presence of alternate remedy against the order passed by the Ombudsman by way of appeal under section 32 of the Ordinance of 2001, this petition is not maintainable. We are of the considered view though ordinarily, when alternate remedy is available, the constitution petition is not maintainable, but in the cases, where the order impugned is patently illegal and without jurisdiction, the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court cannot be abridged on account of availability of alternate remedy, rather this Court, being custodian of fundamental rights of the citizens of the country, is under obligation to take care of the orders passed by the executives and Quasi judicial forums, when the same are brought before it in the constitution petition. In this regard, reference can be made to the cases of ""Muslim Abad Cooperative Housing Society Limited v. M/s Siddiqa Faiz ( PLD 2008 Supreme Court 135) and M/s Ahmed Clinic v. Government of Sindh 2003 CLC 1196, it was held by the Honorable Supreme Court that the High Court will not entertain a writ petition when other appropriate remedy is available is not a rule of law barring jurisdiction, but a rule by which the Court regulates it jurisdiction. When statutory functionary with mala fide or in impartial, unjust and oppressive manner, the High Court in exercise of its writ jurisdiction has power to grant relief to the aggrieved party.
11.
 Although the Court exercising writ jurisdiction cannot claim in the exercise of constitutional power to usurp the functions of the authority on which the power had been vested, but the Court exercising writ jurisdiction can insist for being satisfied that the action taken is not mere a colorable power. Even otherwise, as already observed hereinabove, neither the petitioner arrayed as party by the respondent No.1 in his application/complaint, nor did the Ombudsman bother to give notice to him to join the proceedings, prior to passing the impugned order.
12.
 In view of the above discussion, we accept this Constitution petition and declare that impugned order passed by the Ombudsman to have been without lawful authority, void ab initio and of no legal effect as such, the matter pertaining to a civil dispute and the parties are left at liberty to invoke the Court of competent jurisdiction for redressal of their grievances. No order as to costs.

 JAWAD HASSAN, J.---
Through this appeal, the Appellants have called in question the order rendered in W.P. No.31061/2014 dated 22.01.2015 passed by the learned Single Judge (the ""Impugned Order""), whereby the constitutional petition of the Respondent was allowed.
2.
 Brief facts for the disposal of instant appeal are that earlier the Respondent filed W.P. No.22214/2011 for provision of electricity connection to his premises which was remitted to the Appellants vide order dated 13.09.2012 with a direction to look into the grievance of the Respondent. The Appellants refused the request of the Respondent vide order dated 25.03.2013 for the reason that his residence is situated in Housing Scheme Gulshan-e-Azeem Sialkot. Feeling aggrieved by the said order the Respondent filed W.P. No.31061/2014 which was allowed vide the impugned order. Hence, this Appeal.
3.
 Learned counsel for the Appellants submitted that the impugned order is against law and facts as the same has been passed by ignoring the fact that providing the electricity connection to the Respondent whose resident is situated at Link Burj Road, Mian Sialkot Daska Road (the ""Property"") i.e. within the Housing Society, is totally against the policy of GEPCO Limited unless the entire Housing Society is not electrified; that the running of 11KV system close to the Housing Society is not ground for providing electricity to an individual.
4.
 On the other hand learned counsel for the Respondent submitted that the writ petition has rightly been allowed as there is no illegality in the impugned order. Learned counsel also contended that to enjoy the facility of electricity is right to every citizen of Pakistan including the Respondent and that too when the same has been provided to the other persons of the locality; that he has been provided the connection by the SNGPL of the gas supply; that no one can be deprived from his/her fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the ""Constitution""), as such the instant Appeal is liable to be dismissed.
5.
 We have heard the arguments of the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the record.
6.
 From the perusal of record it reveals that the Respondent has appended with the writ petition copy of application dated 01.08.2011 for Domestic Three Phase Connection, in which he specifically mentioned that his house is not situated in any Housing Society; that a number of electricity connections have already been provided to many of the inhabitants of the locality; that he has been provided connection of sui gas; that he is ready to bear all the expenditures that may occur. The Respondent has also appended along with the petition copy of NOC issued by the Tehsil Municipal Administration showing no objection on provision of electricity connection to the Respondent as the residential building plan has been approved by the TMA. The perusal of record further depicts that in the application dated 21.05.2014 given to the Chief Executive Officer, GEPCO the Respondent has mentioned that he has purchased the land from Zarqa Qayyum, a private owner of the land and that the sponsors of the alleged colony could never get preliminary NOC from the TMA Sialkot during the last ten (10) years nor they are interested to make a housing scheme. Record further reveals that the said Colony is under objection which has not been removed so far.
7.
 From the above, it is crystal clear that the residential building plan of the Respondent has been approved by the TMA and they have no objection on provision of electricity connection. It is noticeable here that the TMA vide letter dated 09.05.2014 has stated that the residential building plan of the Respondent has been approved but vide letter dated 08.11.2014, showing the status of the said Gulshan Azeem Colony Daska Road, Sialkot, has stated that the approval of the Society is pending due to objections duly conveyed to applicants on 08.08.2009 but the applicants have not cleared the objections hence the layout plan is unapproved yet. The status of pendency is also conveyed to Government for information. From the above, it is explicit that the approval of the society has not been given by the TMA. In the report and parawise comments the Appellants have mentioned that it has passed the order in terms of its Policy of the Department, whereby in a housing society, if the electrification is not connected by the sponsors, the electric connection cannot be sanctioned in favour of the individual consumer. It means that it is the Policy of the Respondents-Department that without electrification in a housing society, no individual is allowed to have an electricity connection, separately. But in the present case the situation is different, as admittedly, the alleged housing society has not yet been approved/registered by the Authority, as such does not have the status of a 'Housing Society'. The Respondent has also produced letter dated 22.04.2015, issued by the Tehsil Municipal Administra-tion, Sialkot, through which the Respondent has been intimated that the plan of subject colony submitted by Ch. Azeem Safdar and others in TMA Sialkot has been rejected by this office, therefore, the Respondent cannot be refused supplying electricity connection because there exists no housing society and the said policy cannot have its effect upon the case of the Appellant.
8.
 The order dated 13.04.2017 passed by this Court in the instant Appeal reveals that in compliance of this Court's order the demand notice dated 12.04.2017 amounting to Rs.2,40,500/- has been delivered to the Appellants/Department in the Court, therefore, now the Respondent cannot be denied from issuance of electricity connection as a substantial right has been accrued in his favour. Undeniably, the Respondent is the citizen of this country and the Constitution guarantees fundamental rights to every citizen. This Court is meant to protect and enforcement of the fundamental rights of the citizens which are being infringed by anyone. To enjoy the facility of electricity is fundamental right of the all the citizens under the Constitution and particularly, in the present era when life seems to be impossible without electricity. The Respondent has given application for Domestic Three Phase Connection for his house which is admittedly his fundamental right, as such the learned Single Judge has rightly observed in the impugned order that to provide electricity to the Respondent is his fundamental right which cannot be denied in any manner and has also placed reliance on the case titled Mehar Muhammad Nawaz, Ex-OG-I, Small Business Finance Corporation Multan v. Managing Director, Small Business Finance Corporation and 2 others 2009 SCMR 187.
9.
 We fully agree with the finding of the learned single Judge who allowed the petition directing the appellants to provide electricity connection to the Respondent's premises as it is his fundamental right. In view of above circumstances, we see no illegality or jurisdictional error in the impugned order which has been passed in line with the dictates of law and does not warrant any interference by this Division Bench.
10.
 Resultantly, the instant Appeal is devoid of any merit and is accordingly dismissed.

5,ABDUL HAMEED Versus State,"June 12, 2017",KARACHI HIGH COURT SINDH, Honorable Justice Adnan-ul-Karim Memon ,2018 YLRN 75,"ORDER
 ADNAN-UL-KARIM MEMON, J.---
The Applicants namely Abdul Hameed Shaikh and Danish Gul Chandio are seeking Post Arrest Bail in a case Crime No.41/2017, under section 285, 286, P.P.C. and Section 3/4 Prohibition (Enforcement of Had) Order 1979, registered at Police Station Taluka, District Larkana. Applicants moved bail application twice in above crime before learned Judicial Magistrate-Ill, Larkana and the same were dismissed vide order dated 15.4.2017 and 28.4.2017 respectively. Thereafter, Applicants moved bail applications twice before learned Sessions Judge, Larkana which were also dismissed vide order dated 19.4.2017 and 20.5.2017 respectively.
2.
 The gist of allegations against the Applicants according to the FIR is that on 12.04.2017 ASI Abdul Sattar Khatyan of Police Station Taluka, Larkana alongwith subordinate staff i.e. PC-Oshaq Ahmed and PC-Hakim Ali were on patrol duty. During patrolling, when they reached Indus Highway Larkana, they received spy information about one Blue Car carrying certain objectionable material. Upon seeing the said car, they signaled to stop, search was conducted and found one person sitting on the rear seat of car with packets of explosives comprising of 1400 boxes in 4 sacks and three cartons containing 60(20 bottles in each carton) tin bottles of beer/alcohol respectively. The aforesaid recovered items were sealed and secured under Mushirnama. On inquiry, the driver of car disclosed his name as Abdul Hameed son of Akbar Ali Shaikh, resident of Shaikh Muhalla, Kamber. The person who was sitting on rear seat of car disclosed his name as Danish Gul son of Ali Gul Chandio, resident of Kamber Ali Khan. Accused persons and recovered property were brought at Police Station and FIR was lodged under Section 285,286 of PPC and Section 3/4 Prohibition (Enforcement of Had) Order, 1979 on behalf of the State.
3.
 Investigating Officer of the case prepared Mushirnama of place of incident, recorded statements of prosecution witnesses, interrogated the Applicants, got conducted chemical examination of recovered alcohol, obtained its report and submitted Charge Sheet against the Applicants on 20.04.2017.
4.
 Learned counsel for the Applicants argued that Applicants have falsely been implicated in the subject crime by the police with mala fide intention by concocting a story due to enmity. It is further asserted that Applicants are students who have no criminal record. They further added that nothing was recovered from the possession of Applicants and the /alleged recovery is foisted upon them. They next contended that there is /a violation of section 103 Cr.P.C. as no private person has been cited as witness from the Area where the alleged recovery was made despite the fact that place of incident is a very thickly populated area. Therefore, the case requires further inquiry to ascertain the guilt of the Applicants. They further argued that offences are not punishable with death or imprisonment for life. They next contended that section 3 Prohibition (Enforcement of Hadd) Order,1979 is not applicable in the present case, section 4 of Prohibition of (Enforcement of Hadd) Order,1979 is punishable up to two years and offences under Section 285 and 286 PPC are bailable, therefore Applicants are entitled for the concession of Bail as matter of right. The learned counsel for the Applicants in support of their contentions has placed reliance upon the case of Shah Nawaz and others v. The State (2008 SCMR 1436), Muhammad Ummer v. The State (PLD 2004 SC 477), Saeed Ahmed v. The State (1996 SCMR 1132), Munawar Hussain Talat v. The State (2005 YLR 1215)and Muhammad Siddiq v. The State (1988 PCr.LJ 947).Per learned counsel in the light of the aforesaid case law the punishment provided for the alleged offences is less than three years, which becomes bailable. Therefore, the case of Applicants does not fall within the prohibitory clause of section 497(1) of Cr.P.C. Learned counsel further asserted that alleged recovered case property i.e. tin bottles of beer/alcohol were sent for chemical analysis after considerable delay of five days without any plausible explanation. Therefore, the Chemical Examination Report has lost the presumption of authenticity and cannot be considered at bail stage.
5.
 Learned Addl. Prosecutor General for the State has opposed the grant of bail and argued that Applicants were arrested at the spot while transporting 1400 boxes of explosives packed in 4 sacks and three cartons containing 20 each tin bottles of ::,eer/ alcohol. He next argued that Chemical Examination Report and statements of witnesses fully supported the prosecution case. He next contended that Applicants have been charged with offences punishable under Section 3/4 Prohibition (Enforcement of Hadd) Order, 1979 read with sections 285 and 286, P.P.C. which are of serious nature. He next argued that Applicants are charged with allegations of transport and possession of explosive material and 60 tin bottles of beer/Alcohol containing 6.5 % V/V Ethyl Alcohol in huge quantity. He next contended that Prosecution has collected sufficient incriminating evidence against the Applicants and if the bail is granted the Applicants will continue to commit similar criminal activities causing harm to the public at large. Therefore, the Applicants are not entitled to the concession of bail. In support of his contentions he relied upon the case of IMTIAZ AHMED and others v. THE STATE (PLD 1997 SC 545). He further added that learned Trial Court rejected bail applications of the Applicants twice on merits vide order dated 15.4.2017 and 28.4.2017 respectively, as well as learned Sessions Court, Larkana vide respective orders dated 19.4.2017 and 20.5.2017.
6.
 I have heard learned counsel for the Applicants and learned Addl. P.G. for the State, perused the material available on record and case law cited at the Bar.
7.
 I am conscious of the fact that while deciding a bail application, 1 this Court has to consider the allegations made in the FIR, statements /recorded under section 161, Cr.P.C., nature and gravity of charge, other incriminating material against the accused, legal pleas raised by the accused and the relevant law.
8.
 Record reflects that Applicants have been arrested red-handed with 1400 boxes of explosive material packed in total 4 sacks and sixty tin bottles of beer/Alcohol. Per Chemical Examination Report, the aforesaid material/parcel contains 6.5% V/V as Ethyl Alcohol. The recovery of above specified explosive substance and alcohol was duly witnessed by police officials. The perusal of record does not reflect any ostensible reason on the part of police which could indicate false implication of the Applicants. Therefore, police official are as good witnesses as any other person.
9.
 Insofar as the plea taken by the learned counsel for the Applicants with respect to non-association of private witnesses is concerned, the complainant has explained the same in the FIR that incident took place at odd hours of the night. And, plea of enmity is a factual controversy which cannot be looked into at bail stage, as deeper appreciation of I; evidence is not required to be considered at bail stage because only tentative assessment of the record is to be made.
10.
 Prima facie the offence falls under Section 3 and 4 Prohibition;. (Enforcement of Hadd) Order, 1979 read with section 285 and 286, P.P.C. and section 3 is punishable up to five years imprisonment, which are of serious nature. Apparently, sufficient incriminating material has been collected by the police against the Applicants.
11.
 It is well settled principle of law that an offence which does not fall/within the prohibitory clause of section 497(1), Cr.P.C. does not become a bailable offence automatically. Therefore, if the circumstances warrant bail can be refused even in respect of offences not falling under the prohibitory clause of section 497(1), Cr.P.C.
12.
 The case law cited by the learned counsel for the Applicants are distinguishable from the facts and circumstances of the present case.
13.
 In view of the above, I am of the opinion that Applicants have failed to make out a case for grant of bail at this stage. Accordingly, the instant bail application is dismissed.
14.
 The findings mentioned above are tentative in nature which shall not prejudice the case of either party at the trial stage. However, the learned Trial Court is directed to record evidence of the material witnesses within a period of two months where after the Applicants will be at liberty to move fresh bail application before the learned Trial Court on fresh ground, if they so desire.
15.
 Above are the reasons of short order dated 06.6.2017.

6,ZAHID HUSSAIN Versus State,"June 12, 2017",PESHAWAR HIGH COURT, Honorable Justice Abdul Shakoor ,2018 YLRN 147,"ORDER
 ABDUL SHAKOOR, J.---
Petitioner, Zahid Hussain, seeks his release on bail in case FIR No.362 dated 14.05.2017 under sections 15-AA/5 Explosive registered at Police Station, Daudzai, Peshawar.
2.
 The brief facts of the case are that on 14.05.2017 at 2030 hours, the complainant, Syed Sardar Ali Shah, SHO Police Station Daudzai was on combining operation in the, area, he also conducted raid at the house of one Ijaz son of Mir Ahmad Shah, who is a proclaimed offender in case FIR No.69 dated 27.1.2017 registered under sections 302/ 324/34, P.P.C. of Police Station, Daudzai, Peshawar was wanted by the police, but the said P.O. was not found at his house, however, the police party found the present accused/ petitioner in the house of said P.O. The personal search of the accused/petitioner led to the recovery of a 9 MM Pistol bearing No.013008-10-CN-236 loaded along with 26 live rounds of the same bore and 03 hand grenades. The accused/ petitioner could not produce any valid license or permit for carrying the said deadly weapons and explosives, hence the FIR.
3.
 The learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the accused/ petitioner is innocent and has falsely been implicated in the case with ulterior motive by the police; Further contended that under Section 7 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908 permission of the Provincial Government must be obtained but in the instant case no permission has yet been obtained. Further submitted that there is no mentioned serial numbers with regard to hand grenades; that there is no independent evidence against the accused/petitioner on the file as required under section 103, Cr.P.C.; Learned counsel for petitioner further argued that the accused/petitioner is first offender and never involved previously in such like cases; and that the charge levelled against the accused/petitioner requires further probe into his guilt and as such, he is entitled to the concession of bail. Learned counsel for the petitioner placed reliance on case titled Shah Zaman v. The State (2012 MLD 410), Habib-ur-Rehman v. The State (2012 YLR 665), Zain-ul-Abidin v. The State (2010 MLD 173) and Karamat Khan v. The State (2011 YLR 1390).
4.
 On the other hand, the learned AAG on behalf of State opposed the arguments of learned counsel for the petitioner and contended that the accused/ petitioner is directly charged in the FIR and recovery has been effected from his personal possession. Further contended that the offence, with which the petitioner is charged heinous in nature and also falls within the prohibitory clause of section 497, Cr.P.C. In these circumstances, the accused/petitioner is not entitled to the concession of bail.
5.
 I have heard learned counsel for the petitioner, learned AAG on behalf of State and perused the available record with their assistance.
6.
 Perusal of record would show that no permission/sanction from the Provincial Government/ competent authority is available on record, as required under Section 7 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908, for holding a trial in the case of accused/petitioner, which is mandatory. The record would further reveal that no public witness of the locality as required under section 103, Cr.P.C. was associated with the recovery proceedings. The Expert report is also not available on record to ascertain as to whether the recovered arms and ammunition were in working condition or not. The recovery of three hand grenades from one side pocket is also intolerable/impossible and also no serial number has been mentioned of the said hand grenades and thus case of the accused/petitioner is made out that of further inquiry. Besides, the petitioner is behind the bars since his arrest and there is no prospect of conclusion of his trial in the near future.
7.
 For the reasons discussed above, the instant bail application is allowed and the accused/petitioner is admitted to bail subject to furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs.2,00,000/- with two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate. The sureties must be reliable and men of means.
8.
 Above are the reasons of my short order of even date.

7,MUJAHID HUSSAIN NAQVI Versus AZAD JAMMU AND KASHMIR BAR COUNCIL,"June 12, 2017",HIGH COURT AZAD KASHMIR, Honorable Justice M. Tabassum Aftab Alvi ,2017 PLD 59,"JUDGMENT
 M. TABASSUM AFTAB ALVI, C.J.---
The supra titled writ petition has been addressed under Section 44 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act, 1974 whereby vires of the impugned notification dated 05th April, 2017, through which license of Advocacy of petitioner was cancelled by the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Bar Council, on the basis of stricture made by the apex Court through its order dated 21st March, 2017, has been challenged for having been issued as without lawful authority.
2.
 Precise facts culminating into filing of the instant writ petition are that petitioner was enrolled as an Advocate of the High Court on 14th September, 1981. After completing prescribed period of practice, he was enrolled as an Advocate of the Supreme Court on 23rd July, 1983. The apex Court previously referred the matter of misconduct of petitioner to the Bar Council under Section 38 by suspending his legal practice while exercising powers under Section 51 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Bar Council Act, 1995, through judgment dated 11th May, 2010. However, as Disciplinary Committee could not dispose off complaint within a period of 03 months, therefore, order of suspension pertaining to legal practice of petitioner was declared as vacated by afflux of time, by the apex Court through order dated 2nd May, 2011. The petitioner moved an application before the Supreme Court, in Review Petition No.2/2016, titled ""Mujahid Hussain Naqvi v. Azad Govt. and others"" for adjournment on the ground of ailment, stating therein, that his brain activity reduced to 75%, however, certain observations were passed against him by the apex Court through order dated 21st March, 2017. The matter was, however, referred to Bar Council and consequently on the basis of observations made by the Supreme Court, license of petitioner was abrogated by the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Bar Council, through the impugned notification dated 05th April, 2017. Against the aforesaid impugned notification petitioner previously filed Writ Petition No.721/2017 and impleaded parties to Hon'ble Senior Judge of the Supreme Court, as well as Registrar of the Supreme Court, as respondents Nos.6 and 7, in the said writ petition. The single Bench of this Court solicited comments with show cause from all respondents through order dated 26th April, 2017, however later on, when the aforesaid fact came in the notice of the Bench seized with the matter that Hon'ble Judge of the Supreme Court was also impleaded party by name, the said writ petition was returned in original to petitioner vide order dated 27th April, 2017, hence, the instant subsequent writ petition.
3.
 The petitioner himself argued case and submitted that Azad Jammu and Kashmir Bar Council, issued the impugned notification dated 05th April, 2017, whereby his license of advocacy was unlawfully abrogated on the basis of order of the Supreme Court without providing him an opportunity of hearing. He contended that through order dated 21st March, 2017, the apex Court only referred the matter to Bar Council for detailed report, however, the Bar Council, cancelled his license in colorable exercise of powers in hasty manner, hence, submitted for admission of writ petition.
4.
 We have perused the contents of writ petition and examined the appended documents as well as service record of petitioner made available with utmost care.
5.
 A perusal of record reveals that Hon'ble Senior Puisne Judge, of the apex Court passed following stricture against petitioner through order dated 21st March, 2017:-
3. Mr. Mujahid Hussain Naqvi, advocate, petitioner, has moved an application for seeking adjournment on the ground of ailment. The relevant contents of the application read as under:-
""That the petitioner who is a known patient of 'reactive depression' owing to having remained constantly in stress-oriented atmosphere since 6th March, 2017 has undergone a recurrent attack of the ailment. And has been constrained to restart heavy intoxicating drugs, which keep his brain drowsy and half asleep. Resultantly his brain activity goes reduced to 75%. He is thus not in a befitting position to appear before the Hon'ble Court and participate in proceedings sharply and with full effectiveness.""
After going through the contents of the application, Mr. Raza Ali Khan, the learned Advocate-General, who is also the Chairman of AJ&K Bar Council, was called to the rostrum to apprise the Court, who stated that according to his information, Mr. Mujahid Hussain Naqvi is not holding valid license of the AJ&K Bar Council. After such statement by the Chairman Bar Council, the position has become more aggravate, which requires thorough probe in the light of the provisions of Legal Practitioners and Bar Council Act, 1995. I would also like to observe here that in a number of cases, Mr. Mujahid Hussain Naqvi, Advocate, has moved such like applications. Yesterday, in a case titled Mujahid Hussain Naqvi v. Ansr Mehmood Awan and others, he also moved an application wherein he mentioned that his brain activity has reduced to 75%. From the previous record/ pleadings of Mr. Mujahid Hussain Naqvi it depicts that he mostly used contemptuous/scandalizing language to undermine the authority of the Court, which is not expected from a lawyer. I am of the view that this may be due to his ailment, which is supported by different medical certificates/applications submitted by him in different cases. However, to his latest stance taken in the application alarming and serious which cannot be taken lightly. In this scenario, his further continuation in legal profession does not appear to be in the interest of legal profession.""
 'Underlining is ours for emphasizing.
6.
 It appears from the impugned notification dated 05th April, 2017, that license of petitioner was cancelled by the Bar Council, on the basis of the aforesaid stricture of the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The petitioner impliedly challenged the vires of the aforesaid observations through the instant constitution petition. We are afraid, the stricture supra, on the basis of which, the impugned notification was issued cannot be expunged by this Court, hence, writ petition is not maintainable. The petitioner could prefer a review petition before the apex Court against the aforesaid observations for expunging the remarks, within 30 days as per the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Supreme Court Rules, 1978.
7.
 A perusal of memorandum of writ petition reveals that petitioner impleaded Shoukat Ali Kiyani, Advocate/Vice Chairman Bar Council, Chaudhary Khalid Yousaf, Advocate, Chairman Executive Committee Bar Council, Registrar Supreme Court of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Chairman Disciplinary Committee, Azad Jammu and Kashmir Bar Council as respondents Nos. 3, 4, 6 and 7, respectively. No any reasons whatsoever, has been shown that why the aforesaid respondents have been impleaded in the line of respondents. The petitioner previously filed Writ Petition No.721/2017 and impleaded Hon'ble Senior Puisne Judge of the Supreme Court, as well as Registrar of the Supreme Court, as respondents Nos.6 and 7, which petition was returned in original to him vide order dated 27th April, 2017. The petitioner again impIeaded the same Hon'ble Senior Puisne Judge, who recorded judgment dated 09th October, 2012, through which Government notification dated 09th May, 1998, pertaining to dismissal from service of petitioner was restored, whose lordship is Chairman of Disciplinary Committee, in the line of respondents without any lawful justification. It is an admitted fact that no proceedings were ever initiated by Chairman Disciplinary Committee against petitioner, therefore, writ petition merits dismissal due to mis-joinder of parties, hence, we are not inclined to exercise our extraordinary constitutional jurisdiction in favour of petitioner.
8.
 As per service record of petitioner, he was Secretary to Government BPS-20, however, on the ground of committing forgery and tampering in orders of the Prime Minister, was reverted from BPS-20 to BPS-19,. and then in BPS-18 to BPS-17 and lastly he was reverted as Information Officer BPS-16, and ultimately was dismissed from service vide Government notification dated 09th May, 1998. Against the aforesaid Govt. notification, petitioner filed Writ Petition No.215/1998, titled ""Mujahid Husain Naqvi v. Azad Govt. and others"", before this Court, which was accepted vide order dated 05th October, 1999. Against the aforesaid order, Azad Government and others filed an appeal before the apex Court, in which difference of opinion arose between two Hon'ble Judges of the Supreme Court, resultantly, matter was placed before third Judge, who was at the then time, the Hon'ble Chief Justice (Mr. Justice Sardar Said Muhammad Khan). The appeal filed by Government and others was accepted vide judgment dated 09th October, 2012. He later on moved an application for recalling judgment dated 09th October, 2012, which was also turned down by the apex Court through order dated 05th December, 2015. Meanwhile petitioner succeeded to obtain an order dated 26th October, 2014, from the Prime Minister for reinstatement in Service, then promotion in BPS-21 since 02nd December, 1997 and then retirement on reaching superannuation w.e.f. 27th September, 2009. The order was not acted upon, hence, he filed Writ Petition No.2277/2014, titled ""Mujahid Hussain Naqvi v. Azad Govt. and others"" which was dismissed by Division Bench of this Court handed down by me (Justice M. Tabassum Aftab Alvi, C.J.) with the other member of Bench (Justice Muhammad Sheraz Kiani, J.) vide judgment dated 08th June, 2017. In this regard paragraphs 9, 10 and 11 of the said judgment are reproduced as follows:-
""9. A perusal of application of petitioner reveals that petitioner has deliberately concealed the judgment of the apex Court dated 09.10.2012, and by suppressing fact succeeded to obtain a void order of his reinstatement and promotion in BPS-21 since 02.12.1997, as well as retirement after attaining age of superannuation w.e.f 27.09.2009, who has not invoked jurisdiction of this Court with clean hands, therefore, is not entitled to equitable relief of writ jurisdiction.
10. The petitioner, therefore, filed the instant writ petition with unclean hands which is ex-facie frivolous, as well as, contemptuous to frustrate the judgment and order of the apex Court of the country.
11. The contention of petitioner that he remained almost unconscious from 2010 to 2015, seems to be falsified. A perusal of judgment of the apex Court dated 09.10.2012, makes it abundantly clear that he himself argued his case and pleaded each and every point pertaining to prove his dismissal order as unlawful and each point was authoritatively resolved by the apex Court of the country. He later on also moved an application for recalling judgment dated 09.10.2012, which too was argued by him. The application was turned down by the Hon'ble Court through order dated 05.12.2015, which proved that his assertion about unconsciousness since 2010 to 2015. is falsified. Even otherwise the aforesaid point has not been raised by petitioner in memorandum of his writ petition. It is well settled principle of law that a party cannot be allowed to argue its case vis-a-vis to pleadings ..""
9.
 The petitioner concealed the aforesaid fact of his dismissal from service from the Bar Council, who as per Section 24 subsection (2) of AJ&K Legal Practitioner and Bar Council Act, 1995, could not be allowed to practice as lawyer, for five years, which is reproduced as follow: -
 ""24. Persons qualified for admissions as Advocates
:- (1)
 (a) ..
 (b) .
 (c) .
 
 (i) 
 
 (ii) ..
 
 (iii) .
 (d) 
 (e) 
 (2) A person shall be disqualified from being admitted as an advocate if:-
(i) he was dismissed or removed from service of Government or of a public statutory corporation or a charge involving moral turpitude; unless a period of five years, or such less period as the Government may, by notification in the official Gazette, specify in this behalf, has elapsed since his dismissal or removal; or
 (ii) 
 (iii) ..
 (3) ..
10.
 The petitioner, therefore, remained in the legal profession till cancellation of his license vide notification (sic) dismissed Civil Servant, hence, is not entitled to equitable relief of writ jurisdiction even from this angle.
11.
 The petitioner obtained license to practice in the Judicature of High Court of Azad Jammu and Kashmir on 14th September, 1981, while obtained license of the Supreme Court on 23rd July, 1983. The Azad Jammu and Kashmir Bar Council Act, 1995, was promulgated on 31st December, 1995. At the time of promulgation of the Act, 1995, petitioner was a Civil Servant, hence, was not practicing Advocate. As per record, he was dismissed from service, vide Govt. notification dated 09th May, 1998. After dismissal from service and promulgation of Act, 1995, it appears that he never informed to the Bar Council about his dismissal from service. It reflects that name of petitioner was never inserted in the roll of Advocates maintained by the Bar Council, in accordance with provisions of Sections 21(a), 22(a) and 23(a) of the Act, 1995. Therefore, according to our considered view, petitioner is not entitled to practice in the legal profession till completion of statutory period as postulated under subsection (2) of Section 24 of Act, 1995.
12.
 The legal profession is known as a noble profession having high traditions and has been catering to the need of the society for a very long time past. Thus, the members of legal fraternity are expected to uphold those traditions and serve the society with utmost respect to Courts, sincerely and honestly. If such are the expectations from a noble profession, its members must conduct themselves which may be worthy of emulation. By doing any act which is contrary to the accepted norms and standards of the aforesaid professions, a member of the legal fraternity not only discredits himself but also brings disrepute to the profession to which he belongs. By such acts the credibility and reputation of the profession as a whole comes under cloud. If any member of the profession falls from such standards, he deserves punishment commensurate with the gravity of misconduct. The conduct of petitioner even before this Court in numberless cases also displayed that his further continuation in legal profession does not appear to be in the interest of legal profession.

 SYED MANSOOR ALI SHAH, C.J.---
This judgment will decide the maintainability of the instant petition, as well as, connected Writ Petition No.23578/2016.
2.
 Petitioner has challenged the constitutionality of the geographical allocation of quotas amongst Provinces and other Areas in the national Competitive Examination of the Central Superior Services (CSS) 2015. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that allocation of quota to various Provinces and Areas is in violation of Article 27 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. It is submitted that the period envisaged in the proviso to Article 27(1) i.e., forty years from the commencing day, has long expired and, therefore, the geographical quotas allocated for CSS-2015 by the Federal Public Service Commission (FPSC) vide Press Note dated 13.04.2016 are unconstitutional and illegal.
3.
 At the very outset, M/s Nasar Ahmed, DAG, Anwaar Hussain, Additional Advocate General, Amanullah Kanrani, Advocate General, Balochistan, Syed Ali Raza, Advocate General, AJK and Malik Akhtar Hussain Awan, Assistant Advocate General, KPK raised a preliminary objection regarding the maintainability of the titled petition. They submitted that any interference by this Court would amount to issuing a writ outside the territorial limits of the Court, in as much as, it will affect the rights and privileges (quota) of people belonging to other Provinces and Areas, which is not permissible under Article 199 of the Constitution. They also oppose the main case on merits but that need not be gone into at this stage.
4.
 Messrs Kh. Isaam Bin Haris and Mushtaq Ahmad Mohal Advocates, appearing on behalf of the petitioners submitted that the impugned Press Note has been issued by the Federal Government and there are numerous instances when notifications issued by the Federation and even the federal laws are challenged before this Court and often struck down. Therefore, this Court can also examine the impugned Press Note, which is no different. They placed reliance on Ahmad Yar Chohan v. Federal Public Service Commission and 2 others (1998 MLD 1832) and Mushtaq Ahmad Mohal and others v. The Honourable Lahore High Court, Lahore and others (1997 SCMR 1043) in support of their contentions.
5.
 Considering the gravity of the constitutional question, notices were issued to the Advocates General of other provinces to solicit their viewpoint. Amanullah Kanrani, AG, Balochistan Syed Ali Raza, Advocate General, AJK and Malik Akhtar Hussain Awan, Assistant Advocate General, KPK have tendered appearance and submitted that it would be constitutionally appropriate if the matter is taken up by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan. They submitted that this Court cannot issue a writ affecting the rights or quotas of the people or residents of another Province.
 Mr. Rafey Altaf, Advocate/amicus curiae submits that this Court has jurisdiction to entertain the matter. He submits that in terms of Article 199(2) of the Constitution this Court cannot shy away from enforcing the Constitution. He placed reliance on Messrs Sethi and Sethi Sons through Humayun Khan v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Islamabad and others (2012 PTD 1869), K.B. Threads (Pvt.) Limited through Chief Executive and others v. Zila Nazim, Lahore (Amir Mehmood) and others (PLD 2004 Lahore 376) and High Court Bar Association and others v. Government of Balochistan through Secretary, Home and Tribal Affairs Department and 6 others (PLD 2013 Balochistan 75).
7.
 Mr. Saad Rasool, Advocate/amicus curiae submits that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain this matter as it amounts to transgressing its territorial jurisdiction. He submits that any interference by this Court would take away quota allocated to other Provinces, which is not within the jurisdiction of this Court and can best be dealt with by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan.
8.
 I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and the learned amici curiae. The case law cited at the bar and the relevant provisions of the Constitution have been examined. Preliminary objection regarding maintainability of this petition raises an important constitutional question i.e., Whether the High Court while granting relief to people within its own territorial jurisdiction can simultaneously affect the rights and privileges enjoyed by people in other Provinces? Whether, in such a unique situation, issuance of a writ by this Court is impermissible (hence not maintainable) or inappropriate?

 The above Press Note allocates quota to four Provinces, Gilgit Baltistan, FATA and AJK for the purposes of CSS Examination-2015. It is important to underline that the Press Note lays down a national quota allocation scheme. This allocation cannot be read in isolation for Punjab. 50% quota allocated to Punjab is not separable and cannot be sliced away without affecting the ratios allocated to other Provinces and Areas. The countrywide quota system envisaged in the Press Note is inter-linked and together constitutes a total of 100%. This is a unique case, where any intervention by this Court would upset the equilibrium of national quota system structured for CSS-Examination 2015 and affect the rights and privileges of the people of other Provinces, having smaller quotas.
10.
 What is the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 199? Article 175 states that there shall be a High Court for each Province and no court shall have any jurisdiction save as is or may be conferred on it by the Constitution or by or under any law. The jurisdiction conferred on the High Court under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 is as under:-
199. Jurisdiction of High Court
.---(1) Subject to the Constitution, a High Court may, if it is satisfied that no other adequate remedy is provided by law,--
(a)
 on the application of any aggrieved party, make an order---
(i)
 directing a person performing, within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court, functions in connection with the affairs of the Federation, a Province or a local authority, to refrain from doing anything he is not permitted by law to do, or to do anything he is required by law to do; or
(ii)
 declaring that any act done or proceeding taken within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court by a person performing functions in connection with the affairs of the Federation, a Province or a local authority has been done or taken without lawful authority and is of no legal effect; or
(b)
 on the application of any person, make an order 
(i)
 directing that a person in custody within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court be brought before it so that the Court may satisfy itself that he is not being held in custody without lawful authority or in an unlawful manner; or
(ii)
 requiring a person within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court holding or purporting to hold a public office to show under what authority of law he claims to hold that office; or
(c)
 on the application of any aggrieved person, make an order giving such directions to any person or authority, including any Government exercising any power or performing any function in, or in relation to, any territory within the jurisdiction of that Court as may be appropriate for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights conferred by Chapter 1 of Part II. (emphasis supplied)
Article 201 provides that any decision of a High Court to the extent it decides a question of law or is based upon or enunciates a principle of law shall be binding on all courts subordinate to it. Similarly, Article 202 provides that the High Court may make rules regulating the practice and procedure of any court subordinate to it. While Article 203 provides that High Court shall supervise and control all courts subordinate to it.
11.
 Constitutional terms like ""High Court for each Province"" ""within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court"" and ""all courts subordinate to it"" construct a High Court, which has a provincial character. The term ""within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court"" ubiquitously recurs throughout Article 199 emphasizing the territorial limitation on the jurisdiction of a High Court. The term ""All courts subordinate to it"" repeated in Articles 201, 202 and 203 place the Provincial High Court atop a provincial pyramidical hierarchy of courts. Constitutional architecture of a Provincial High Court provides that while it enjoys judicial power to examine all laws or actions of the federal, provincial and local governments or authorities, it can only do so if the cause of action arises or the respondent government or authority is located or if the impugned act or order affects a person within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court i.e., within the Province. As a corollary, the relief granted or the writ issued by the High Court also remains within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court and can only benefit or affect a person within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court. The relief cannot go beyond the Provincial boundary and affect any other Province or Area or its people. So for example, if a federal law or federal notification is struck down by Lahore High Court, it is struck down for the Province of Punjab or in other words the federal law or the federal notification is no more applicable to the Province of Punjab but otherwise remains valid for all the other Provinces or Areas. Unless of course the Federation or the federal authority complying with the judgment of the Lahore High Court, make necessary amends or withdraw the law or the notification. Which of course would then be open to challenge by the other Provinces or Areas or their people, if they so decide. The other eventuality is that the Federation or the federal authority may or may not enforce the said law or notification in other Provinces, as a matter of administrative decision and instead challenge the judgment of the Lahore High Court before the apex Court of the country. These are the operational repercussions and effects of a judgment, setting aside a federal law or federal notification or decision. However, on a purely constitutional and legal plane, the federal law or federal notification remains in existence for the rest of the country but for the Province of Punjab. This is further fortified by the fact that in case the same federal law or federal notification is challenged in any other Province or Area, the High Court concerned is not bound by the decision of the Lahore High Court and can declare the same federal law or federal notification to be valid law (Reference Article 201 of the Constitution). Therefore, under our Constitution, while our High Courts can judicially examine and strike down a federal law or federal notification, in fact, the said federal law or notification is made non-applicable to the extent of the Province unless the matter is finally decided by the Supreme Court of Pakistan or else if the Federation or the federal authority decide to withdraw or amend the law on their own, in compliance of the judgment.
12.
 What does ""Within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court"" mean? Relying on our constitutional jurisprudence developed over the years and the provincial constitutional architecture of a High Court, writ cannot be issued by High Court against any person which is located geographically outside the territorial limits of the Province, having no physical or legal presence within the Province. See: Sandalbar Enterprises (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Central Board of Revenue and others (PLD 1997 SC 334), Flying Kraft Paper Mills (Pvt.) Ltd., Charsadda v. Central Board of Revenue, Islamabad and 2 others (1997 SCMR 1874), Asghar Hussain v. The Election Commission Pakistan (PLD 1968 SC 387), Messrs Al-Iblagh Limited, Lahore v. The Copyright Board, Karachi and others (1985 SCMR 758) and Messrs Sethi and Sethi Sons through Humayun Khan v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Islamabad and others (2012 PTD 1869).
13.
 It is trite law that if the order or action of the Government or Authority (federal or provincial), present within the Province, affect the rights of a person within the Province, writ can be issued against the said Government or Authority (irrespective of its federal character) and relief given to the aggrieved person located within the Province.
14.
 The impugned Press Note dated 13.04.2016 does this and more, as it provides for quota for all the Provinces. Granting the prayer of the petitioner and striking down the Press Note would grant relief to the people of Punjab but simultaneously upset quotas belonging to the people of other Provinces and Areas. This would amount to issuing a writ beyond the territorial limits of the Court. A Provincial High Court can only grant relief to people of the Province and cannot meddle into the affairs of the other Provinces or affect the rights and privileges of the people of the other Provinces or Areas. 50% quota allocated to the Province of Punjab under the impugned Press Note is not inseparable from the quotas allocated to the other Provinces, hence striking down the Press Note will deprive the quota allocated to all the other Provinces and Areas. Any such writ issued by this Court would also amount to transgressing the territorial limits of the Province. So while technically, for the sake of argument, writ can be issued and relief can be granted to the people of Punjab by abolishing their quota, it would also, at the same time, have the effect of abolishing the quota of other Provinces and Areas. This unique situation begs the question; whether issuance of a writ as prayed for in this case, is constitutionally impermissible or inappropriate?
15.
 In order to answer the above question, let's revisit the federalist structure of our Constitution. ""The commonly accepted features of a federal constitution are: (i) existence of two levels of government; a general government for the whole country and two or more regional governments for different regions within that country; (ii) distribution of competence or power - legislature, executive, judicial, and financial between the general and the regional governments; (iii) supremacy of the constitution that is, the foregoing arrangements are not only incorporated in the constitution but they are also beyond the reach of either governments to the extent that neither of them can unilaterally change nor breach them; (iv) dispute resolution mechanism for determining the competence of the two governments for exercising any power or for performing any function. Federalism is in fact the basis of the division of powers...The principle of Federalism is a central organizational theme of the constitution and represents a political and legal response to underlying social and political realities... A federal system of government allows different provinces to pursue specific policies tailored to the particular concerns and interests of residents in that province. The Principle of Federalism also enables provinces to enact specific statues to pursue specific collective goals, and may promote different cultures and linguistic minorities within a specific province or areas. At the same time federalism allows citizens to construct and achieve goals on a national scale through a Federal Government acting within the limits of its jurisdiction. Consequently, federalism is key to enable citizens to participate in different collectivities and to pursue objectives at local, provincial and national levels.
16.
 Federalism or Federal Principle under our Constitution envisages independent federating units with autonomous legislature, executive and judiciary. Chapter 1 of Part V of the Constitution provides for distribution of legislative power between the Federation and the Provinces. Chapter 2 of the same Part deals with distribution of executive power between the Federation and the Provinces. Chapters 1 to 3 of Part-VII deal with Judicature and the vertical sharing of jurisdiction between the Supreme Court of Pakistan and the High Courts, as well as, the horizontal jurisdictional limits between the High Courts. The Constitution provides a separate High Court for each Province and a Supreme Court of Pakistan with an overarching jurisdiction with an overlapping power with the High Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution. The provincial jurisdictional limits, delineating judicial power between co-ordinate High Courts on the basis of territory and the vertical overlap of judicial power under Article 184(3) between the High Court and the Supreme Court of Pakistan is judicial federalism. Every Provincial High Court and the High Court of the Islamabad Capital Territory has its own jurisdictional space. Any order passed by a High Court is, therefore, effective in the Province and has merely a non-binding persuasive value in other Provinces. Province is a federating unit and has its own legislature, executive and judiciary. Similarly, within the Province, the provincial High Court also functions on the same Federal Principle and exercises judicial power within the limited provincial jurisdictional space or within the Islamabad Capital Territory.
17.
 This Court while it enjoys the power to sit in judgment over the quota allocated to Punjab, the power under Article 199 of the Constitution is ""subject to the Constitution"" and will remain subject to the federal principle discussed above. In the present case the quota in question is inter-linked and combined with the quotas of the other Provinces and any interference by this Court will affect national allocation of quota in other Provinces and Areas. As relief cannot be granted to a person in Punjab without depriving the allocation of quota of the people of other Provinces, such a relief or writ issued by this Court will amount to travelling beyond the territorial limits of the Province and offend the federal principle and the core value of the Constitution.
18.
 It is also important to bear in mind, that theoretically, any other Provincial High Court can easily protect its own provincial quota by protecting the impugned Press Note or declaring it to be intra vires the Constitution. As other High Courts are not bound by the decision of the Lahore High Court, the possibility of multiple decisions or interpretations of the same federal law or federal notification cannot be ruled out, leaving behind the FPSC in total chaos, which could only be settled by the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Therefore, in a matter, where enforcement of a decision of a High Court is not possible, is it proper to exercise jurisdiction?
19.
 Another dimension of the case is the principle of forum non conveniens which is a discretionary power that allows courts to dismiss a case where another court, or forum, is much better suited to hear the case. This dismissal does not prevent a plaintiff from refiling his or her case in the more appropriate forum: The doctrine allows a court with jurisdiction over a case to dismiss it because the convenience of the parties and the interest of justice would be better served if the case were brought in a court having proper jurisdiction in another venue. ""The doctrine of forum non conveniens, i.e., that some other forum is more ""appropriate"" in the sense of more suitable for the ends of justice, was developed by the Scottish courts in the nineteenth century, and was adopted (with some modifications) in the United States. The Scots rule is that the court may decline to exercise jurisdiction, after giving consideration to the interests of the parties and the requirements of justice, on the ground that the case cannot be suitably tried in the Scottish court nor full justice be done there, but only in another court. The basic principle is that.... the court is satisfied that there is some other available forum, having competent jurisdiction, which is the appropriate forum for the trial of the action, i.e. in which the case may be tried more suitably for the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice. Applying this principle to the facts of the present case, the matter in hand, can best be resolved at the Supreme Court of Pakistan.
20.
 Considering the principles discussed above, if impugned Press Note dated 13.04.2016, for the sake of argument, is struck down by this Court it will not only abolish the Punjab quota but also the quota of other Provinces for the purposes of CSS Examination. I am, therefore, of the considered view that interference by this Court would be constitutionally inappropriate and impermissible. Therefore, for the multiple reasons narrated above, I decline to exercise jurisdiction in this matter and leave the parties to approach the august Supreme Court of Pakistan for the redressal of their grievance, if so advised.
21.
 This petition is, therefore, dismissed.

 The above Press Note allocates quota to four Provinces, Gilgit Baltistan, FATA and AJK for the purposes of CSS Examination-2015. It is important to underline that the Press Note lays down a national quota allocation scheme. This allocation cannot be read in isolation for Punjab. 50% quota allocated to Punjab is not separable and cannot be sliced away without affecting the ratios allocated to other Provinces and Areas. The countrywide quota system envisaged in the Press Note is inter- linked and together constitutes a total of 100%. This is a unique case, where any intervention by this Court would upset the equilibrium of national quota system structured for CSS-Examination 2015 and affect the rights and privileges of the people of other Provinces, having smaller quotas.

 What is the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 199? Article 175 states that there shall be a High Court for each Province and no court shall have any jurisdiction save as is or may be conferred on it by the Constitution or by or under any law. The jurisdiction conferred on the High Court under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 is as under:-
199. Jurisdiction of High Court
.---(1) Subject to the Constitution, a High Court may, if it is satisfied that no other adequate remedy is provided by law,--
(a)
 on the application of any aggrieved party, make an order---
(i)
 directing a person performing, within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court, functions in connection with the affairs of the Federation, a Province or a local authority, to refrain from doing anything he is not permitted by law to do, or to do anything he is required by law to do; or
(ii)
 declaring that any act done or proceeding taken within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court by a person performing functions in connection with the affairs of the Federation, a Province or a local authority has been done or taken without lawful authority and is of no legal effect; or
(b)
 on the application of any person, make an order 
(i)
 directing that a person in custody within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court be brought before it so that the Court may satisfy itself that he is not being held in custody without lawful authority or in an unlawful manner; or
(ii)
 requiring a person within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court holding or purporting to hold a public office to show under what authority of law he claims to hold that office; or
(c)
 on the application of any aggrieved person, make an order giving such directions to any person or authority, including any Government exercising any power or performing any function in, or in relation to, any territory within the jurisdiction of that Court as may be appropriate for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights conferred by Chapter 1 of Part II. (emphasis supplied)
Article 201 provides that any decision of a High Court to the extent it decides a question of law or is based upon or enunciates a principle of law shall be binding on all courts subordinate to it. Similarly, Article 202 provides that the High Court may make rules regulating the practice and procedure of any court subordinate to it. While Article 203 provides that High Court shall supervise and control all courts subordinate to it.
11.
 Constitutional terms like ""High Court for each Province"" ""within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court"" and ""all courts subordinate to it"" construct a High Court, which has a provincial character. The term ""within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court"" ubiquitously recurs throughout Article 199 emphasizing the territorial limitation on the jurisdiction of a High Court. The term ""All courts subordinate to it"" repeated in Articles 201, 202 and 203 place the Provincial High Court atop a provincial pyramidical hierarchy of courts. Constitutional architecture of a Provincial High Court provides that while it enjoys judicial power to examine all laws or actions of the federal, provincial and local governments or authorities, it can only do so if the cause of action arises or the respondent government or authority is located or if the impugned act or order affects a person within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court i.e., within the Province. As a corollary, the relief granted or the writ issued by the High Court also remains within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court and can only benefit or affect a person within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court. The relief cannot go beyond the Provincial boundary and affect any other Province or Area or its people. So for example, if a federal law or federal notification is struck down by Lahore High Court, it is struck down for the Province of Punjab or in other words the federal law or the federal notification is no more applicable to the Province of Punjab but otherwise remains valid for all the other Provinces or Areas. Unless of course the Federation or the federal authority complying with the judgment of the Lahore High Court, make necessary amends or withdraw the law or the notification. Which of course would then be open to challenge by the other Provinces or Areas or their people, if they so decide. The other eventuality is that the Federation or the federal authority may or may not enforce the said law or notification in other Provinces, as a matter of administrative decision and instead challenge the judgment of the Lahore High Court before the apex Court of the country. These are the operational repercussions and effects of a judgment, setting aside a federal law or federal notification or decision. However, on a purely constitutional and legal plane, the federal law or federal notification remains in existence for the rest of the country but for the Province of Punjab. This is further fortified by the fact that in case the same federal law or federal notification is challenged in any other Province or Area, the High Court concerned is not bound by the decision of the Lahore High Court and can declare the same federal law or federal notification to be valid law (Reference Article 201 of the Constitution). Therefore, under our Constitution, while our High Courts can judicially examine and strike down a federal law or federal notification, in fact, the said federal law or notification is made non-applicable to the extent of the Province unless the matter is finally decided by the Supreme Court of Pakistan or else if the Federation or the federal authority decide to withdraw or amend the law on their own, in compliance of the judgment.
12.
 What does ""Within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court"" mean? Relying on our constitutional jurisprudence developed over the years and the provincial constitutional architecture of a High Court, writ cannot be issued by High Court against any person which is located geographically outside the territorial limits of the Province, having no physical or legal presence within the Province. See: Sandalbar Enterprises (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Central Board of Revenue and others (PLD 1997 SC 334), Flying Kraft Paper Mills (Pvt.) Ltd., Charsadda v. Central Board of Revenue, Islamabad and 2 others (1997 SCMR 1874), Asghar Hussain v. The Election Commission Pakistan (PLD 1968 SC 387), Messrs Al-Iblagh Limited, Lahore v. The Copyright Board, Karachi and others (1985 SCMR 758) and Messrs Sethi and Sethi Sons through Humayun Khan v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Islamabad and others (2012 PTD 1869).
13.
 It is trite law that if the order or action of the Government or Authority (federal or provincial), present within the Province, affect the rights of a person within the Province, writ can be issued against the said Government or Authority (irrespective of its federal character) and relief given to the aggrieved person located within the Province.
14.
 The impugned Press Note dated 13.04.2016 does this and more, as it provides for quota for all the Provinces. Granting the prayer of the petitioner and striking down the Press Note would grant relief to the people of Punjab but simultaneously upset quotas belonging to the people of other Provinces and Areas. This would amount to issuing a writ beyond the territorial limits of the Court. A Provincial High Court can only grant relief to people of the Province and cannot meddle into the affairs of the other Provinces or affect the rights and privileges of the people of the other Provinces or Areas. 50% quota allocated to the Province of Punjab under the impugned Press Note is not inseparable from the quotas allocated to the other Provinces, hence striking down the Press Note will deprive the quota allocated to all the other Provinces and Areas. Any such writ issued by this Court would also amount to transgressing the territorial limits of the Province. So while technically, for the sake of argument, writ can be issued and relief can be granted to the people of Punjab by abolishing their quota, it would also, at the same time, have the effect of abolishing the quota of other Provinces and Areas. This unique situation begs the question; whether issuance of a writ as prayed for in this case, is constitutionally impermissible or inappropriate?
15.
 In order to answer the above question, let's revisit the federalist structure of our Constitution. ""The commonly accepted features of a federal constitution are: (i) existence of two levels of government; a general government for the whole country and two or more regional governments for different regions within that country; (ii) distribution of competence or power - legislature, executive, judicial, and financial between the general and the regional governments; (iii) supremacy of the constitution that is, the foregoing arrangements are not only incorporated in the constitution but they are also beyond the reach of either governments to the extent that neither of them can unilaterally change nor breach them; (iv) dispute resolution mechanism for determining the competence of the two governments for exercising any power or for performing any function. Federalism is in fact the basis of the division of powers...The principle of Federalism is a central organizational theme of the constitution and represents a political and legal response to underlying social and political realities... A federal system of government allows different provinces to pursue specific policies tailored to the particular concerns and interests of residents in that province. The Principle of Federalism also enables provinces to enact specific statues to pursue specific collective goals, and may promote different cultures and linguistic minorities within a specific province or areas. At the same time federalism allows citizens to construct and achieve goals on a national scale through a Federal Government acting within the limits of its jurisdiction. Consequently, federalism is key to enable citizens to participate in different collectivities and to pursue objectives at local, provincial and national levels.
16.
 Federalism or Federal Principle under our Constitution envisages independent federating units with autonomous legislature, executive and judiciary. Chapter 1 of Part V of the Constitution provides for distribution of legislative power between the Federation and the Provinces. Chapter 2 of the same Part deals with distribution of executive power between the Federation and the Provinces. Chapters 1 to 3 of Part-VII deal with Judicature and the vertical sharing of jurisdiction between the Supreme Court of Pakistan and the High Courts, as well as, the horizontal jurisdictional limits between the High Courts. The Constitution provides a separate High Court for each Province and a Supreme Court of Pakistan with an overarching jurisdiction with an overlapping power with the High Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution. The provincial jurisdictional limits, delineating judicial power between co-ordinate High Courts on the basis of territory and the vertical overlap of judicial power under Article 184(3) between the High Court and the Supreme Court of Pakistan is judicial federalism. Every Provincial High Court and the High Court of the Islamabad Capital Territory has its own jurisdictional space. Any order passed by a High Court is, therefore, effective in the Province and has merely a non-binding persuasive value in other Provinces. Province is a federating unit and has its own legislature, executive and judiciary. Similarly, within the Province, the provincial High Court also functions on the same Federal Principle and exercises judicial power within the limited provincial jurisdictional space or within the Islamabad Capital Territory.
17.
 This Court while it enjoys the power to sit in judgment over the quota allocated to Punjab, the power under Article 199 of the Constitution is ""subject to the Constitution"" and will remain subject to the federal principle discussed above. In the present case the quota in question is inter-linked and combined with the quotas of the other Provinces and any interference by this Court will affect national allocation of quota in other Provinces and Areas. As relief cannot be granted to a person in Punjab without depriving the allocation of quota of the people of other Provinces, such a relief or writ issued by this Court will amount to travelling beyond the territorial limits of the Province and offend the federal principle and the core value of the Constitution.
18.
 It is also important to bear in mind, that theoretically, any other Provincial High Court can easily protect its own provincial quota by protecting the impugned Press Note or declaring it to be intra vires the Constitution. As other High Courts are not bound by the decision of the Lahore High Court, the possibility of multiple decisions or interpretations of the same federal law or federal notification cannot be ruled out, leaving behind the FPSC in total chaos, which could only be settled by the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Therefore, in a matter, where enforcement of a decision of a High Court is not possible, is it proper to exercise jurisdiction?
19.
 Another dimension of the case is the principle of forum non conveniens which is a discretionary power that allows courts to dismiss a case where another court, or forum, is much better suited to hear the case. This dismissal does not prevent a plaintiff from refiling his or her case in the more appropriate forum: The doctrine allows a court with jurisdiction over a case to dismiss it because the convenience of the parties and the interest of justice would be better served if the case were brought in a court having proper jurisdiction in another venue. ""The doctrine of forum non conveniens, i.e., that some other forum is more ""appropriate"" in the sense of more suitable for the ends of justice, was developed by the Scottish courts in the nineteenth century, and was adopted (with some modifications) in the United States. The Scots rule is that the court may decline to exercise jurisdiction, after giving consideration to the interests of the parties and the requirements of justice, on the ground that the case cannot be suitably tried in the Scottish court nor full justice be done there, but only in another court. The basic principle is that.... the court is satisfied that there is some other available forum, having competent jurisdiction, which is the appropriate forum for the trial of the action, i.e. in which the case may be tried more suitably for the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice. Applying this principle to the facts of the present case, the matter in hand, can best be resolved at the Supreme Court of Pakistan.
20.
 Considering the principles discussed above, if impugned Press Note dated 13.04.2016, for the sake of argument, is struck down by this Court it will not only abolish the Punjab quota but also the quota of other Provinces for the purposes of CSS Examination. I am, therefore, of the considered view that interference by this Court would be constitutionally inappropriate and impermissible. Therefore, for the multiple reasons narrated above, I decline to exercise jurisdiction in this matter and leave the parties to approach the august Supreme Court of Pakistan for the redressal of their grievance, if so advised.
21.
 This petition is, therefore, dismissed.

10,MUHAMMAD LAIQ alias SUHNO Versus State,"June 12, 2017",KARACHI HIGH COURT SINDH, Honorable Justice Zafar Ahmed Rajput ,2018 PCrLJ 227,"ORDER
 ZAFAR AHMED RAJPUT, J.---
Through instant Criminal Bail Application, under section 497 of Cr.P.C., the applicant/accused, namely, Muhammad Laiq alias Suhno son of Dodo Khan seeks post-arrest bail in case FIR No.04 of 2017, registered under section 9(c) of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 (hereinafter ""the Act"") at Police Station Rehmatpur, Distt. Larkana. His earlier application for grant of bail being No. 290 of 2017 was rejected by the learned Special Judge C.N.S. Act, Larkana, vide order dated 18.03.2017.
2.
 Briefly stated facts of the case are that on 18.01.2017, upon receiving spy information during patrolling that the applicant/accused was going from Chandka Bridge to Bazigar Bridge hauling Charas, the complainant S.I.P. Ali Bashir Jagirani of C.I.A., Larkana, along with subordinate staff, reached the pointed place at 1700 hrs., and arrested the accused on being found in possession of three packets of Charas in black polythene bag, which was on being equalized came to three K.Gs., the same was sealed by him at the spot, thereafter, he brought the accused along with case property at police station Rehmatpur where aforesaid FIR was recorded.
3.
 Learned counsel for the applicant/accused has contended that the accused is innocent and has falsely been implicated in this case by the C.I.A. police, who arrested the accused from Nazar Muhallah two days before lodging of the FIR; that despite advance information, the complainant did not associate any private mashir, which has rendered the alleged recovery doubtful; that as per FIR, C.I.A. police recovered three packets of Charas, while the report of chemical analyzer shows that each packet contained two slabs, but the number of slabs have neither been mentioned in the FIR nor even in the memo of recovery, hence no credibility can be attached to alleged recovery; that there is delay of five days in sending the case property to chemical analyzer and no explanation for such delay has been furnished by the prosecution; that as per Ghulam Murtaza's case (PLD 2009 Lahore 362) the alleged offence is punishable for five years and six months, as such, the alleged offence does not fall within the prohibitory clause of section 497, Cr.P.C., hence, the accused is entitled to the concession of bail. In support of his contentions, the learned counsel for the accused has relied upon the case of Ikramullah and others v. The State (2015 SCMR 1002) Waheed Raza Pathan v. The State (2011 YLR 2760) Maqsood Zaman v. The State (2011 YLR 2335) Muhammad Mudasir v. The State (2010 YLR 2910).
4.
 Conversely, the learned A.P.G has vehemently opposed the grant of bail to accused on the grounds that a huge quantity of Charas has been recovered from the possession of accused; that the alleged recovery has been effected from the accused in presence of two official witnesses against whom no ill-will or enmity has been pleaded by the accused; that as per FIR due to non-availability of the private persons at the spot, the C.I.A officials acted as mashirs; that Ghulam Murtaza's case has no application at the bail stage and it is the trial Court that shall decide the quantum of punishment after trial of the accused.
5.
 Heard the learned counsel for the accused as well as A.P.G. for the State and perused the material available on record with their assistance so also the case-law cited by the learned counsel for the accused.
6.
 It appears prime facie that three K. Gs. Charas has been recovered from the accused, who is facing charge under section 9(c) of the Act. The punishment provided under clause (c) of section 9 of the Act for possessing, narcotic drug, psychotropic substance or controlled substance, exceeds from 1 kilogram, is either for death, imprisonment for life or for a term which may extend to fourteen years with fine, which may be up to one million rupees. The entire Charas was sent to chemical examiner for analysis and his report in this regard is positive.
7.
 While considering the submissions made by the learned counsel for the accused, I have tentatively found that the accused was arrested by C.I.A. police but the investigation was conducted by S.I.P Imdad Ali of P.S. Rehmatpur against whom no enmity has been alleged by the accused. It has been mentioned in the FIR, that due to non-availability of private person, the C.I.A. official were made mashirs of recovery. Even otherwise association of any private mashir is not the requirement of the Act in view of Section 25 of the Act, which has excluded the applicability of section 103, Cr.P.C. in narcotics cases. Reliance in this regard may be placed on the case of Zafar v. The State (2008 SCMR 1254). Non-mentioning of the number of slabs in the FIR and memo of recovery is also not fatal to the persecution case when the number of packets has been mentioned. I am also not convinced of the arguments of learned counsel for the accused with regard to delay in sending the case property to chemical analyzer, for the reasons that the alleged recovery was effected from the accused on 18.01.2017 and the case property was deposited with the office of chemical analyzer on 23.01.2017, which was day of Monday and since the office of chemical analyzer's remained closed on Sunday, it was deposited on fifth day. Even otherwise, delay of few days in sending the case property to chemical analyzer is of no consequence for the reasons that Rule 4 of Control of Narcotic Substances (Government Analysts) Rules, 2001, which prescribes 72 hours for sending the contraband articles to Chemical Analyzer, is directory and not mandatory.
8.
 As regard the sentencing policy, formulated by the full bench of honourable Lahore High Court in the case of Ghulam Murtaza (supra), I am in agreement with the learned APG that the same has no application on the case of the accused at the bail stage, as held by the honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Socha Gul v. The State (2015 SCMR 1077).
9.
 So far the case-law cited by the learned counsel for the accused is concerned; I am of the humble view that the same are not applicable in the case of present accused being on distinguishable facts. I am; therefore, of the view that, prima facie, sufficient material is available on record to connect the accused with the commission of alleged offence and no case for granting bail to accused has been made out. Hence, instant bail application is dismissed, accordingly.
10.
 Needless to mention here that the observations made hereinabove are tentative in nature and would not influence the trial Court while deciding the case of the applicant/accused on merits.

11,RIZWAN SHABBIR KIYANI Versus State,"June 12, 2017",ISLAMABAD, Honorable Justice Aamer Farooq ,2018 PCrLJ 20,"JUDGMENT
 AAMER FAROOQ, J.---
The instant Criminal Revision is directed against orders dated 18.05.2017 as well as 23.05.2017 passed by Judicial Magistrate (1st) Class (West), Islamabad and Sessions Judge (West), Islamabad respectively.
2.
 The facts, leading to the filing of instant petition, are that a FIR (FIR No.52-2017) dated 01.03.2017 was lodged at P.S. Margalla, Islamabad under sections 394/511, P.P.C. In the referred FIR, certain persons were nominated as accused. The police investigated the matter and after that, filed report under section 173, Cr.P.C. before respondent No.4 i.e. Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class (West), Islamabad/Area Magistrate, P.S. Margalla, Islamabad. Supplementary police report was submitted in the FIR adding offence under section 337-A(iii), P.P.C. before learned Judicial Magistrate. The referred court, on 18.05.2017, observed that since the offences are not triable by Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, therefore the matter be placed before the Sessions Judge (West), Islamabad for appropriate orders. On 23.05.2017, the learned Sessions Judge, Islamabad entrusted the matter to the learned Magistrate, Section 30, P.S. Margalla, Islamabad.
3.
 Learned counsel for the petitioner, inter alia, submitted that the procedure adopted by the learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Islamabad-West/respondent No.4 as well as the Sessions Judge/respondent No.2 is not in accordance with law and is contrary to the provisions of section 190(2) as well as 193, Cr.P.C. In this behalf, it was contended that reference could only be made to the Sessions Judge concerned, if the offence is exclusively triable by the Sessions Court whereas in the instant case, the offences are triable by the Sessions Court or Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class; that if at the time of passing sentence, if the Magistrate concerned is of the opinion that the sentence, he wishes to award to the accused, is beyond jurisdiction only then, the matter shall be referred to the Sessions Court for the said purpose. In the alternative, it was argued that even if, the Magistrate at the inception is of the opinion that the matter is beyond jurisdiction, then he may return the report under section 173, Cr.P.C. for filing of the same before the court of competent jurisdiction, but cannot send reference as was done in the instant case. In support of their contentions, learned counsel placed reliance on cases reported as 'Wasaya and others v. Sikandar Hayat and others' (2012 SCMR 193), 'Mohsin Ali v. Additional Sessions Judge, Faisalabad and another' (PLD 2013 Lahore 12) and 'Rao Fahd Ali Khan v. The State and another' (2014 PCr.LJ 1071).
4.
 Learned counsel for the accused entered appearance and submitted that offence is to be tried by Judicial Magistrate, Section 30 and Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, is not competent. It was further contended that the instant petition is just a dilating tactic on behalf of petitioner to delay the adjudication of the trial and hearing of the bail petition filed by the accused. In support of their contentions, learned counsel placed reliance on cases reported as PLD 2017 Lahore 106 and PLD 2013 Lahore 12.
5.
 Schedule-II to the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 provides the table of offences provided in Pakistan Penal Code and inter alia the Court by which the same are to be tried. In this behalf, offences under sections 337-A(iii) and 394, P.P.C. are to be tried by Court of Session or Magistrate, 1st Class and section 511, P.P.C. by the court which the offence attempted is triabe. Hence, in the instant case, the offences are triable by the court of session or the Magistrate, 1st Class. Under section 190(1) of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Cr.P.C.), all Magistrates of the 1st Class or any other Magistrate specially empowered by the Provincial Government on the recommendation of the High Court, may take cognizance of an offence, upon receiving a complaint of facts, which constitute such offence; upon a report in writing of such facts made by any police officer; upon recommendation received from any person other than police officer or upon his knowledge of suspicion with such offence has been committed, which he may try or send to the Court of Session for trial. Under subsection (2) of section 190, Cr.P.C. the Magistrate, taking cognizance under subsection (1) of an offence triable exclusively by a Court of Session, shall without recording any evidence, send the case to the court of session for trial. Under section 190, Cr.P.C., the report under section 173, Cr.P.C. is to be filed by the police before the concerned Magistrate and if he is of the opinion that such offence is committed, he may try the offence or send to the court of Session for trial. Where a Magistrate takes cognizance of a case exclusively triable by a Court of Session, he shall without recording any evidence, send the case to the Court of Session for trial.
6.
 In the instant case, the offences in question are triable either by Court of Session or Magistrate of 1st Class. Since the offences are not exclusively triable by the Court of Session therefore the matter should not have been referred under section 190(2), Cr.P.C. Similarly, under section 193, Cr.P.C., the Court of Session is not to take cognizance of any offence as the court of original jurisdiction unless the case has been sent to it under section 190(2), Cr.P.C. by a Magistrate duly empowered in this behalf. The power/jurisdiction of the court of Magistrate to pass sentence is provided in section 32, Cr.P.C. and in this behalf, the court of Magistrate 1st Class may pass sentence of imprisonment for a trial not exceeding three years, however, under section 30 ibid, the Provincial Government may confer upon any Magistrate of the 1st Class with power to try as a Magistrate of offences not punishable with death. The maximum sentence attracted, in the instant case, is 10-years which is beyond the jurisdiction/competence of the Judicial Magistrate of 1st Class in light of section 32, Cr.P.C.
7.
 The procedure, which is adopted in such like cases, came under consideration before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in case reported as 'Wasaya and others v. Sikandar Hayat and others' (2012 SCMR 193) and it was observed that in terms of section 30, Cr.P.C., a Magistrate 1st Class is empowered to try all offences except those punishable with death. The matter was further lucidly discussed in case reported as 'Mohsin Ali v. Additional Sessions Judge, Faisalabad and another' (PLD 2013 Lahore 12) and it was observed as follows:-
""8. Now the question left for determination is whether offence under section 367, P.P.C. is triable by the Court of Session or by a Magistrate 1st Class having the powers under section 30 of Cr.P.C. The answer to this question is contained in the cases of Allah Wasaya and Noor Hussain (supra). It was observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in both precedent cases that the quantum of punishment does not itself take away the powers of taking cognizance or trying a case which should have been done under section 187 of the Sea Customs Act itself. It is further observed that the limit on the power of awarding punishment does not affect the competence of a Court to try a case. The Magistrate is duly competent to try the case but all that he cannot do is to impose a sentence which is in excess of his powers. In the case of Allah Wasaya (supra), it was observed by the apex Court that in terms of section 30 of Cr.P.C. a Magistrate of 1st Class could try all offences except those punishable with death. In this case the offence charged against the culprits was under section 336, P.P.C., which was triable by Court of Session as per 2nd Schedule of Code (supra). These judgments make one thing clear that mere quantum of punishment is not enough to take away the jurisdiction of the Court to try the offence. In this connection section 30 of the Code (supra) clearly manifests that the Magistrate of 1st Class may try all the offences the punishment of which does not involve sentence of death. In this respect it is further observed that 2nd Schedule of the Code, according to section 28(3) governs the cases triable by the Courts of different kind. This section cannot be read in isolation to section 30, which contains non obstante clause making an exception that a Magistrate can try all offences not punishable with death. This provision of the section 30, Cr.P.C. excludes applicability of section 28 in clear terms by making an exception to it in respect of Courts mentioned in the column 8 of 2nd Schedule. Accordingly, a Magistrate 1st Class with powers under section 30. Cr.P.C. has the jurisdiction to try all those offences, which are not punishable with death. In view of this legal position, one can say safely that the order passed by the Judicial Magistrate on 4-11-2010 by sending Reference to learned Sessions Judge for entrusting the case to the Court of Session as offence under section 367, P.P.C. not triable by it, is an illegal exercise of jurisdiction by the Court concerned. Further the learned Sessions Judge had exercised its jurisdiction mechanically by entrusting the trial of the case to the Court of Addl. Sessions Judge without examining the fact that a Magistrate section 30 may try all the offences except those involving death sentence.""
Similarly, in case reported as 'Noor Hussain v. The State' (PLD 1996 Supreme Court 68), it was observed as follows:-
""Section 187 of the Sea Customs Act provides that all offences under the Sea Customs Act, except those cognizable under section 182, may be tried summarily by a Magistrate, provides that the Schedule thereto, so far as they concern special goods, they shall be tried by a Court having powers not inferior to those of a Magistrate of the First Class. It will be observed from this that the quantum of the punishment does not by itself take away the power of taking cognizance of or trying a case, which could have been done under section 187 of the Sea Customs Act itself. The limit on the powers of awarding punishment does not affect the competent of a Court to try the case. The Magistrate is duly competent to try the case but all that he cannot do is to impose a sentence which is in excess of his powers. In the present case, the sentence imposed, as already stated, was of the duration of two years which was well within the powers of a Magistrate of the First Class in accordance with the Third Schedule to the Criminal Procedure Code.""
In view of the above judgments mere fact that quantum of punishment is beyond the powers of a Magistrate is not enough to take away the jurisdiction of the court to try the offence. In the second Schedule to Cr.P.C, the offences in question are triable by Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class or Court of Session therefore the Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class does have the jurisdiction in the matter. The fact that the sentence prescribed for the offences in question is beyond the competence of the Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class would not take away his jurisdiction. Even otherwise, if a court is of the opinion that the matter is beyond jurisdiction/competence, reference cannot be send to the Session Court under section 190, Cr.P.C. rather report under section 173, Cr.P.C. is to be returned for filing of the same before the court of competent jurisdiction. Reference in this regard is placed on case reported as 'Rao Fahd Ali Khan v. The State and another' (2014 PCr.LJ 1071). In case reported as Hassan v. The State and another (PLD 2017 Lahore 106) the Honourable Lahore High Court observed as follows:-
10. Undoubtedly, an Assistant Sessions Judge is a judicial officer, who for all purposes, exercises powers whish vest in Magistrate Section-30 of the Code. Meaning thereby that a Magistrate Section-30 can rightly be termed as an Assistant Sessions Judge. In this way, a Magistrate Section-30 is not competent to impose sentence to an accused beyond 07 years' imprisonment.
11. From the above mentioned discussion, it is evident that competency of the learned Trial Court, being Magistrate Section 30 was to award maximum sentence of 07 years' R.I. In this way, as provided under Section 439(3) of the Code, the learned revisional court was not competent to enhance the sentence, beyond jurisdiction of the learned Trial Court.
8.
 In view of above, instant Criminal Revision is allowed. The impugned orders dated 18.05.2017 as well as 23.05.2017 are set aside. Consequently, the report under section 173, Cr.P.C. shall be deemed to be pending before Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, P.S. Margalla Islamabad, who shall act in accordance with law and observations made hereinabove.

12,IFTIKHAR AHMAD Versus State,"June 12, 2017",PESHAWAR HIGH COURT, Honorable Justice Rooh-ul-Amin Khan ,2018 PCrLJ 440,"ORDER
 ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, J.---
Petitioner Iftikhar Ahmad, seeks bail in case FIR No.23 dated 10.03.2017, registered under section 9(c), Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997, in Police Station ANF RD, KP, Peshawar.
2.
 As per contents of FIR, on 10.03.2017 at 17.00 hours, on receipt of spy information qua trafficking of Acetic Anhydride (a chemical used in preparation of heroin), by Iftikhar Ahmad (present petitioner), in his Suzuki motorcar bearing registration No.BC.8491, Peshawar from Peshawar to Karkhano, Hafiz Sohail Umar Gondal, Inspector ANF along with other ANF personnel, conducted a barricade near Speen Jumat University Town Peshawar and at 17.00 hours, intercepted the aforesaid vehicle, being driven by the petitioner. On search, of the car, a cane having 4.500 Kgs Acetic Anhydride were recovered, out of which 10 Milliliter were separated for the purpose of chemical analysis by the FSL. The petitioner was arrested, hence, this case.
3.
 Learned counsel for the petitioner vehemently argued that the alleged recovered Acetic Anhydride is an acid used for multiple purposes i.e. drying clothes etc and can also be used for surfacing/polishing of heroin, hence cannot be held as narcotics drug defined under section 2(s) of the Act of 1997.
4.
 I am not impressed by the arguments of learned counsel for the petitioner for the reason that section 6 of the Act of 1997, says that no one shall produce, manufacture, extract, prepare, possess, offer for sale, sell, purchase, distribute, deliver on any terms whatsoever, transport, dispatch, any narcotic drug, psychotropic substance or controlled substance except for medical, scientific or industrial purposes in the manner and subject to such conditions as may be specified by or under this Act or any other law for the time being in force. Narcotic drug has been defined under section 2(s) of the Act of 1997 in the following manner:-
""Narcotic drug"" means coca leaf, cannabis, heroin, opium, poppy straw and all manufactured drugs.""
Similarly, 
""psychotropic substance""
 is defined under section 2(za) of the Act of 1997, as under:-
""Psychotropic substance""
 means the substances, specified in the Schedule to this Act and such substances as the Federal Government may, by notification in the official Gazette, declare to be a psychotropic substance"".
According to definition of ""psychotropic substance"", psychotropic substance means the substances specified in the Schedule to this Act and such substances as the Federal Government may, by notification in the official Gazette, declare to be a psychotropic substance.
 Section 2-K of the Act of 1997 defines 
""Controlled substances"" 
means any substance, which may be used for the production or manufacture of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substance. The recovered contraband under the name of Acetic Anhydride falls within the ambit of ""manufacture drug"" as defined under section 2(q) of the Act, 1997 as well as notified in the official gazette made in pursuance of the recommendations of an International Drugs Control Convention and incorporated in Schedule-V (Controlled Chemicals), Division-II of Drugs of Abuse Controlled Chemicals, Equipment and Materials) Rules, 2001.
 As per scientific research the Acetic Anhydride is the primary substance for making heroin from opium and morphine. In view of the above, the possession of recovered chemical i.e. Acetic anhydride being a primary substance used for production of heroin is manifest contravention of the provisions of section 6, punishment for which has been provided under section 9 of the Act of 1997.
5.
 Reverting to the merit of the case, it appears from the record that petitioner has been arrested red handed on the spot and huge quantity of Acetic Anhydride, used in preparation of heroin, has been recovered from the diggi of the car which was in his explosive possession and control. The positive FSL report and statements of the recovery witnesses under section 161, Cr.P.C. substantiate the version of the Seizing Officer. Nothing is on the record to show any ill will or enmity of the of the PWs against the petitioner. On tentative assessment of the material discussed above, reasonable grounds exist which prima facie connect the petitioner with the commission of offence, hence, he is not entitled to the concession of bail.
6.
 Accordingly, this petition being meritless is hereby dismissed.

 ZAHEER-UD-DIN KAKAR, J.---
This criminal revision petition has been filed against the order dated 02.6.2016 ""the impugned order"", passed by the Special Judge, Anti-terrorism Court-I, Quetta ""the trial Court"" where the application under Section 23 of Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 (A.T.A., 1997) for transfer of the case to an ordinary court of criminal jurisdiction from Special Court was rejected.
2.
 Precisely stated, the facts of the case are that on.18.10.2011, the complainant lodged a case vide FIR No.205 of 2011, under sections 302, 147, 148, 149, P.P.C. at Shalkot Police Station, Quetta alleging therein that on the fateful day he was present on his duty. At about 11:50 a.m. he received information from his home that accused persons Mohabbat Khan, Salimullah, Kalimullah, Khalilullah, Khalil-ur-Rehman and Najibullah, who are his relatives came to his house and made firing as a result of which, his daughter namely Abrira aged about 16 years was seriously injured, later in time succumbed to injuries. The motive behind the act was abduction of Abrira in 2010 by the accused and her return by their (accused) mother. The persons nominated in the FIR were not arrested, thus, incomplete challan was submitted before the Court of Sessions Judge, Quetta. The proceedings of this case was stayed by this Court vide order dated 24.10.2014 till decision of the private complaint filed by the complainant.
3.
 Thereafter, Mst. Shani Qayum, the wife of (Abdul Qayum the complainant of FIR No.205 of 2011) filed an application under section 22-A, Cr.P.C. before the Court of Additional Sessions Judge-IV, Quetta for lodging of second FIR against the petitioners, but the trial Court rejected the application. The order upheld up to the Hon'ble Supreme Court. Thereafter, Mst. Shani Qayum filed a private complaint against the petitioners with the allegation of committing murder of deceased Abrira on account of honour killing.
4.
 On the complaint, the trial commenced and on 19.12.2013, the charge was framed by the Additional Sessions Judge-IV, Quetta to which the petitioner pleaded not guilty. Thereafter, the trial Court recorded statement of Mst. Shani and Dr. Ali Mardan, Medico-legal Officer. Thereafter, the complaint was transferred to the Anti-Terrorism Court-I, Quetta by the order of this Court. On 16.6.2015, Judge, Anti-Terrorism Court-I, Quetta framed charge under sections 302, 34, P.P.C. read with section 7 of ATA to which the petitioners pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The trial Court recorded statements of complainant Mst. Shani and Medico Legal Officer.
5.
 During pendency of the case, an application under section 23 of A.T.A., 1997 was moved on behalf of accused (petitioners). The trial Court through order dated 02.6.2016 rejected the application, hence this petition.
6.
 Learned counsel for the petitioners contended that the impugned order passed by the trial Court is against law and facts; that the trial Court has mis-appreciated the facts of the case; that the provisions of section 6, A.T.A., 1997 not attracted in this case, thus, the same is liable to be set aside and the case be transferred to an ordinary Court of criminal jurisdiction. In support of his contention, the learned counsel for the petitioner has placed reliance upon PLD 2016 SC 195.
7.
 On the other hand, the learned State counsel assisted by the learned counsel for respondent No. 1 opposed the petition and supported the impugned order.
8.
 We have heard, the learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the available record. In order to determine, as to whether an offence would fall within the ambit of section 6 the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, it is essential to have a glance over the allegations made in the private complaint, filed by Mst. Shani Qayum, in which she specifically stated that her daughter was murdered in the name of honour killing by the petitioners, material collected during the investigation and surrounding circumstances. It is also necessary to examine whether the ingredients of alleged offence have any nexus with the object of the case as contemplated under sections 6, 7 and 8 thereof. Whether a particular act is an act of terrorism or not, the motivation, object, design and purpose behind the said act is to be seen. It is also to be seen as to whether the said act has created a sense of fear and insecurity in the public or in a section of the public or community or in any sect, there is no cavil to the proposition that where action results in striking terror or creating fear, panic, sensation, helplessness and sense of insecurity among the people in the particular area it amounts to terror and such an action squarely falls within the ambit of section 6 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 and shall be triable by a Special Court, constituted for such purpose. On the above touchstone, if one goes through the record of the case, one could reach to an irresistible conclusion that the case of the petitioners does not fall within the ambit of Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. It is settled law that while deciding the question of jurisdiction, it would be necessary to examine that the ingredients of alleged offence has any nexus with the object of Anti Terrorism Act, 1997. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, in its landmark judgment titled as Khuda-e-Noor v. The State reported in PLD 2016 SC 195 defined section 6 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 and declared that the honour killing does not fall within the ambit of section 6 of ATA and transferred the case from the Anti-Terrorism Court to a Court of Ordinary jurisdiction. The relevant para 4 of the said judgment is reproduced herein below:
""The case in hand was a case of a private motive set up in the FIR and during the trial the motive setup in the FIR was changed by the prosecution and an element of honour killing was introduced but even that did not change the character of the offence which was nothing but a private offence committed in the privacy of a home with no design or purpose contemplated by section 6(1)(b) or (c) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. We have, thus, entertained no manner of doubt that the allegations leveled against the appellant and his co-accused in the present criminal case did not attract the jurisdiction of an Anti-Terrorism Court, the learned Sessions Judge. Mastung was not justified in transferring the case to an Anti-Terrorism Court and the High Court was also not legally correct to dismissing the appellants' revision petition. This appeal is, therefore, allowed, the impugned order passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Mastung as well as the High Court of Balochistan, Quetta set aside and it is declared that the appellants' case is to be tried by a Court of ordinary jurisdiction.""
9.
 Keeping in view, the dicta as laid down in the aforementioned judgment, we have no hesitation to reach at the irresistible conclusion that ingredients of section 6, ATA are not attracted in this case. Thus, the criminal revision petition is allowed and the impugned order dated 02.6.2016, passed by the trial Court is set aside. The Special Case No.102 of 2015 pending adjudication before the Anti-Terrorism Court-I, Quetta is transferred to the Court of Additional Sessions Judge-IV, Quetta, with direction to decide the case according to law, preferably within a period of three months.

 ABDULLAH BALOCH, J.---
This common judgment disposes of Constitutional Petition No.(T)103 of 2016 and Constitutional Petition No.(T) 80 of 2016 filed by the petitioner Muhammad alias Khuda Bakhsh son of Jalal resident of Baloch Abad Mand under Article 199 of Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan read with section 561-A, Cr.P.C. against the respondent with the following prayer.
""It is therefore, accordingly respectfully prayed that on the above explained circumstances the respondent No. 2 be directed to grant the benefit of section 382- B, Cr.P.C. and include the under trial period of the conviction in his sentence he further be directed to allow the special remission to the petitioner granted by the central as well as provincial Governments during his period of the convictions, in the interest of justice, equity and fairplay"".
2.
 Brief facts of the case are that the petitioner was booked in FIR No. 28 of 2006 under sections 365-A, 324, 353, 186 and 34, P.P.C. registered with Police Station Turbat on 3rd March, 2006.
3.
 After proper investigation, Challan was submitted before the learned Court of ATC Mekran at Turbat who after completion of trial convicted the petitioner under section 365-A read with section 7(e) of the Anti-Terrorism, Act, 1997 and also ordered that all the movable and immovable property of the accused be forfeited in favour of the state, vide judgment dated 27th May, 2006.
4.
 The said judgment was assailed before this Court vide Criminal Appeal No. 118 of 2006 and the same was dismissed vide judgment dated 27th November, 2006.
5.
 Thereafter the petitioner filed appeal before the honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan, which was dismissed, however, the benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C. was granted in favour of the petitioner.
6.
 The learned counsel for the petitioner contended that as principle of law, the rights of every prisoner are governed under the Jail Manual and Rules every prisoner is entitled for special remissions granted by the Federal and Provincial Government from time to time; that such remissions were refused by the jail authorities to the petitioner; that Article 25 of Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan protects the rights of each citizen of Pakistan to be treated equally, but the appellant was not treated at par rather was discriminated to be extended the benefit of special remissions, that the jail authorities mis-interpreted the law and mis-exercised their authority for not granting the benefit of such remission to the petitioner.
7.
 On the other hand, the learned DPG appearing on behalf of State has strongly opposed the arguments so advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioner and contended that the offence committed by the petitioner under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 whereby such remissions are not extended to such convicts. As envisaged under section 21-F of the Act 1997 wherein the concession of special remissions were not extended to the accused involved in cases of terrorism, as such, the petitioner is not entitled to claim for such remissions under the Act. He further contended that the conviction of the petitioner was upheld up to the honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan and nowhere the petitioner agitated for concession of such remissions to be extended to him, as such, at this belated stage, he could not claim for such remissions.
8.
 We have carefully considered the contentions raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as, the learned DPG and the case law cited by the learned counsel for petitioner.
9.
 It is settled principle of law that the provisions of Article 25(1) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan provides equal protection to the rights of all citizens of Pakistan. For convenience, Article 25 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan is reproduced herein below:-
Article 25. Equality of Citizens
.---(1) All the citizens are equal before law and are entitled to equal protection of law.
 (2) There shall be no discrimination on the basis of sex.
(3) Nothing in this Article shall prevent the State from making any special provision for the protection of women and children.
10.
 Bare perusal of Article 25 of Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan shows that all the citizens living in this country are equal before law and are entitled to equal protection of law i.e. all citizens subjected to law should be treated of similar nature and alike under all circumstances. The equality has to be between the persons and are placed in the same set of circumstances. Similarly, there should be one set of rules for every convict under any law and that the forum of trial and the procedure may be different and the punishment under same laws may be more stringent as compared to the other enactments, but after conviction should be governed under prison rules not under the law operating conviction.
11.
 The petitioner who has been sentenced and convicted by the ATA Court is not being granted special and ordinary remissions under the prison rules. The purpose of remission is to reform the prisoner that it may be incentive to reform towards prisoners and society.
12.
 Though under the provisions of section 21-F of ATA wherein no remission in any sentence was allowed to a person other than a child who is convicted and sentenced for any offence under the said Act only granted by the Government otherwise, section 10(d) of NAB Ordinance similarly has been inserted in the NAB Ordinance, which also shall not entitle any remissions to the convicted prisoner who is convicted and sentenced for any offence under such Ordinance.
13.
 Be that as it may, but keeping in view the provisions of Article 8(1)(2) of Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan wherein, the law inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights declared to be void, moreover, Article 25 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan provided that all the citizens living in this country are equally entitled for protection of law. Reliance is placed on the case of Saleem Raza and 31 others v. The State PLD 2007 Karachi 139 wherein the honourable full bench of Sindh High Court held that no reasonable classification could be attributed as per section 10(d), which singles out a particular class of convicts which are denied remissions, whereas other convicts similarly placed, the provision of section 10(d) of NAB Ordinance was declared as ultra vires of Constitution and liable to be struck down and all prisoners convicted under NAB Ordinance were entitled to such remissions as person convicted under ordinary law.
14.
 Accordingly, the provisions of section 21-F of Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 are declared as ultra vires of the Constitution in the case of Hammad Abbasi v. Superintendent Central Adiala Jail Rawalpindi reported in PLD 2010 Lahore 428 relevant portion whereof reproduced as under:-
12. ""In the light of what has been discussed above, and on the same principle, it is held that the denial of remission to ATA convicts and allowing the same qua those who were convicted under the Anti Corruption laws by the Provincial Government would again be discriminatory, besides, once the benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C. is granted to a convict, then how the benefit of remission can be withheld to that convict, thus the refusal of remission to such convict would tantamount to deprive the liberty of that convict within the contemplation of Article 9 of the Constitution, which provides that"" No person shall be deprived of life or liberty save in accordance with law.
13. For the foregoing reasons this petition is allowed with the result that section 21-F of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 is declared as ultra vires of the Constitution and is liable to be struck down and the Jail Authorities are directed to include all the remissions, which have been denied to petitioner per section 21-F of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997"".
15.
 In view of the aforesaid judgments, we are of the considered opinion that the denial of remissions to the petitioner/convict are discriminatory, besides, once the benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C. is granted to the convict then how the benefit of special or ordinary remissions could be withheld to the convict thus the refusal of such concession tantamounts to deprive the liberty to the convict within the contemplation of Article 9 of Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, which provides that "" No person shall be deprived of life and liberty save in accordance with law"".
16.
 For the forgoing reasons, we are inclined to accept this petition and direct respondent No. 2 Superintendent Central Jail Gadani, to extend all the benefit of special as well as ordinary remissions to the petitioner including with the benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C. from date of his trial till completion of his sentence.

 MUHAMMAD EJAZ SWATI, J.---
The appellant has challenged the validity of the judgment dated 13th June 2009 (hereinafter the ""impugned judgment"") passed by Special Judge Anti-Terrorism Court-I, Quetta (hereinafter the ""trial Court""), whereby the appellant Muhammad Hussain son of Akhtar Ali was convicted under sections 302(b), 109/34, P.P.C. read with sections 7(a) and 21-I of Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 (hereinafter the ""Act, 1997"") and sentenced to death as Tazir with fine of Rs.200,000/- as compensation to be paid to the legal heirs of each deceased i.e. Syed Arif Hussain and Asadullah and in default thereof to further suffer R.I. for two years with benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C. The appellant was further convicted under sections 324, 109, 34, P.P.C. read with sections 7(b) and 21-I of the Act, 1997 for causing grievous injuries to the injured Amjad Ali and sentenced to suffer R.I for 14 years with fine of Rs. 100,000/- as compensation to be paid to the legal heirs of injured Amjad Ali and in case of default thereof to further suffer R.I. for one year with benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C.
 Whereas the trial Court has also sent Murder Reference No. 16 of 2009 for confirmation of death or otherwise.
2.
 The brief facts of the instant case are that on the complaint of Syed Shah Hussain an FIR No. 07 of 2002 dated 27th January, 2002 under sections 302, 324, 109/34, P.P.C. read with sections 7-A and 21-I of the Act, 1997 was registered with Police Station Quaid Abad, Quetta, wherein it was alleged that the deceased Syed Arif was his nephew and on the fateful day, he was present at his house and received an information by phone that Syed Arif was injured, who had been taken to the hospital. He reached to the hospital at about 5:40 p.m., where he came to know that the said Syed Arif succumbed to the injuries. The complainant alleged that he came to know in the hospital that the friends of deceased Syed Arif namely Asadullah and Amjad Ali had also sustained injuries and further he was told that firing was made from a Gray Colour Pajero and in the said incident, Zia son of Ali Murad, Muhammad Hussain son of Akhtar Ali (appellant), Ali Ahmed son of Sabz Ali and Qurban son of Haji Ahmed Ali were involved. All the victims including the deceased had sustained injuries by means of Makarov Pistol. The motive behind the incident was that Qurban son of Haji Ahmed Ali and Syed Muhammad Ali, who is father of deceased, had a business relationship, which turned hostile. Haji Ahmad Ali advanced threats to the complainant that to tell his brother and Muhammad Arif to settle the account with him or in consequence the result would be dangerous. After registration of the FIR, the appellant remained fugitive and the case was tried against him in absentia, as such vide judgment dated 16th August 2003, he was awarded capital punishment. The appellant was arrested from Iran and brought to Quetta on 19th February 2007. Thereafter, he filed an appeal before this Court, which was accepted vide judgment dated 15th September 2008 and the case was remanded to the trial Court for commencing de novo trial of the appellant after providing him full opportunity of hearing in accordance with law. On 9th February 2009, the challan against the appellant was submitted and the charge was framed on 20th February 2009, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
3.
 The prosecution examined six witnesses. It is relevant to mention here that in the earlier round when the case was proceeded in absentia, the statement of one injured namely Amjad Ali (an eye-witness) was recorded by the trial Court, however, after arrest of the appellant, the said witness, according to the prosecution, had died. Whereon, the counsel for the complainant submitted an application along with death certificate of Amjad Ali issued by Nazim of the area, which was obtained by the third Investigating Officer of the case and the same was produced as Ex.P/6-A with the submission that the statement of PW Amjad be placed on record. The defence counsel opposed the contention of the complainant's counsel and prayed for rejection of the application. However, the trial Court allowed the application, as such statement of the aforesaid witness was placed on record.
4.
 When examined under section 342, Cr.P.C. the appellant denied the allegations of the prosecution. He neither examined himself on oath as envisaged under section 340(2), Cr.P.C. nor produced any witness in defence.
5.
 The trial Court vide impugned judgment convicted and sentenced the appellant as mentioned hereinabove.
6.
 Learned counsel for the appellant contended that the complainant Syed Shah Hussain was not an eye-witness of the incident; that PW-1 Shafiqa Bibi was also not an eye-witness of the incident and she had received information from her son Amjad, but he had not been produced; that statement of PW-1 Shafiqa Bibi was taken during investigation on an affidavit dated 24th April 2002, that too after three months of the incident and she could not justify her presence at the place of incident; that the whole case of the prosecution was based upon the statement of injured Amjad recorded in the first round of trial in absence of the appellant on 10th December 2002, regarding which, the conviction of the appellant was set aside being tried in absentia, therefore, the statement of Amjad cannot be used against the appellant for the reason that his death had been disputed by the defence; that the prosecution has failed to establish the death of PW-5 Amjad and in absence of any death certificate of PW-5 Amjad, his statement cannot be used against the appellant; that according to law, the previous statement can only be used, if fair and full opportunity of cross-examination had been provided to the accused, but in this case, no opportunity of cross-examination was provided to the appellant in the previous round, even otherwise punishment awarded to the appellant in absentia was set aside and the said previous trial was held contrary to section 10-a of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973; that while announcing the judgment in absentia, the Hon'ble High Court had declared the proceedings illegal and unconstitutional, as such any statement recorded during illegal proceedings cannot be used against the appellant; that capital punishment has been awarded to the appellant merely on the basis of previous statement of the injured, but the same had not been put to him at the time of his statement recorded under section 342, Cr.P.C; that the trial Court without examining the Nazim, who allegedly issued the death certificate of PW Amjad, no opportunity of cross-examination was provided to the defence, has passed the impugned judgment, which is contrary to law; that the appellant contested the death of PW-5 Amjad, therefore, in such circumstances, it was for the prosecution to have independently proved the criteria laid down under Article 47 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 (hereinafter the ""Order, 1984""), but the trial Court conducted the trial in a haphazard manner without providing proper opportunity to the appellant. He, at the end of his arguments, submitted that in alternate, the capital punishment could not be awarded to the appellant on mere previous statement of an injured, regarding which criteria laid down under Article 47 of the Order, 1984 had not been fulfilled. He placed reliance on the judgments reported in AIR 1945 Kolkata 139, PLD 1958 SC (Pak) 290 and AIR 1944 Lahore 206.
On the other hand, learned Deputy Prosecutor General assisted by the learned counsel for the complainant while controverting the contentions of the learned counsel for the appellant contended that the prosecution besides producing eye-witness i.e. PW-1 Shafiqa Bibi mother of deceased, also produced the statement of injured Amjad PW-5, which was recorded on 10th December 2002 in the previous trial and in the said statement, opportunity of cross-examination was also provided to the learned counsel for the appellant; that recording of statements of prosecution witnesses in absentia was mandate of the Act, 1997, therefore, the said statements cannot be regarded against the law; that previous conviction of the appellant, recorded in absentia, though was set aside by this Court, but the said aspect of the matter would not debar the prosecution to rely upon the statement of PW-5 and in this respect, the third Investigating Officer produced his certificate with regard to death of PW Amjad and the said certificate in respect of death of Amjad was put to the appellant while recording his statement under section 342, Cr.P.C; that, though the statement was submitted by the counsel for the complainant through an application and the said application was accepted by the trial Court vide order dated 5th June 2009 and the said order was not assailed by the appellant further, which had attained finality; that besides statements of PW-1 and PW Amjad, which could be treated under Article 47 of the Order 1984 coupled with recovery of crime empty, recovery of vehicle and medical certificate, are sufficient to prove that the appellant has committed murder of Syed Arif Hussain and Asadullah and caused injuries to Amjad; that there was no mitigating circumstance and the normal sentence was justified; that the appellant was also convicted for making murderous assault upon PW-5 Amjad and awarded him sentence for 14 years with fine of Rs. 100,000/-. He placed reliance on the judgments reported in 2007 YLR 1046, 2013 PCr.LJ 282, PLD 2010 SC 642, PLD 2014 Peshawar 189, 2012 PCr.LJ 768 and PLD 1978 SC 102.
7.
 We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record of case. In the instant case, the appellant after the incident went to hiding. thus after completing the codal formalities, the trial Court proceeded the previous trial in absentia after completing the procedure as provided under section 19(10) of the Act, 1997 and as per provision an Advocate was also appointed and in the previous trial, the statement of prosecution witness PW Amjad Ali was recorded as PW-5 and he was cross-examined by the counsel, appointed by the trial Court. In the previous trial, the trial Court after recording statements of prosecution witnesses including PW-5 Amjad, convicted the appellant and awarded him death sentence, which findings were challenged by the appellant after his arrest. This Court set aside the previous judgment being passed in absentia and the case was remanded for de novo trial.
8.
 After remand, the prosecution examined six PWs. The trial Court relied upon the ocular account by PW-1 Shafiqa and statement of PW Amjad Ali under Article 47 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. PW-1 Shafiqa though narrated the incident and implicated the appellant in the commission of offence, but her testimony required reconsideration on the point of delay. The incident had taken place on 27 January 2002. PW-1 stated to be present at the place of incident, but neither at the time of incident she recorded her statement, nor explained the sufficient reasons for such delay. She appeared after about three months of the incident sworn an affidavit Ex.P/1-A, but no plausible explanation for such inordinate delay had been put forth, therefore, her statement is not safe to be relied upon. In Muhammad Khan v. Muhammad Bakhsh 1998 SCMR 570, it was observed that ""credibility of a witness is looked with serious suspicion, if his statement under section 161, Cr.P.C. recorded with delay without offering plausible explanation. In case of Muhammad Asif v. The State, 2017 SCMR 486, the honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan observed as under:
""There is a long line of authorities/precedents of this court and the High Courts that even one or two days unexplained delay in recording the statement of eye-witnesses would be fatal and testimony of such witnesses cannot be safely relied upon.""
 In the instant case, the only ocular evidence i.e. PW Amjad Ali, whose statement had been taken into consideration under Article 47 of Order, 1984 by the trial Court, in the subsequent proceedings (instant trial) for awarding capital punishment, therefore, this aspect of the matter requires reconsideration/reappraisal by this Court.
 Article 47 of the Order, 1984 is reproduced herein below:
""Relevancy of certain evidence for proving, in subsequent proceeding, the truth of facts therein stated.
 Evidence given by a witness in a judicial proceeding, or before any person authorized by law to take it is relevant for the purpose of proving, in a subsequent judicial proceeding, or in a later stage of the same judicial proceeding, the truth of the facts which it states, when the witness is dead or cannot be found, or is incapable of giving evidence, or is kept out of the way by the adverse party, or if his presence cannot be obtained without an amount of delay or expense which, under the circumstances of the case, the Court considers unreasonable;
 Provided that;
 the proceeding was between the same parties or their representatives-in-interest;
the adverse party in the first proceeding had the right and opportunity to cross-examine;
the question in issue were substantially the same in the first as in the second proceeding.""
 Article 47 of the Order, 1984 deals relevancy of certain evidence for proving, in subsequent proceeding, the truth of facts therein. Evidence given by a witness in a judicial proceeding, or before any person authorized by law to take it is relevant for the purpose of proving, in a subsequent judicial proceeding, or in a later stage of the same judicial proceeding, the truth of the facts which it states, when the witness is dead or cannot be found, or is incapable of giving evidence, or is kept out of the way by the adverse party, or if his presence cannot be obtained without an amount of delay or expense which, under the circumstances of the case, the Court considers unreasonable. The provision of the Order ibid further states that ""provided that the proceeding was between the same party or their representatives-in-interest; that the adverse party in the first proceeding had the right and opportunity to cross-examine. The provision of Article 47 of the Order, 1984 further lays down the condition under which secondary evidence of the testimony of a witness given in former proceeding civil or criminal is rendered admissible in subsequent proceeding, or in a later stage of the same proceeding. It is based on the rule that the best evidence available must always be produced, therefore, previous deposition of the witness and thereafter admissible in subsequent proceeding subject to the requirement/condition of the Order, 1984 
 The statement of Amjad Ali PW-5 (recorded in the previous trial) was transferred in this case under Article 47 of the Order, 1984, due to death of the said witness. The learned counsel for the appellant criticized the statement on the ground that death of PW Amjad Ali was not proved and secondly that previous trial/proceeding, wherein the statement of PW-5 was recorded, was set aside by this Court being nullity in the eyes of law, therefore, previous trial was neither judicial proceeding nor the appellant had been provided opportunity of cross-examination. He placed reliance on the judgments reported in AIR 1944 Lahore 206 and AIR 1945 Calcutta 137. The case laws referred to and relied upon by the learned counsel are distinguished, as in the first case, the witness given up by the prosecution due to illness of that witness, was transferred on record by the Sessions Judge on the request of defence counsel and held that ""there are two criticism to be made on this procedure. In the first place, the learned Sessions Judge should not have admitted in evidence on the sessions record by transferring the statement of Hassan Khan whether at the request of the public prosecutor or of the defence counsel without proof that Hassan Khan was in fact ill and that his presence could not be obtained without necessary inconvenience, expense and delay as laid down in Section 33, Evidence Act"".
 In the second case, it was observed that ""further Section 33, (Section to Article 47) Evidence Act sanctioned the admission of the evidence of an absent witness only on certain specified grounds, which includes inquiry and evidence to establish the inability of the witness of his appearance"".
09.
 In the instant case, the appellant was arrested from Iran, brought to Quetta on 19.02.2007 and thereafter challan to his extent Ex.P/5-B dated 18th November 2008 was submitted after conducting investigation by PW-6 Maqsood Ahmed Inspector (IP) maintain that during, investigation, he came to know that PW Amjad Ali son of Nadir Ali had been died on 24th March 2008 and his death was certified by the Nazim of the area (Ahmed Ali) through B.P/6-A. It appears that challan to the extent of appellant Ex.P/6-B was submitted after conducting investigation by PW-6. This witness was cross-examined to that effect and he replied as under:
10.
 From the above, it appears that certificate Ex.P/6-A, with regard to the death of PW Amjad Ali had not been challenged by the defence nor rebutted through any cogent evidence, therefore, when application for transfer of statement of PW Amjad Ali was allowed by the trial Court on 05th June, 2009, the above evidence regarding death of Amjad Ali was already on record, thus the requirement of Article 47 of the Order, 1984 was proved with regard to death of prosecution witness and the said evidence was also put to the appellant under section 342, Cr.P.C. Whereas the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that previous conviction awarded to the appellant was recorded by the trial Court in his absentia, and this Court in appeal set aside the same, therefore, as per Article 47 of the Order, 1984, the previous trial was not judicial proceeding, is also not tenable. Since section 19(10) of the Act, 1997 empowers the Anti-Terrorism Court to record statement of a person in the absence of the accused, if it is proved, that an accused has absconded and there is no immediate prospect of arresting him, the Court may record deposition of prosecution witness after appointing an Advocate as provided under section 19(11) of the Act, 1997. The statement of PW Amjad Ali was recorded in the previous trial in a judicial proceeding and counsel for pauper accused also cross-examined the said witness, therefore, statement of PW Amjad Ali qualifying the stander embodied in Article 47 of the Order, 1984. In the case of Arbab Tasleem v. The State PLD 2010 SC 642 the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan observed as under:
""As a general rule of evidence only such statement is legal and admissible which is given during the course of judicial proceedings and is on oath and is taken by a person authorized under the law to take down the evidence and that it is made in the presence of the adverse party, giving the right to the adverse party to cross-examine the statement of such deponent.""
11.
 The provisions of Act, 1997 read with Article 47 of the Order, 1984 are an exception and testimony of a witness becomes a legal piece of evidence, therefore, much care and caution be exercised by the Court before placing reliance on it, particularly in case of capital charge. In the instant case, PW Amjad Ali in his testimony recorded on 10th December 2002 before the trial Court stated that on the fateful day, he along with deceased Arif Hussain and Asadullah were in the vehicle of deceased Arif Hussain and when going towards bazar, the appellant along with his co-accused in a Pajero for second time overtook them and stopped in front of them. The appellant and his co-accused got down and while coming towards them started firing upon them. As a result of their firing, he, Asadullah and Arif (deceased) sustained injuries. They were taken to hospital, where he was informed that his cousin Asadullah and friend Arif have succumbed to the injuries. The statement of PW Amjad had further been supported by PW-3 Dr. Muhammad Anwar, who produced death certificate of Muhammad Arif Ex.P/3-A and death certificate of deceased Asadullah Ex.P/3-B, which indicates fire-arm injuries. PW-4 Khaliq Dad further corroborated the testimony of PW Amjad and stated that after receiving information about the incident, he along with SHO and other officials reached at the place of incident. The dead body of Syed Arif and injured Amjad and Asadullah (who later on succumbed to the injuries) were found in a Yellow Taxi bearing registration No.PT-0092. Besides recovery of vehicle, empties, bloodstained pieces of seat cover, the Pajero vehicle bearing registration No. BC-3535 was also taken into possession vide recovery memo. Ex.P/4-H. The inured witness of prosecution i.e. PW Amjad had given a detail account of the incident by attributing role of firing to the appellant and co-accused in respect of fire-arm injuries sustained by him and deceased Syed Arif and Asadullah. Evidence of witnesses were duly supported by medical evidence, recovery of empties, blood-stained clothes of deceased and injured, The injured witness PW Amjad Ali) was worthy of credence, independent natural and trustworthy and there was no lawful reason to discard his testimony, therefore, the testimony of single witness is found entirely reliable. Reference in this respect is placed to the case of Muhammad Mansha v. The State 2001 SCMR 199, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as under:
""A bare perusal would reveal that the language as employed in the said Article 17(1)(b) is free from any ambiguity and no scholarly interpretation is required. The provisions as reproduced hereinabove of the said Article would make it abundant clear that particular number of witnesses shall not be required for the proof of any fact meaning thereby that a fact can be proved only by a single witness ""it is not seldom that a crime has been committed in the presence of only one witness, leaving aside those cases which are not of uncommon occurrence, where determination of guilt depends entirely on circumstantial evidence. If the Legislature were to insist upon plurality witnesses, case where the testimony of a single witness only could be available in proof of the crime, would go unpunished. It is here that the discretion of the Presiding Judge comes into play. The matter thus must depend upon the circumstances of each case and the quality of the evidence of the single witness whose testimony has to be either accepted or rejected. If such a testimony is found by the Court to be entirely reliable, there is no legal impediment to the conviction of the accused person on such proof. Even as the guilt of an accused person may be proved by the testimony of a single witness, the innocence of an accused person may be established on the testimony of a single witness, even though considerable number of witnesses may be forth coming to testify to the truth of the case for the prosecution. The Court is concerned with the quality and not with the quantity of the evidence necessary for proving or disproving a facts. ""
12.
 Whereas the question of quantum of sentence is concerned, the complainant in the FIR has alleged the motive of the incident as a business dispute and threat of dire consequence on the part of accused persons, but PW Amjad Ali during cross-examination admitted that the appellant had no enmity with him or deceased persons. The prosecution has set up a motive, but failed to prove the same. There is no cavil to the proposition that a motive is not a condition precedent to warrant a finding of guilt, however, it has been found by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan to be relevant while considering the question of sentence. In Iftikhar Mehmood v. Qaiser Iftikhar 2011 SCMR 1165, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan did not interfere with the judgment of High Court on the question of sentence and observed as under:
""We agree with the proposition that motive is not sine qua non for the proof of commission of the crime and at the time the motive is not known to any other person other than deceased or accused which never surfaced on record. However, it cannot be denied that motive is always very relevant to determine the quantum of sentence.""
 In Muhammad Yaseen v. The State 2011 SCMR 905, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan partly allowed the appeal and converted the sentence of death into life imprisonment inter alia on the ground that prosecution has failed to prove motive and observed as under:
""The occurrence took place in a broad-daylight on a thoroughfare when Pervaiz lqbal was on his way back to his house after purchasing ice, therefore, the story of substitution propounded by learned counsel for the appellant cannot be accepted. In the absence of any corroboration, the Courts are expected to follow the rule of abundant care and caution in the matter of sentence. It is not denied that no resident of the lane in which the occurrence took place appeared and supported the prosecution story. The prosecution has failed to prove the motive for the offence. The appellant allegedly fired only one shot and decamped from the place of occurrence. The P.Ws. were at a considerable distance from the place where Pervaiz Iqbal was done to death. Therefore, in the above circumstances, we consider it just and proper to convert the sentence of death into imprisonment for life.""
 In view of the above, while maintaining the conviction of the appellant, we partly allow Criminal (A.T.A.) Appeal No. 187 of 2009 and convert the sentence of death into life imprisonment. However, the remaining sentences with regard to the compensation and in default thereof shall remain intact. Benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C. already extended by the trial Court shall remain intact. Consequently, the Murder Reference No. 16 of 2009 is answered in

 JAWAD HASSAN, J.---
 Through the instant Intra Court Appeal the Appellant has challenged the validity of impugned order dated 17.05.2017 passed in Writ Petition No.4634/2016 by the learned Single Judge whereby he dismissed the petition filed by the Appellant.
2.
 Brief facts tersely revealed from this Appeal are that the Appellant filed W.P. No.4634/2016 and made multiple prays to the effect that a writ of certiorari may be issued by declaring that Notification SRO No.1687FT(F&A) dated April, 1956 is ineffective and has expired since 1986 and the lien of the suspension over the land of the Appellant is no more operative and the Respondents may be directed to remove the name of the forest department from the revenue record and further the Respondents may be directed not to interfere in the peaceful ownership and possession of the Appellant over the land, which was dismissed by the learned Single Judge vide the impugned order. Hence, the instant Appeal.
3.
 Learned counsel for the Appellant submitted that the impugned order is liable to be set aside on the grounds that the same is against law and facts; that the learned Single Judge has erred while passing the impugned order that factual controversy is involved in the matter rather the Appellant had raised question of law by submitting that the above referred notification/SRO is ineffective upon the ownership of the Appellant.
4.
 We have heard the arguments of the learned counsel for the Appellant and examined the record available with this Appeal.
5.
 The examination of the impugned order depicts that the same has been passed on the basis of following three grounds:
i.
 Prior to establishing the afore-noted questions no effective relief can be granted to the Petitioner, as the jurisdiction of this Court is meant to enforce the clear legal rights, but not to establish the same from him.
ii.
 The prayers quoted as well as contention raised by the learned counsel for the Petitioner brings the case within the realm of disputed/factual questions, resolution of which require a thorough inquiry, which this Court in exercise of its constitutional jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution cannot undertake.
iii.
 The Petitioner has alternate efficacious remedy available to him by approaching the Civil Court, therefore, jurisdiction of this Court is, even otherwise barred.
6.
 The jurisdiction of this Court has been defined in Article 199 of the Constitution. As per Article 199(1)(c) and (2) of the Constitution, it has been stated that on the application of any aggrieved person, make an order giving such directions to any person or authority, including any Government exercising any power or performing any function in, or in relation to, any territory within the jurisdiction of that Court as may be appropriate for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights conferred by Chapter 1 of Part II.
(2)
 Subject to the Constitution, the right to move a High Court for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights conferred by Chapter 1 of Part II shall not be abridged.
Reliance in this regard is placed on the case titled Asdullah Manzi and others v. Pakistan International Airlines Corporation and others (2005 SCMR 445) wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan held as under:
""The right which is the foundation of an application under Article 199 of the Constitution is a personal and individual right. The legal right may be a statutory right or a right recognized by the law. A person can be said to be aggrieved only when a person is denied a legal right by someone who has a legal duty to perform relating to the right. There must not only be a right but a justifiable right in existence, to give jurisdiction to the High Court in the matter. Unless whatever right, no order can be issued under Art.199.""
It has been further held in the judgment supra that Object of proceedings initiated under Article 199 of the Constitution is the enforcement of a right and not the establishment of legal right and therefore, the right of the incumbent concerned which he seeks to enforce, must not only be clear and complete but simplicitor and there must be an actual infringement of the right.
7.
 Furthermore, the multiple prayers made by the Appellant in the petition, itself shows that certain disputed question of facts are involved in the matter which, under the jurisdiction of this Court, cannot be resolved and the Appellant may adopt appropriate forum/alternate remedy for the determination of the same, as such the learned Single Judge has rightly dismissed the petition of the Appellant on the above referred three grounds and all these grounds have been strengthen by relying upon the judgments of the apex Court. Learned counsel for the Appellant has failed to show any illegality or perversity in the impugned order which has been passed in consonance with the spirit of law and judgment of the apex Court.
8.
 We fully agree with the finding of the learned Single Judge who while relying upon the judgments of the apex Court dismissed the petition being not maintainable. In view of above circumstances, we see no illegality or jurisdictional error in the impugned order which has been passed in line with the dictates of law and does not warrant any interference by this Division Bench.
9.
 Resultantly, the instant Appeal, being bereft of any force, is accordingly dismissed in limine.

 YOUSUF ALI SAYEED, J.---
The instant First Rent Appeal under S.24 of the Cantonments Rent Restriction Act, 1963 (the ""Act"") pertains to the left front portion of Plot No. D-128 Depot Lines, Saghir Hussain Shaheed Road, Karachi, (the ""Subject Premises""), and calls into question the propriety of the Order dated 25.10.2016 (the ""Impugned Order"") made by the learned Additional Controller of Rent, Karachi Cantonment, in Rent Case Number 10 of 2014 (the ""Rent Case""), whereby the defence of the Appellants was struck-off and they were directed to vacate the Subject Premises and hand over peaceful possession thereof to the Respondent within 40 days.
2.
 Briefly, the salient facts leading up to and culminating in the Impugned Order, are as follows:--
(a)
 The Appellants entered into a Tenancy Agreement with the Respondent on 16.11.2012, whereby the Subject Premises, as delineated therein, was taken by them on rent from the Respondent on a monthly rent of Rs.300,000/-.
(b)
 In respect of their obligation to pay rent under the Tenancy Agreement, the Appellants issued 24 postdated cheques to the Respondent, covering the period January 2013 to December 2014.
(c)
 The Respondent instituted the Rent Case, alleging that the Appellants had violated the Tenancy Agreement by raising illegal construction over the Subject Premises and committed default in payment of rent in respect of the months of February and March 2013 and the period May 2013 and beyond and that the post-dated cheques issued in that regard had been dishonoured on presentment.
(d)
 An Application under S.17(8) of the Act was filed by the Respondent seeking a direction as against the Appellants as to payment of the aforementioned arrears of rent as well as payment of future rent. 
(e)
 On 23.12.2014, the learned Rent Controller was pleased to make a tentative rent Order in respect of the Respondent's Application, whereby the Appellants were directed to deposit the arrears of rent amounting to Rs.6,900,000/- on or before 31.12.2014 and to deposit future monthly rent at the rate of Rs.300,000/- before the 5th day of each month.
(f)
 The Appellants failed to comply with the tentative rent Order, and no amount whatsoever was deposited, whether in respect of the arrears or the future period, prompting the filing of an Application under S.17(9) of the Act, and after affording ample opportunity of hearing to the Appellants, the Rent Case eventually came to be disposed of in terms of the Impugned Order, on the terms aforementioned.
3.
 With reference to the Written Statement and the Counter-Affidavit to the Application under S.17(8) filed in the Rent Case, learned counsel for the Appellants contended that Impugned Order was bad in law as the learned Rent Controller had failed to taken into account that there was a dispute pending inter se the Appellants and the Respondent in relation to the Subject Premises in as much as the Appellants had been induced to enter into the Tenancy Agreement on the basis of a representation that the Subject Premises could be put to commercial use, whereas it subsequently transpired that the same was residential in nature. He contended that such misrepresentation constituted a fundamental breach of the Tenancy Agreement on the part of the Respondent, and the Appellant was therefore under no obligation to pay rent thereunder. He further submitted that the Respondent had thus issued instruction to the bank to stop payment of the Cheques. Whilst admitting that no payment had been made towards compliance of the tentative rent Order, learned counsel contended that the said Order ought not to have been passed in view of this dispute, which was the subject of Suit Number 1709 of 2014, for declaration, mandatory and permanent injunction, and compensation of Rs.10 crore, pending before this Court. He prayed that the Impugned Order thus be set aside.
4.
 Learned counsel for the Respondent controverted the aforementioned submissions and contended that the course of action followed by the learned Rent Controller was just and proper, keeping in view the admitted default on the part of the Appellants. He submitted that the Appellants had fabricated a dispute in an endeavour to explain away such default and had thus sought to superimpose the same on the proceedings in the Rent Case albeit the same having no nexus with such proceedings. He pointed out that, even otherwise, the Application filed by the Appellants under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. in Suit Number 1709 of 2014 seeking a restraining order against the Respondent from claiming rent had been dismissed by a learned single Judge of this 
Court vide Order dated 09.01.2015, and submitted that the instant proceedings similarly merited dismissal.
5.
 Having considered the arguments advanced at the bar and examined the record, I am of the view that the failure on the part of the Appellants to comply with the tentative rent Order cannot be condoned on the basis of a dispute as alleged by the Appellants. The Appellant, whilst alleging misrepresentation and unfitness of the Subject Premises for its intended purpose, has nonetheless paradoxically remained in possession thereof, whereas, if they were indeed unable to put the Subject Premises to use, they ought to then have forthwith vacated the same. In my opinion, as long as the Appellants remain liable to pay rent in respect of the Subject Premises to the Respondent for such time as they remain in occupation thereof, and the existence of a dispute, as raised by the Appellant in the aforementioned Suit, would be determined on its own merits in that proceeding, but does not serve to absolve the Appellants of their payment obligation in respect of their continued occupation of the Subject Premises, and the default on their part in perpetuation of such a stance is clearly wilful and contumacious.
6.
 As such, I find no irregularity or illegality in the Impugned Order, and no case for interference stands made out. Accordingly, this Appeal is dismissed.

 IJAZ ANWAR, J.---
Through this petition, the petitioner has called in question his repatriation order dated 9.5.2017 and claimed the following prayer:-
 ""It is therefore humbly prayed that this Hon'ble Court may decide as under:-
A. The Chairman, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is entitled to complete three years of his tenure as provided in section 3(b) in KPK Service Tribunal (Amendment Act, 2013 and in view of Articles 4, 5 of the Constitution and decision of Supreme Court reported as PLD 2013 SC 501 whereby the question of law as involved in the case under consideration has been decided requiring obedience in terms of Article 189 and Article 190 in the Constitution of Pakistan.
B. The impugned order of repatriation dated May 9, 2017 issued by provincial government is unlawful being in conflict with section 3(b) of the above mentioned KPK Service Tribunal (Amendment) Act, 2013.
C. The decision of the Administration Committee of Peshawar High Court referred to the letter issued by the Registrar of Peshawar High Court dated 03.06.2017, being a executive, consultative and administrative authority is subject to judicial review, requiring the findings of the Administration Committee to be brought in consonance with the constitutional provisions laid down in Articles 189 and 190 of Constitution of Pakistan to be read with the judgment of Supreme Court reported as PLD 2013 SC 501.
D. Consequently, the impugned notification of repatriation of petitioner issued by provincial government may be declared as unlawful and ineffective against petitioner and the petitioner may therefore be allowed to complete his tenure of three years since his appointment as the Chairman of the Tribunal, in pursuance of the notification of the appointment issued by the Provincial Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as Annexed A.
2.
 The facts as narrated in this petition are that vide Notification No. SO (E.I) E&AD/9-126/2015 dated January 5, 2015, Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Establishment and Administration Department has appointed the petitioner as Chairman, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Service Tribunal for a period of three years or till attaining the age of Sixty years with effect from 05/01/2015. Through the impugned notification dated 9.5.2017, the Provincial Government has with the consultation of the Hon'ble Chief Justice of Peshawar High Court, repatriated the services of the petitioner. The petitioner claimed to have submitted a letter No.1310-1315/ST, dated 12/05/2017 for the withdrawal of the notification in respect of his repatriation, that was followed by a reminder dated 19.5.2017. The petitioner then submitted a Reference to the Administration Committee of this Court against the same repatriation order, which was regretted by the Administration Committee of this Court, the order was conveyed to him vide letter No.10039/Admn, dated 03/06/2017 communicating the following reasons:-
""While considering the representation against repatriation of Mr. Muhammad Azeem Khan Afridi, Chairman, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Service Tribunal to High Court, the Administration Committee held that the repatriation of judicial officers is the prerogative of Hon'ble the Chief Justice which he has exercised in the case of Mr. Muhammad Azeem Khan Afridi. The Committee endorsed the same and directed that he should report immediately to High Court"".
3.
 The learned counsel for the petitioner was heard in motion. He contended that the appointment of the petitioner as Chairman, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Service Tribunal is a tenure posting and governed under section 3 (b) of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Service Tribunal Act, 1974, where under the petitioner has to complete a period of three years and before completion of the tenure period; the order of repatriation is legally not tenable. The learned counsel for the petitioner argued that by virtue of the reported judgments of the Apex Court PLD 2013 SC 501, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Service Tribunal was given independent status to uphold the separation of judiciary from the executive, thus the laws relating to the establishment of Services Tribunal was amended pursuant to the above judgment of the Apex Court. Learned counsel for the petitioner has also questioned the decision of the Administration Committee of this Court whereby the reason of repatriation has not been disclosed but considered it to be the prerogative of the Hon'ble Chief Justice. He argued that where the law provides posting/appointment for a specific tenure period, the Hon'ble Chief Justice was left with no prerogative. The learned counsel for the petitioner further argued that in view of the latest pronouncement of the Apex Court reported in PLD 2016 SC 961, every such administrative order of the High Court that violate any of the provision of law is questionable before this Court in constitutional jurisdiction.
4.
 To appreciate and consider the arguments of the learned counsel for the petitioner, we may refer to the amended provision of Service Tribunal Act, 1974, whereby appointments of the Chairman are made in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Service Tribunal. This amendment was inserted vide Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Act No.X of 2013. Section 3 is reproduced for convenience:-
3.Tribunal
:--(1) The Governor may, by notification in the official gazette, establish one or more Service Tribunals and, where there are established more than one Tribunal, the Governor shall specify in the notification the class or classes of civil servants in respect of whom or the territorial limits within which, each such Tribunal shall exercise jurisdiction under this Act.
 (2)----
 (3)- A Tribunal shall consist of---
(a)- a Chairman, being a person who [is], has been, or is qualified to be, Judge of High Court; and
(b)- four members, two of whom shall be from amongst District and Sessions Judges and two from amongst the civil servants in BPS-20 and above]
(4)-The Chairman and members of a Tribunal shall be appointed by the Governor in consultation with the Chief Justice of the Peshawar High Court.]
 (5)---
 (6)---
 3A.----
Section 3-B is also reproduced, which relates to tenure and other terms and conditions.
3-B. Tenure, terms and conditions of service of Chairman and members
.---(1) 
The Chairman and a member shall hold office for a period of three years or until he attains the age of sixty years, whichever is earlier, and shall not be eligible for reappointment:
Provided that if a judge of the High Court is appointed as Chairman, he shall hold office for a period of three years or until he attains the age of superannuation as judge of the High Court whichever is earlier.
(2)-In case, a retired judge of the High Court is appointed as Chairman under clause (a) of subsection (3) of section 3, he shall hold office for a period of three years and shall not be eligible for re-appointment.
(3)-The other terms and conditions of service of the Chairman and members shall be such as may be determined by the Governor.
5.
 Admittedly, the petitioner is an officer of the status of District and Sessions Judge (BS-21) and has his seniority amongst other Judicial Officers of the Subordinate Judiciary. It is pertinent to mention here that in the appointment of the Members and Chairman of the Tribunal, the Chief Justice Peshawar High Court has been given the meaningful consultative powers because undue the unamended subsection (4) of section 3 of the Service Tribunal Act, 1974 no such authority was expressly given. The unamended provision was:-
""The Chairman and Members of a Tribunal shall be appointed by the Governor on such terms and conditions as he may determine"".
6.
 It is a matter of record that every appointment on these Ex-cadre posts are considered to be on deputation, because for every such posting, period is required to be specified. Similar is the case of Chairman of the Service Tribunal, who is in fact nominated by the Hon'ble Chief Justice for his appointment for specific period of three years or until he attains the age of Sixty years whichever is earlier. Moreover, the officer while posted under the Provincial Government remained under the administrative powers of the Hon'ble Chief Justice, because for his work and conduct, he remained answerable to the High Court. Though, it has not been specified in the amended section 3B of the Service Tribunal Act, 1974, how to repatriate or cut short the tenure of the Chairman of the Service Tribunal. But the fact remains that the authority, to appoint and to hold the post of Chairman Service Tribunal remains with the Hon'ble Chief Justice, suppose the officer is to be proceeded departmentally for any of his misconduct; the High Court would still wait for the completion of his tenure or to allow him to retire on superannuation. Section 21 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 will come into play, where an authority has the power to appoint an individual he has the power to remove also.
7.
 Apart from this fact, all these Ex-cadre posts are considered as on deputation to the Provincial Government, the main scheme of the concept of deputation is that it is at the consent of lending and borrowing departments and the incumbent of the post have no right, whatsoever, to ask for completion of the tenure or have any right to remain as such. At any time, the lending department can require the services of its officer by repatriating him and similar is the case with borrowing department; they can relieve or spare him as no longer required. 
8.
 The Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has in a number of judgments considered the posting of officers on deputation. In an identical case reported in 2011 SCMR 1688, the Apex Court dismissed the petition filed under Article 184 (3) by a Special Judge whose services were repatriated and who claimed that his tenure posting as Special Judge for three years could not be curtailed by Hon'ble Chief Justice Lahore High Court. The Apex Court refused to interfere in the repatriation of the Special Judge and held as:-
""On the touchstone of the criterion as mentioned herein above, we have examined the question as to whether in this case the provisions as enumerated in Article 184 (3) of the Constitution can be invoked?. The answer would be in negative for the simple reason that for all practical purposes the petitioner is under the administrative control of Lahore High Court Lahore and besides that now he has got no lien against the post of Special Judge Central, Rawalpindi being deputationist and his services have already been repatriated. By no stretch of imagination the learned Lahore High Court Lahore can be directed to refrain from initiation of any disciplinary action as this aspect of the matter exclusively falls within its domain of jurisdiction"".
9.
 In order to appreciate the amended provision of section 3B, it will be necessary to go into the background of the amendment. What we gathered from the relevant paras of the reported judgment PLD 2013 SC 501. The intension of specifying 3 years was because of the fact that previously contract appointments of the Retd. Judges were extended repeatedly from time to time. Thus the Hon'ble Supreme Court restricted that tenure to only 03 years and that too was subjected to the consultation of the respective Chief justice of the Province.
10.
 Mere posting under section 3B of a Chairman for 03-years cannot be considered sacrosanct, and that is subject to modification/curtailment at the exigencies of service.
11.
 The consistent view of the Superior Court on the tenure of the deputationist are that deputationist did not have any vested right to remain on the post for ever or for a stipulated period. The deputationist could be ordered to be repatriated to the parent department at any time without assigning any reason. Similarly, the parent department is not obliged under the law, to assign any reasons for his repatriation. Thus, the Hon'ble Administrative Committee of this Court has rightly regretted the reference of the petition, by holding the repatriation as prerogative of the Hon'ble Chief Justice.
12.
 In expressing the above view, we are fortified by the judgments of the Apex Court reported in 2014 SCMR 799, 822, 2011 SCMR 1688, 2010 SCMR 378 = 618. 
13.
 For the above stated reasons, this petition being misconceived and have no merit, is 
dismissed
 accordingly.

19,CHINA INTERNATIONAL WATER AND ELECTRIC CORPORATION Versus PAKISTAN WATER AND POWER DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY (WAPDA),"June 12, 2017",KARACHI HIGH COURT SINDH, Honorable Justice Muhammad Junaid Ghaffar ,2018 CLC 188,"JUDGMENT
 MUHAMMAD JUNAID GHAFFAR, J.---
 This is a Suit in respect of an Award passed by the learned Sole Arbitrator dated 23.07.1999 and through this Judgment the objections raised on behalf of Defendant under Sections 30 and 33 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 against the validity of the said Award are being decided.
2.
 Precisely, the facts as stated appear to be that a Tender was floated by Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (Defendant) for the construction of Rato Dero Pump Station (Project), wherein, the bid of China International Water and Electric Corporation (Plaintiff) was accepted. The contract price was Rs.108,668,800/- and the period of contract was 15 months from 28.06.1996 to 28.09.1997. After the Award of the Contract, some dispute arose between the Plaintiff and Defendant and for the present purposes it is only the dispute regarding running Bill No.5 dated 31.01.1997, and therefore, the facts are confined to that extent only. The said running bill was verified by the Engineer on 08.03.1997 but payment was not made within the required period, therefore, the dispute arose. Thereafter the Plaintiff on 04.07.1997 filed an Application under Section 20 of the Arbitration Act, 1940, which was registered as Suit No.875/1997 and the same was decided vide order dated 21.10.1997 and the matter was referred to the learned Sole Arbitrator. Subsequently the Award was passed against which objections were filed by the Plaintiff as well as the Defendant. The said objections were decided by the learned Single Judge of this Court in this Suit vide Judgment dated 01.06.2005 and though the validity of the Award in favour of the Plaintiff was accepted but it was held that the Award was passed on an invalid Reference dated 21.10.1997, therefore, the Arbitrator had no jurisdiction to decide the dispute and pass the Award. The said order was challenged by the Plaintiff through High Court Appeal No.173/2005 and vide Order dated 26.03.2009, the Judgment of the learned Single judge was set-side and the matter was remanded for decision afresh after taking into consideration the objections raised by the Defendant in its Application under Section 30 of the Arbitration Act, 1940. The Defendant being aggrieved preferred a Civil Appeal No.133-K/2009 before the Honourable Supreme Court, which was dismissed vide Order dated 03.09.2012 and the order of Appellate Court was upheld. Under these circumstances, the matter is now before this Court for deciding the objections of the Defendant against the said Award only.
3.
 The learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the Defendant has contended that the Interim Payment Certificate (""IPC"") regarding running Bill No.5 was certified by the Consultant on 08.03.1997 and was delivered on the same date, whereas, the payment was required to be made within 45 days as provided in Conditions of Contract (""COC"") Part-II, Clause 60(5)(a). He has further submitted that such period stood extended for further 60 days in terms of Clause-69(1)(d) of the COC and the consequence thereof is that if the payment is not made within 45+60 days then the Plaintiff was entitled to terminate the contract; but only after giving 14 days prior notice, which per learned Counsel was never issued and considered. He has further contended that for calculation of the period of 45 days and thereafter 60 days, the date of the IPC is to be excluded, however, the learned Sole Arbitrator has not taken into consideration such factual position. According to the Defendant, 45 days expired on 22.04.1997 and thereafter the 60 days' period was to end on 21.06.1997 and 21.06.1997 was a declared local holiday in view of Urs of Hazrat Shah Abdul Lateef Bhitai being 14th Safar and the next date, which is 22.06.1997, was Sunday. Whereas, the cheque dispatched on 20.06.1997 was received by the Plaintiff on 23.06.1997, which was encashed on 24.06.1997, therefore, there was no default on the part of the Defendant. He has further contended that without prejudice to this, the Plaintiff never complied with the terms of COC by issuing a proper legal notice for the alleged termination of the Contract and giving a 14 days' time to the Defendant, and therefore, all such acts done by the Plaintiff including stoppage of work etc. was in violation of the Contract for which the Plaintiff is not entitled for any of the relief(s) so granted in the Award. According to the learned Counsel even if the matter was referred for Arbitration as per the Contract, the work should not have been stopped; rather should have been continued, however the Plaintiff had no intention to carry out the second part of the Contract, which apparently was of less profit percentage, and therefore, they made out this unjustified reason for the alleged termination. Learned Counsel has further contended that the learned Arbitrator has not appreciated the material placed before him including the WAPDA Manual, which provides for the terms of payment and its procedure, whereas, the established practice, whereby, the Plaintiff used to collect their cheques on the due date, has not been considered and rather ignored without any plausible justification. Per learned Counsel it is a settled proposition that while calculating the limitation period first day is to be excluded and for that learned Counsel has also referred to Section 9 of the General Clauses Act, 1897. Learned Counsel has also raised an objection that various payments including damages have been awarded to the Plaintiff by the learned Sole Arbitrator, however, there is no certification to all these payments as required under the Contract, and therefore, non-certification by the Engineer, is in violation of Clause 65(8) of the COC, hence invalid. Per learned Counsel learned Sole Arbitrator while granting various payments, including damages has also failed to consider the material facts as well as the evidence on record and has in fact passed his Award on presumption, which is impermissible in law. In the circumstances, learned Counsel has prayed to set-aside the Award in favour of the Defendant. In support of his contention he has relied upon the cases reported as PLD 1959 Daaca 551 (Dhirendra Nath Datta Roy and others v. Sundhindra Chandra Chakraborti), 2002 CLD 1071 (Shaukat Ali Mian v. Trust Leasing Corporation Ltd. through Chief Executive and 4 others), AIR 1952 Travancore-Cochin 181 (Krishnan Neelakandhan v.

4.
 On the other, learned Counsel for the Plaintiff at the very outset has raised an objection to the effect that this Court is not sitting in Appeal against the Award and is not required to fish latent errors. Per learned Counsel it is only the misconduct of the learned Sole Arbitrator, which can be looked into but even if a different conclusion is to be arrived at, even then, the reasoning of the learned Sole Arbitrator cannot be interfered with. Learned Counsel has contended that in the first round vide Judgment dated 01.06.2005 all the points on merits were upheld in favour of the Plaintiff and there can be no exception to such finding. He has further contended that the first day could not have been excluded as it remained practice between the parties to include the first day while calculating the limitation, and therefore, the last date according to the Plaintiff was 20.06.1997. Whereas, 21.06.1997 was not a Federal Government holiday, therefore, no benefit can be taken by the Defendant, being a Federal Government Entity. Learned Counsel has further contended that since the cheque was not received by 20.06.1997, therefore, in terms of Clause 69(1)(d) of the COC, the Plaintiff was within its rights to terminate the Contract and for such purposes the intimation given to the Defendant was a valid Legal Notice as the same also stands approved by the findings of the learned Sole Arbitrator. Per learned Counsel the Award of the learned Sole Arbitrator has given all the reasoning, and therefore, it is unexceptionable and must not be interfered with. In support of his contention he has relied upon the cases reported as PLD 2011 Supreme Court 506 (Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Food, Islamabad and others v. Messrs Joint Venture Kocks K.G./Rist), PLD 2006 Supreme Court 169 (Mian Corporation through Managing Partner v. Messrs Lever Brothers of Pakistan Ltd. through General Sales Manager, Karachi), PLD 1996 Supreme Court 108 (M/s. Joint Venture KG/Rist through D.P. Giesler G.M.

5.
 I have heard both the learned Counsel and perused the record. First I would like to deal with the objection raised by the learned Counsel for the Plaintiff that this Court cannot set-aside an Award on the ground that a different conclusion can be drawn. To this, I am of the view that there is no cavil and it is settled law that while hearing objections to the Award under Sections 30 and 33 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 this Court does not sit as a Court of appeal nor it is required to undertake reappraisal of evidence recorded by the Arbitrator in order to discover the error or infirmity in the award. However, there is an exception to this rule as well. If the error or infirmity in the award rendering it invalid is appearing on the face of the award and is discoverable by reading the award itself, then the same can be looked into for either setting aside or modifying it. It can also be interfered with in certain exceptional circumstances when the finding of the Arbitrator is not based on the evidence on record Reference may be made to the case reported as Joint Venture KG/Rist v. Federation of Pakistan-PLD 1996 SC 108, Ghee Corporation of Pakistan (Pvt.) Limited v. Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (PLD 1999 Karachi 112) and J.F.C. Gollaher v. Samad Khan (1993 MLD 726).
6.
 In the case of Allah Din & Company v. Trading Corporation of Pakistan (2006 SCMR 614) the Hon'ble Supreme Court has been pleased to observe as under;
.... The learned Division Bench in the impugned judgment had aptly rejected the above claim on the ground that compensation for loss of goodwill or reputation is generally not awarded, particularly in the absence of tangible evidence showing additional loss and further that since the purchaser was already awarded Rs.1 million by the arbitrator as compensation for the anticipated loss of profit further compensation on account of loss of goodwill and reputation was not justified. We find ourselves in agreement with the reasoning of the learned Division Bench. The learned counsel appearing for the purchaser was unable to show any discussion by the arbitrator in the award regarding the loss suffered by the purchaser on account of reputation or goodwill. Apart from a bare claim of the purchaser, the learned counsel could not even refer to any evidence produced by the purchaser before the arbitrator on this issue. The finding of the arbitrator on the issue reproduced above indicates the absence of such evidence as he had awarded compensation on the item simply on the ground that the purchaser was not questioned on behalf of the Food Department on the issue. Such failure by the department does not go to prove the loss caused to the purchaser. It was the burden to the purchaser to have produced independent evidence of the damage caused to his reputation and goodwill on account of non-performance of the contract by the Food Department. Bald statement of the petitioner, without more, that he had suffered loss on this account was not sufficient to establish the claim. In this view of the matter the purchaser was rightly denied damages for loss of goodwill and reputation.
6. 
 The contention of the learned counsel for the purchaser that the Court is not entitled to disagree with the findings of the arbitrator is without force. It is true that the trial Court does not sit in appeal from the finding of the arbitrator but at the same time the Court is empowered to reverse the finding of the arbitrator on any issue if it does not find support from the evidence. The very incorporation of section 26-A of the Arbitration Act requiring the arbitrator to furnish reasons for his finding was to enable the Court to examine the soundness of the reasons. As already held the arbitrator in the case before us had granted damages for loss of reputation and goodwill without there being any evidence to that effect. The Court were, therefore, justified in denying this claim to the purchaser.
7.
 Similarly in the case of IBAD & Co v. Government of Pakistan (PLD 1981 Karachi 236) a learned Single Judge of this Court has been pleased to hold as under;
9.
 The third challenge of learned counsel for the defendant was that it was a case of no evidence. As observed earlier, the contention was that admittedly this was a case of damages but no evidence was adduced by the plaintiffs for proving any damage suffered by them. Counsel, in the circumstances, urged that the record be perused by the Court to determine whether there was evidence before the arbitrator that the plaintiff had suffered the damages which had been awarded by the Arbitrator. To the extent that where there is an allegation that the award is based on no evidence, the Court can, even in a case of non-speaking award, peruse the record including the evidence while considering the objections/application under sections 30 and 33 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 the contention of learned counsel is correct. And if the Court on such perusal finds the award is based on no evidence, will be lawfully exercising jurisdiction in setting aside the award . However, it is also settled law that insufficiency of evidence or that on the evidence adduced before the arbitration the Court would have reached a different conclusion is not a ground for setting aside or interfering with the award. Keeping these principles of mind, I have perused the record of the arbitration proceedings in this case.
8.
 Even otherwise, in this matter the crux of the dispute is regarding interpretation of contract document and the period of limitation as to whether the cheque was issued within time and further that whether issuance of a cheque would amount to making of payment within the period of limitation or not. It further requires to be interpreted that whether the cheque, which was issued within the period of limitation but was encashed thereafter, would amount to discharge of liability within time or not. This is a pure legal question, which has been decided by learned Sole Arbitrator and merely for the fact and reasoning so advanced on behalf of the Plaintiff that ordinarily the Court must not interfere in the Award, which is given on the basis of appraisal of evidence, I am not inclined to agree with it as in my view this case is an exception inasmuch as it is to be looked into that whether inference drawn by the learned Sole Arbitrator is legal or otherwise. In fact this is not a case wherein only on appraisal of evidence some finding of fact is given, which ordinarily is not to be disturbed by the Court while hearing objections to the award; but a case wherein primarily a legal view has been taken by the learned Sole Arbitrator for passing of award in favor of the plaintiff. In such view of the matter, this Court needs to appraise the findings of learned Sole Arbitrator in this regard. Reliance in this regard may be placed on the case of Province of Sindh Waseem Construction Co. (1991 CLC 66) wherein a learned Division Bench of this Court has been pleased to hold that when the provisions of a contract document have not been properly appreciated by the Arbitrator, then it is a case of an error apparent on the face of the award, and therefore, can be interfered with.
9.
 Though the facts have already been stated hereinabove; but for recapitulating, the dispute appears to be in respect IPC No.5, which was certified by the Engineer on 08.03.1997. The period of 45 days after excluding 08.03.1997 would have ended on 22.04.1997 and further grace period of 60 days again excluding 22.04.1997 would have ended on 21.06.1997. Whereas, if 08.03.1997 is included then the period of 45 days would have ended on 21.04.1997 and similarly the period of 60 days if 22.04.1997 is included would have ended on 20.06.1997. The learned Sole Arbitrator had framed the following consent Issues available at Page-7:-
(I)
 Whether the statement of claim was filed in these proceedings is covered by the reference made to the Sole Arbitrator and if so to what extent?
(II)
 Whether the statement of claim as filed is maintainable particularly in view of clause 67 of the COC and if so to what extent?
(III)
 Whether the claimants were justified in invoking clause 69 of the COC and if so to what extent and effect?
(IV)
 Whether the claimants notice dated 21st June 1997 terminating the contract R.T.D-1 is contractually valid under the provision of clause 69(1) of COC?
(IV)-(V) Whether the claimants are entitled to the sum of Rs.8,48,79,270/- as damages or any other amount due under the contract?
(V)
 What the Award should be?
10.
 Insofar as Issues Nos. I and II are concerned no further deliberation is required inasmuch on the basis of Order dated 26.3.2009 passed in HCA No.173/2005 in the first round of litigation, it is only the objections of the Defendant, which are to be dealt with and decided; and therefore, both these Issues need not be discussed and decided.
11.
 Insofar as Issues Nos. III and IV are concerned these Issues are crucial Issues and if the answer to these Issues is given in favour of the Defendant then there would be no need to give any finding on Issues Nos.V and VI. As discussed hereinabove, the opinion through this Judgment revolves around above Issues Nos.III and IV and precisely it is to the effect that whether the first day is to be included or not; and secondly whether the Plaintiff was justified in terminating the Contract. Insofar as Issues Nos.III and IV are concerned the relevant finding of the learned Sole Arbitrator is as under:-
""20.
 On the interpretation of clauses 60 and 69 COC, both the parties seem to be of the same view. The only difference is about the method of computation of the period. Clause 60(l)(a) provides that the Engineer can approve or amend the AIP and when the Engineer has determined the amount due to the contractor he shall issue to the employer and the contractor a certificate called Interim Payment Certificate certifying amount due to the contractor therefore on certification the amount becomes due to the contractor. Such interim payment certificates are proof of the amount due as certified by the Engineer. In sub-clause 5(a) payment is to be made within 45 days of such certificate being delivered to the employer. Under clause 69 as amended by Part II if the employer fails to pay the amount due under any certificate of the Engineer within 60 days after the same shall have become due under the terms of the contract the contractor shall be entitled to terminate his employment under the contract after giving 14 days prior notice to the employer.
21.
 The next question is whether the payment through cheque was made within the situated time. Admittedly the payment has been made through cheque dated 20th June, 1997. The Learned Counsel for the claimants has referred to the meaning of the word payment as defined in (I). the Lexicon by P. Ramanath Aiyar 1997 edition as discharge of an obligation by delivery of money or its equivalent and is generally made with the assent of both parties to the contract (2). In Black Law dictionary, it has been defined as ""In a more restricted legal sense, payment is the performance of the duty, promise or obligation or discharge of a debtor liability by the delivery of money."" (3) In Ballantine's Law Dictionary ""payment of cheque has been defined as: 
""The act of the drawee bank in handing over money the amount in which the cheque is drawn, to a payee or endorse .... accepted unconditionally by the payee or endorsee.""
Reference has also been made to Negotiable Instrument Act by Bhashayam and Adiga (1997 Ed) Pagits Law of Banking (10th Ed) and AIR 1994 Cal. 459 (Borojender Coomar Banerji v. Shrish Chandra Chterjee).
Relying on these definitions the Learned Counsel for the claimants has contended that as the cheque deposited in the account of the claimants which was credited on 24th June 1997 this should be treated as the date of payment. The Learned Counsel for the respondents contended that the date when the cheque was issued should be the date of payment. Reliance has been made on M/s. Mahmood Ahmed v. M. A. Marker, PLD 1983 Quetta 36. In this judgment reliance has been placed on Sarfraz Khan's case PLD 1969 Karachi 176 and Peoples Sheet Mills, PLD 1991 Karachi 379. All the referred judgments are under the provisions of West Pakistan Urban Rent Restriction Ordinance. It was observed that cheque received by landlord on dates mentioned on cheque the date of payment of rent shall be deemed to be made on such date (as mentioned on the cheque). In Sarfraz Khan's case it was observed that if the deposit is made in the Controller office by cheque and payment on the cheque is received by the Controller then the tenant cannot be deemed to be in default unless the deposit of cheque itself was made after expiry of the date prescribed in the Controller's orders. Therefore it is the date of deposit of cheque which is relevant for determining the date of payment. In the present case the date on which cheque was received by the claimants should be the date for payment provided it has been deposited and encashed the next day. The date of cheque itself may not be treated as date for payment of the cheque. In this regard I would refer to a very exhaustive judgment of the Supreme Court of India -- Renu Sagar Power Company v. General Electric Company and another AIR 1985 SC 1156. It was observed that the bill or promissory note can never go in the discharge of debts unless it is a part of the contract that it should be so. In this regard reference was made to Negotiable Instruments Act, by Beshayam and Adiga 14th Edition where principle has been summarized that:-
""It is always a question of intention of parties whether a bill or promissory note or cheque taken on account of a debt, operates as an absolute discharge of the debts, or only as conditional payment of it. Generally speaking a bill or note can never go in discharge of a debt un less it is a part of the contract that it should be so, for, a mere promise to pay, cannot be regarded as an effective payment. This rule may also be based on a general principle of law that one simply executor contract does not ordinarily extinguish another, the presumption in such cases is that the bill or promissory note is taken only as a conditional payment.""
Reference can also be made to Commissioner of Income Tax v. Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga AIR 1933 PC 108 where it was observed that, ""a debtor who gives his creditor a promissory note for the sum he owes can in no sense be said to pay his creditor, he merely gives him a document of voucher of debt possessing certain legal attributes. In Keshar Mill Co. Limited v. Commissioner of Income Tax AIR 1950 Bombay 166 where cheques and Hundis were issued in payment of price for goods sold and delivered, the question arose whether such cheques amounted to payment resulting unconditional discharge of liability to pay the price. Chagla Chief Justice observed, ""now I should have thought that ordinarily the payment of debt by cheque never results in the discharge of the debtor. A cheque merely represents an order by the drawer of the cheque to his banker to pay the amount to the person named in the cheque and till that payment is made, the debt is not discharged. Therefore, the sending of the cheque as it said before ordinarily is not unconditional discharge of the liability."" It was further observed that there may be arrangement between a creditor and a debtor that the receipt of a cheque or hundi not being honoured the creditor would have no right to sue on the original cause of action but only on the cheque or hundi."" Apply these principles to the facts of the case, I find that there was no such arrangement between parties that issuance, dispatch or receipt of cheque would amount to payment. Since cheque was received on 23rd June 1977 which was honoured on 24th June 1997 payment shall be deemed to have been made on 24th June 1997. In view of the above discussion the respondent have failed to pay AIP 5 within the time stipulated by the contract. The claimants were entitled to invoke clause 69 and seek remedies provided therein. The notice dated 21.6.1997 was valid.""
12.
 The learned Sole Arbitrator has come to the conclusion that the first date was to be included, and therefore, the last date of payment of IPC No.5 was 20.06.1997, whereas, though the cheque was issued on 20.06.1997 but the same was received on 23.06.1997 and was encashed on the next date i.e. 24.06.1997, and therefore, admittedly there was a default on the part of the Defendant. After coming to this conclusion, the learned Sole Arbitrator has further held that the Notice dated 21.06.1997 was a valid Legal Notice in terms of COC. In coming to this conclusion i.e. to include the first day as well as to hold that the payment made through a cheque is only valid when the cheque is encashed and not from the date of issuance of cheque, reliance has been placed on three Judgments from the Indian jurisdiction i.e. AIR 1985 Supreme Court 1156 (Renusagar Power Co. Ltd., v. General Electric Company and another) AIR 1933 PC 108 (Commissioner of Income-tax Behar and Orissa v. Kameshwar Singh of Darblianga) and AIR 1950 Bombay 166 (Keshav Mills Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay Mofussil). With respect I may observe that none of these three Judgments have any relevant facts as compared to instant matter. The Judgment in the case of Reno Power Sagar Power Cornty (supra) has perhaps been wrongly cited in this matter as it relates to the Foreign Arbitration Award and perhaps to my understanding has not dealt with the controversy regarding validity of the payment from the date of cheque or its encashment. The other two judgments have also dealt with altogether different set of facts regarding the levy of Income Tax and the inclusion of the payment or Promissory Note received in lieu of a debt. I may observe that the accounting systems vary from an Assessee to Assessee, whereas, even otherwise they are of no relevance inasmuch as Income Tax Law at the relevant time has not been discussed by the learned Sole Arbitrator viz-a-viz the terms of Contract between the parties. The relevant portion in the Conditions of the Contract was stipulated in Clause-60(5) of Conditions of Contract Part-II, which reads as under:-
 
""Interim Payment Certificates
60. (1) (a) The Contractor Shall submit .
(b)
(c)
 .
 
""Materials for the Permanent Works

(5) (a) Payment to the Contractor of the amount due under each of Interim Payment Certificate issued by Engineer shall be made by the Employer within 45 days of such certificate being delivered to the Employer.
(b)
 In the event of nonpayment within the said period, interest shall accrue to the Contractor at a rate of ten percent per annum upon all sums unpaid from the date upon which the same should have been paid.""
""69. (1) In the event of the Employer:
(a)
 failing to pay to the Contractor the amount due under any certificate of the Engineer within thirty days after the same shall have become due under the terms of the Contract, subject to any deduction that the Employer is entitled to make under the Contract, or
(b)
 Interfering with or obstructing or refusing any required approval to the issue of any such certificate, or
(c)
 becoming bankrupt or, being a company, going into liquidation, other than for the purpose of a scheme of reconstruction or amalgamation, or
(d)
 giving formal notice to the Contractor that for unforeseen reasons, due to economic dislocation, it is impossible for him to continue to meet his contractual obligations the Contractor shall be entitled to terminate his employment under the Contract after giving fourteen days prior written notice to the Employer, with a copy to the Engineer.""
13.
 Clause-60(5)(a) provides that payment to the Contractor of the amount under each of the IPC's duly issued by the Engineer shall be made by the Employer (Defendant) within 45 days of such Certificate being delivered to the Employer, whereas sub-clause (b) provides for accrual of interest to the Contractor, at the rate of 10%. Similarly Clause-69 of COC deals with default of Employer (Defendant) and it provides that in the event of the Employer failing to pay to the Contractor the amount due under any Certificate of the Engineer within 30 days (admittedly extended to 60 days), after the same shall have become due under the terms of the Contract subject to any deduction that the Employer is entitled to make under the Contract; and Clause (d) thereof provides that the Contractor shall be entitled to terminate his employment under the Contract after giving 14 days prior notice to the Employer with a copy to the Engineer. In nutshell, the first part i.e. Clause-60 provides a period of 45 days after issuance of IPC, and the same stands extended to a further 60 days and there appears to be no dispute that the total number of days is 105 in the aggregate. The only question is that how the word ""within"" is to be interpreted i.e. whether the date on which IPC was delivered is to be included or excluded. In the case of M/s. Shahi Textile (supra) a learned Division Bench of this Court had the occasion to interpret more or less similar and analogous provision as contained in Section 10(2) of the Financial Institutions (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance, 2001, which reads as under:-
""The defendant shall file the application for leave to defend within thirty days of the date of first service by any one of the modes laid down in subsection (5) of section 9....""
14.
 The aforesaid provision provides that the Defendant shall file the application for leave to defend within 30 days of the date of first service by any one of the modes laid down in Subsection (5) of Section 9 of FIO, 2001. The case before the learned Division Bench was to the effect that how this 30 days period is to be calculated or counted and whether or not the date of service would be included or excluded in counting the limitation. The terms of the contract in this matter between the parties is more or less on the same footing, and therefore, I am of the considered view that the interpretation arrived at by the learned Division Bench in the aforesaid case squarely applies to this case as well. The learned Division Bench also had the occasion of taking assistance from Section 9 of the General Clauses Act 1897. The relevant finding of the learned Division Bench is as under:-
As is clear from the foregoing, whenever the word ""from"" is used, the first day has to be excluded. This does not however mean that if the word ""from"" is not used; the first day has to be included. It is to be noted that there is no requirement under the General Clauses Act that the use of the word ""of"" would cause the first day to be included. Whether or not the first day is to be included or excluded would therefore depend on the statutory provisions and the context in which they appear. On a consideration of the 2001 Ordinance, we are of the view that the correct interpretation of section 10(2) is that the day on which the summons is served is to be excluded. As correctly pointed out by learned counsel for the appellants, the summons must be in a specific form, and that form uses the word ""from"". The requirement that the summons be in the form specified is expressly stated in section 9(5). Thus, section 10(2) becomes applicable if and only if, service is affected by a summons in the form prescribed by section 9(5), and in one of the modes specified in that provision. It would in our view, be most inequitable to serve a summons on the defendant which informs him that he may file his leave to defend application within 30 days ""from"" service, and then compute the period of limitation on a basis that includes the day of service. A conjoint reading of these provisions therefore leads to the conclusion that the day of service of summons should be excluded from consideration. Secondly, and more generally, ""a court ought not to put such an interpretation upon a statute of limitation by implication and inference as may have a penalizing effect unless the court is forced to do so by irresistible force of the language used""; Makhanlal Roy Pramanick and others v. Pramathanath Basu and others AIR 1953 Cal. 50, 52. In our view, this principle can be usefully applied to the present situation. There is nothing expressly stated in section 10(2) that would require the inclusion of the day of service while computing the period of limitation, and inasmuch as such inclusion can have a penalizing effect by debarring the defendant from appearing in the suit, the preferable interpretation would be that the day of service should be excluded. Unless the relevant statutory language is clear, and admits to only one meaning, provisions relating to limitation should be construed in favour of preserving the rights of parties, whether that be the right of a plaintiff to sue or the right of a defendant to appear in the suit and defend himself. There is nothing in section 10(2) that points in one direction alone. Accordingly, the proper interpretation of this provision is as noted above.
7.
 We therefore conclude, with respect, that even under the 2001 Ordinance, the day of service of summons (through whichever mode is first effective) is to be excluded from consideration. On that basis, since summons in the present case was served through publication on 27-1-2010, the last day of limitation was 26-2-2010. That day was admittedly a holiday, and the first working day thereafter was 1-3-2010 on which date the leave to defend application was, filed. Accordingly, it was within time, and the learned single Judge, with respect, erred materially in coming to the contrary conclusion. The leave to defend application ought therefore to have been heard and decided on its merits. Since this had not been done, the appeal had to be allowed and the matter remanded to the learned single Judge in terms as stated in our short order.
15.
 There is another provision, which is more or less similar in nature as provided in the Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979 i.e. Section 10 under the head ""Payment of Rent"". This provision has been interpreted by various decisions of this Court as well as by the Honourable Supreme Court. In my view the same is also relevant to adjudicate the controversy in hand. Section 10 of SRPO, 1979 reads as under:-
""S.10 
Payment of rent
.--- (1) The rent shall, in the absence of any date fixed in this behalf by mutual agreement between the landlord and tenant, be paid not later than the tenth of the month next following the month for which it is due.
(2)
 The rent shall, as far as may be, be paid to the landlord, who shall acknowledge receipt thereof in writing.
(3)
 Where the landlord has refused or avoided to accept the rent, it may be sent to him by postal money order, be deposited with the Controller within whose jurisdiction the premises is situate.
(4)
 The written acknowledgement, postal money order receipt or receipt of the Controller, as the case may be shall be produced and accepted in proof of the payment of the rent:
Provided that nothing contained in this section shall apply in the case pending before the Controllers on the commencement of this Ordinance.""
16.
 Though apparently one could say that there is no exact similarity of words in the aforesaid provisions under the SRPO, 1979 viz-a-viz the provisions of the Contract in dispute. However, since in this matter there is also one issue that as to whether a payment would be deemed to be made within time, if a cheque is issued within the limitation period or on the date on which the limitation expires and whether such tender of payment through a cheque would result in default or not. There is a series of judgments that in the context of Section 10 of SRPO, 1979, the tender of payment through a cheque on the last date as provided therein would amount to a payment within due date irrespective of the fact that it was encashed subsequently after such date had expired. If any authority is needed, one may refer to the cases of (Messrs Mahmood Ahmad & sons v. M.A. Marker) reported in PLD 1983 Quetta 36, (Sarfaraz Khan v. Muhammad Abdul Rauf) reported in PLD 1969 Karachi 176 and (Messrs Peoples Steel Mills Ltd., Karachi v. Hafizuddin and 7 others) reported in PLD 1981 Karachi 739.
17.
 In the case of Muhammad Aslam and another v. Muhammad Amin (1996 SCMR 1646), the Honourable Supreme Court had the occasion to compute the period of 60 days and while doing so the date from which it was to be computed was excluded. The relevant finding reads as under:-
""4.
 We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and have also gone through the cases cited in the impugned judgment of the High Court which fully support the view taken by the learned Single Judge. In all these cases, it has been held that the principle embodied in section 9 of General Clauses Act and section 12(1) of Limitation Act namely, the date from which the period prescribed is reckoned is to be excluded, is a principle of equity which should generally be applied for interpreting/ construing the decrees and orders of the Courts. Section 9 of General Clauses Act in its relevant aspect provides ""In any Central Act -----, it shall be sufficient, for the purpose of excluding the first in a series of days or any other period of time, to use the word 'from' ------"". This provision came up for consideration in Puran Chand v. Muhammad Din and others (AIR 1935 Lahore 291) wherein it was held by a Division Bench of Lahore High Court that General Clauses Act embodies a principle of equity which should be applied to decrees apart from Statutes and that the date from which the period specified in the decree was to be reckoned should be excluded. Again in Ramchandra Govind Unavne v. Laxman Savleram Ronghe (AIR 1938 Bombay 447), the Bombay High Court while construing a decree, dated 23rd January, 1936 directing the defendant to pay Rs.200 ""within fifteen days frog, this day"" held that if these words occurred in a statute, the first day would be excluded by virtue of section 9 of General Clauses Act and the fifteenth day would expire on 7th February. It was further observed that section 9 would not apply in terms as the words did not occur in a statute ""but it is desirable for the sake of uniformity that the same interpretation should be given to an expression occurring in a judicial order as would be given to it in a statute, and I think, therefore, the expression 'fifteen days' would mean fifteen clear days; and that the date of making the order should be excluded"". Similar view was taken by Dacca High Court in the case of Abdus Sattar and others v. Abdul Khaliq and others (1971 DLC 239) wherein it was held that from a bare reading of the provisions of section 9 of the General Clauses Act and section 12(1) of the Limitation Act; it appeared that in computing the period prescribed in any order passed by' the Court, ""the date on which the order was passed shall have to be excluded. It was also observed that there have been a series of decisions for the view that the equitable principle contained in section 9 of General Clauses Act should ordinarily be applied to the construction of decrees and orders passed by the Courts unless there is something repugnant in the subject or context. Support for the view that in computing the period mentioned in the order, the date of. The order should be excluded was also drawn from Halsbury's Law of England 2nd Edition, Volume 32, p.138 which is reproduced hereunder:-
""When a period of time running from a given day or event to another day or event is prescribed by law or, fixed by contract and the question arises whether their computation is to be made inclusively or exclusively of the first mentioned or of the last mentioned day, regard must be had to the context and the purpose for which the computation has to be made. Where there is room for doubt, the enactment or instrument ought to be so construed as to effectuate and not to defeat the intention of Parliament or of the parties, as the case may be, expression such as ' from such a day' or 'until such a day' are equivocal since they do not make it clear whether the inclusion or the exclusion of the day named may be intended. As a general rule however, the effect of defining a period in such a manner is to exclude the first day and to include in the last day. Both days must be included if the word 'inclusive' is added.""
Peshawar High Court in the case of Sher Muhammad and 6 others v. Gulfraz (1989 CLC 1344) also affirmed the aforenoted view. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioners was unable to cite any decision to the contrary nor did he dispute the factual position that if 8th of March, 1993 was excluded from computation of sixty days period, the deposit made on 8th May would be within time as 7th May happened to be Friday. He, however, sought to contend that the equatable principle relied upon by the learned Judge in the High Court could not justifiably be invoked in the instant case so as to exclude 8th of March because it was decided with the agreement of the parties that the period of sixty days would commence from the said date. This contention is not borne out from the proceedings recorded and the order passed by the Court on 7-3-1993 which shows that it was directed/clarified by the Court that the period of sixty days would commence from 8-3-1993. In any case, it was a part of the Court's order/decree. The learned Judge in the High Court was, therefore, right in holding that while computing the period of sixty days, 8th of March must be excluded in view of the settled legal position aforenoted.
5.
 Upshot of the above discussion is that there is no merit in these petitions, which are accordingly dismissed and the leave sought is refused.""
19.(sic) In the case of (Messrs Mahmood Ahmad & Sons v. M.A. Marker) reported as PLD 1983 Quetta 36, the relevant finding reads as under:-
""6.
 The next question which falls for determination is whether the rent had been paid on the specified date as mentioned in the order of Controller? The learned counsel for the respondent has stated that the payment would be considered from the date of receipts. It has not been disputed by the respondent that the cheques were delivered to the respondent on the dates mentioned in the cheques. If we accept the dates of the cheques, then the rent for the months of June, 1977 was paid in time. Similarly the rent for the month of April and May, 1980 had been paid in time. The payments would be considered from the date of cheque as held in Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay v. Messrs Ogal Glass Works Ltd. (AIR 1954 SC 429) it has been observed:-
""The position, therefore, is that in view of the matter there was, in the circumstances of this case, an implied agreement under which the cheques were accepted unconditionally as payment and on another view, even if the cheques were taken conditionally, the cheques not having been dishonoured but having been cashed the payment related back to the dates of receipt of the cheques and in law the dates of payments were the dates of the delivery of the cheques.""
20.
 In the case of (Messrs Peoples Steel Mills Ltd., Karachi v. Hafizuddin and 7 others) reported as PLD 1981 Karachi 739, the relevant finding reads as under:-
""This Ordinance does allow payment of rent by cheque as between landlord and tenant as stated above but does not Disallow such mode of payment under section 13(6). In these, circumstances it can be said that in compliance of the tentative rent order if the payment of rent is made by the tenant by way of cheque and that is accepted and the cheque is honoured and no objection is raised then it is valid tender otherwise if the cheque is dishonoured or objection is raised to such mode of payment then the tender will not be considered as valid and the tenant will be liable for default. Presentation of cheque may be considered a valid payment in contractual liability but not in statutory liability as contemplated under section 13(6) of the Ordinance.""
21.
 In the case of (Sarfaraz Khan v. Muhammad Abdul Rauf) reported as PLD 1969 Karachi 176, the relevant finding reads as under:-
""The rule that tender should be in current coins or in currency notes rests on the old English decisions which were given at the time when tender of cheques was not the popular or universally recognised mode for discharge of liabilities. It will be noted, however, that with the passage of time, the Courts, both in England as well as in this sub-continent, evolved important exceptions to this rule. The question is, whether there is no scope to evolve any further exception to the rule now when it has become an established and universally recognised practice to discharge liabilities by tender of cheques. In my opinion, in the context of the modern conditions, it will be reasonable to hold that tender of cheque is a valid tender, unless the creditor expressly objects to such tender, or unless there is an express provision in the arrangement between the creditor and the debtor that the latter should discharge his liability only by tender of money in current coins or currency notes issued under the authority of some statute. In adopting this rule, I would venture to say that I am not departing from the rules which have been laid down from time to time by the Courts in England and in this sub-continent on the point under consideration. I feel that I am only extending the scope of the exceptions, which have been established by judicial consensus, to the present day conditions. If this view is taken of the question, then tender by the appellant of the arrears of rent and of the rent for August 1964, by cheque cannot be rejected as invalid tender, because it has not been shown that the landlord, in his dealings with the appellant, ever raised any express objection to payment of rent by cheque, nor has it been shown that the agreement between the parties required that tender of rent should be only in current coins or currency notes.
7.
 In the instant case, the question which really arises for decision is not whether the appellant made a legal tender of the arrears of rent due from, but whether the appellant made default in complying with the order of the Controller made under section 13(6) of the West Pakistan Urban Rent Restriction Ordinance, 1959. In my view, if deposit is made in the Controller's office by cheque and payment on this cheque is received by the Controller, then the tenant cannot be deemed to be in default, unless the deposit of the cheque itself was made B after the expiry of the date prescribed in the Controller's order. This, I would venture to say, would be a correct and sensible approach to the question of valid or invalid payments of rent and arrears to the landlord or to the Controller under section 13(6) of the aforesaid Ordinance.""
22. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Ibrahim Trust. Karachi v. Shaheen Freight Services (PLD 2011 SC 331), had the occasion to examine a somewhat similar provision under the SRPO, 1979 and so also the orders of the learned Rent Controller who had directed the tenant to deposit further monthly rent of every month on or before 10th of each calendar month. The precise question was to the effect that whether the order would stand complied with if Pay Order of the rent is furnished to the Court on 10th or on the date when such Pay Order is actually released and credited in the account of the landlord. The relevant observations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court are as under:-
""10.
 We may also observe here that although there is no ambiguity to this legal position, but even if for argument sake, we examine the question of default qua striking off the defence of a tenant on the premises as claimed by the appellant, firstly, when two equally logical interpretations of a rent order, entailing penal consequences were possible, as may be in the instant case, then the one favourable to the subject was to be given preference i.e. no contemplation for payment of any advance rent was to be deduced from the language of such rent order to the prejudice of tenants, secondly, as rightly held by learned Single Judge in Chambers of the High Court of Sindh in his impugned judgment dated 19-2-2010, deposit of pay orders in the Bank on the 10th of each month, under valid challans issued by the Nazarat office was due compliance of the rent orders by the tenants, irrespective of the fact when payment of such pay orders was collected or realized from the concerned Bank by its encashment.""
23. Similarly in the case reported as Khursheed Begum and others v. Inam-ur-Rehman Khan and others (PLD 2009 Lahore 552), a learned Division Bench of Lahore High Court had the occasion to examine a situation that as to whether a payment made through a cheque could be treated as a valid payment on issuance of such cheque within the contemplation of Order XXI, Rule 84, C.P.C. The relevant observations are as under:-
19.
 About the question raised by the Court auctioneer that the payment of 1/4 amount on the date of the auction could be received by him through cheque, though this has not been controverted by Mr. Kazmi, however, it may be held according to Order XXI, Rule 84, C.P.C. ""On every sale of immovable property the person declared to be the purchaser shall pay immediately after such declaration a deposit of twenty-five per cent, on the amount of his purchase-money to the officer or other person conducting the sale and in default of such deposit, the property shall forthwith be re-sold."" Thus it is mandatory provision that 1/4th should be deposited with the Court auctioneer and if not he is bound to re-sell the property forthwith; this conforms to the spirit of the law that quite steps and legal formalities are undertaken before the auction is conducted and if the successful bidder runs away and the auction remains unsuccessful on that count, again all the legal niceties have to be followed, which shall be an abuse of the process of law and the chance of re-sale there and then shall be gone and frustrated; it is in the above context that the law envisages a cash payment and even m otherwise when the law (the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908) was enforced, the banking system as it is today, was not in place, therefore, the payment through cheque could not be conceived, however, because of the change circumstances, now a days it is a real risk and peril to carry huge money, thus the payment through cheques can be read into the provision as this shall not militate against the spirit of Order XXI, Rule 84, C.P.C, but the successful bidder along with the cheque should also establish by providing the latest Bank statement to the Court auctioneer that he has the requisite funds in the account from where the cheque is issued and if it is otherwise, the Court auctioneer in the light of the command of law should re-sell the property forthwith, otherwise the law for the resale shall be infringed; besides the consequences of Order XXI, Rule 71, C.P.C. shall get waste and frustrated.
24.
 In the case reported as K. Saraswathy alias K. Kalpana v. P.S.S. Somasundaram Chettiar (1990 MLD 413), the Honorable Supreme Court of India had the occasion to examine the deposit of amount in Court on certain directions, through cheque, and it was held that tender of cheque on the last day stipulated in the order of the Court, realized subsequently, would be a valid payment within time. The relevant observation reads as under;
5.
 It is contended before us on behalf of the appellant that the cheque for Rs.6,02,000 was tendered in Court on 29th May, 1980 and that it was duly honoured by the Bank and money was realised under the cheque, and therefore it must be taken that payment had been effected by the appellant on 29th May, 1980 within the time stipulated by this Court in its order dated 29th November, 1979. In Commr. of Income-tax, Bombay South, Bombay v. Ogale Glass Works Ltd. Ogale Wadi, AIR 1954 SC 429 it was laid down by this Court that payment by cheque realised subsequently on the cheque being honoured and encashed relates back to the date of the receipt of the cheque, and in law the date of payment is the date of delivery of the cheque. Payment by cheque is an ordinary incident of present day life, whether commercial or private, and unless it is specifically mentioned that payment must be in cash there is no reason why payment by cheque should not be taken to be due payment if the cheque is subsequently encashed in the ordinary course. There is nothing in the order of this Court providing that the deposit by the appellant was to be in cash. The terms of the order dated 29th November, 1979 are conclusive in this respect and it is the intent of that order which will determine whether payment by cheque within the period stipulated in that order was excluded as a mode in satisfaction of the terms of that order. The time for payment is governed by the order of this Court.
6.
 It is alleged on behalf of the respondent that there was no money on the date of delivery of the cheque to support payment of it and that it was subsequently when arrangements were made that the cheque was realised. Now, the High Court has not found that if the cheque was presented for encashment on the date it was delivered the cheque would not have been encashed. There is nothing to suggest also that the cheque was not honoured in due course and that the Bank had at any time declined to honour it for want of funds in the ordinary course. In any event, there is nothing to suggest that, under the arrangements made for payment of the cheque, even if it had been encashed on the date it was delivered the cheque would not have been encashed. There is no finding by the High Court that on 29th May, 1980 the cheque would not have been realised. That being so, the question whether the appellant had wrongly stated that her counsel had offered to pay cash to the High Court office on 29th May, 1980 ceases to be relevant. We also see no substance in the objection taken before the High Court that in the letter dated 29th May, 1980 addressed by counsel for the appellant forwarding the cheque for Rs.6,02,000 there was a request for the return of the cheque in case it was found that the appellant was entitled to the set-off claimed by her. The application of the appellant claiming adjustment was pending in Court, and no conclusion can be drawn against her on the ground that she had requested a return of the cheque in the event of the adjustment being allowed by the Court.
7.
 We are of the view that the conditions set forth in the order of this Court dated 29th November, 1979 in the facts and the circumstances of the case have been complied with by the appellant substantially and she is entitled to the benefit of that order.
25.
 The upshot of the above discussion is that the last date for payment of IPC No.5 duly certified by the Engineer on 8.3.1997 was 21.6.1997 and not 20.6.1997 as concluded by the learned Arbitrator. The 1st day i.e. 8.3.1997 is not to be included but is to be excluded for calculation of the total period of payment (45+60=105 days), and therefore, the payment could have been made by 21.6.1997, whereas, admittedly the cheque was duly issued on 20.6.1997 (the question of its delivery now being academic in view of the above discussion). The said cheque was accepted and encashed by the Plaintiff on 24.6.1997 without any obstacle and or delay by the Bank, therefore in view of the above discussion and precedents of various Courts, the date of payment will be deemed to be 20.6.1997 on which date the cheque was issued and was subsequently encashed. Therefore, there was no default on the part of Defendant in payment of IPC-5, and plaintiff had no cause of action to invoke or exercise the option of termination of Contract in terms of clauses 60 and 69 of COC. Since I have come to a definite conclusion that payment made was within the period specified in the contract, therefore, there is no need to give any finding with regard to the issue that whether the notice issued by the plaintiff duly fulfilled the conditions of the contract or not. Accordingly the entire claim lodged on the basis of such alleged default falls on ground as the contract could not have been terminated for such alleged default; consequently no damages as claimed could have been granted or even considered. This conclusion responds to Issue Nos. III and IV, whereas, in view of this conclusion no further discussion is required in respect of remaining Issues. Accordingly the objection raised by the defendant under sections 30 and 33 of the Arbitration Act, 1940, are sustained and the impugned Award dated 23.07.199 is hereby set aside.
26.
 Award is hereby set aside.

 JAWAD HASSAN, J.---
Through the instant Intra Court Appeal the Appellants have called in question the legality of impugned order dated 12.03.2015 passed in Writ Petition No.22736/2012 by the learned Single Judge whereby he allowed the writ petition filed by the Respondent No.1 directing the Appellants to pay to the Respondent No.1 a sum of Rs.600,000/- representing the second installment of the project.
2.
 Brief facts revealing from this Appeal are that the Respondent No.1 filed W.P. No.22736/2012 seeking a direction to the Appellant No.1 to release the second installment and to pay the enhanced cost of the project of construction of soling, drains, culverts, earth filling, park, sewerage Mufatpura Tara Ghar UC No.14 Ghohar Hithar @ 30 to 40% as per existing schedule of rates of Punjab Local Government (the ""PLG""), which was allowed by the learned Single Judge vide the impugned order. Hence, the instant Appeal.
3.
 Learned counsel for the Appellants submitted that the impugned order is against law and facts as the Respondent No.1 had not made party to TMA Kasur in the writ petition; that the payment to the Respondent No.1 was made for the work done but for the work which has not been done cannot be paid which fact has been ignored by the learned Single Judge; that the learned Single Judge has not taken into consideration the fact that the Respondent No.1 was seeking advance payment for the work which was to be done as yet; that the project was cancelled on 08.01.2015 and the same has not been challenged by anyone, as such the petition had become infructuous; that it was a matter of contractual obligation which cannot be resolved in writ jurisdiction. In support of his contentions learned counsel has placed reliance on the case titled Nagina Bakery v. Sui Southern Gas Limited and 3 others (2001 CLC 1559), Amir Nawaz Khan and 2 others v. Government of Pakistan through Secretary, Finance, Islamabad and 5 others (2001 CLC 185) and Lahore Cantonment Cooperative Housing Society Limited, Lahore Cantt., through Secretary v. Dr. Nusrat Ullah Chaudhry and others (PLD 2002 Supreme Court 1068).
4.
 We have heard the arguments of the learned counsel for the Appellants and examined the record available with this Appeal.
5.
 The main grievance of the Respondent No.1 in the writ petition was that a direction be issued to the Appellants to release second installment and to pay the enhanced cost of the project @ 30% to 40% as per existed scheduled rates of the PLG. The Appellants submitted report and parawise comments to contest the writ petition filed by the Respondent No.1. The thorough examination of the whole report and parawise comments reflects that nowhere in the same the payment of second installments has been denied by the Appellants rather it has been specifically mentioned in it that keeping in view the sensitively of the matter, Administrator Kasur has constituted a committee vide order No.78 ADM TMA KASUR dated 15.09.2012 for scrutiny/visit of old CCB's file/project who have applied for the next installment, to avoid any irregularity and erroneous payment (copy attached). The subject CCB matter shall also be reviewed by the committee and proceeded in the light of recommendation of the committee.
6.
 From the above, it is crystal clear that the Appellants have never denied the claim of the Respondent No.1 rather the same has been made conditional attaching with the recommendation of the committee constituted for scrutiny to avoid any irregularity and erroneous payment as allegedly multiple projects of the same nature were under pipeline in the jurisdiction of the Appellants. As such, the learned Single Judge has rightly held that the report was filed way back on 21.11.2012 but till date (12.03.2015) no decision was made on the payment of the bill for second installment amounting to Rs.600,000/- and the Appellants have failed to give any reasons for such a considerable delay in payment of the said installment despite the fact that the bill was submitted on 10.05.2011. Reliance in this regard can be placed on the case titled Messrs Usmani Associates v. Pakistan Housing Authority through Managing Director and 2 others (2005 MLD 233) wherein this Court held as under:
""Contents of the petition about non-payment of verified amount was not denied rather non-availability of funds was pleaded. On such admission in the pleadings or otherwise any party could apply for judgment or order to be made by the Court.""
7.
 Furthermore, the grounds taken by the Appellants in reply to the writ petition were duly dealt with by the learned Single Judge but the rest of the grounds raised before this Division Bench through filing the instant Appeal were not taken by the Appellants before the learned Single Judge, as such cannot be allowed to be agitated before this Division Bench as the same were available to them before passing the impugned order. The learned counsel for the Appellants has failed to point out any illegality or perversity in the impugned order which has been passed in consonance with the spirit of law. The case law relied upon by the learned counsel for the Appellants are distinguishable from the case in hand as each and every case has its own facts and circumstances, therefore, cannot be relied upon.
8.
 We agree with the finding of the learned Single Judge and see no illegality or jurisdictional error in the impugned order which has been passed in line with the dictates of law and does not warrant any interference by this Division Bench.
9.
 Resultantly, the instant Appeal is devoid of any merit and is accordingly dismissed.

21,"ZAHOOR AHMAD SHAH alias PHOOL SHAH Versus ELECTION TRIBUNAL, SAHIWAL DIVISION","June 9, 2017",LAHORE HIGH COURT LAHORE, Honorable Justice Muzamil Akhtar Shabir ,2018 CLC 1032,"JUDGMENT
 MUZAMIL AKHTAR SHABIR, J.---
This constitutional petition is directed against the order dated 22.11.2016 passed by the Election Tribunal, Sahiwal Division, Sahiwal, ('Election Tribunal') whereby the application filed by the respondents Nos.2 and 3 for amendment of the election petition by impleading two new sets of respondents, namely, Anees-ul-Mehdi along with Javaid Iqbal and Rustam Qurban along with Muhammad Amin, who were contesting candidates for the post of Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Union Council was allowed and the application filed by the petitioners for dismissal of the election petition for the reason of non-impleading necessary parties was dismissed.
2.
 The brief facts of the case are that the petitioners, respondent Nos.2 to 9 and four other persons contested election held on 31.10.2015, for the office of Chairman and Vice-Chairman of Union Council-122, District Okara. The petitioners were declared as returned candidates through result notified in the official gazette on 21.12.2015. On 18.01.2016, the Respondents Nos. 2 and 3 challenged the afore mentioned notification by filing election petition before the Election Tribunal. The petitioners contested the said petition by filing written reply on 11.04.2016. On 07.05.2016 respondents Nos.2 and 3 filed an application before Election Tribunal to seek amendment of pleadings by impleading the afore-referred four persons (two sets of contesting candidates) as respondents in the petition. On 19.05.2016, the petitioners filed an application for dismissal of the election petition and on 27.05.2016 filed reply to the application for amendment filed by respondents Nos.2 and 3. The Election Tribunal vide order dated 22.11.2016 dismissed the application filed by the petitioners for dismissal of the election petition and allowed the application filed by respondents Nos.2 and 3 for impleading additional respondents. The petitioners have called in question the order dated 22.11.2016 through this constitutional petition.
3.
 This Court issued notices to the respondents for 18.01.2017 on which date despite service respondents Nos.2 to 9 did not appear in the Court, therefore, this Court on the said date proceeded ex parte against the said respondents. However, subsequently counsel for the respondents Nos.2 and 3 appeared in the Court, who has been heard. With the consent of learned counsel for both the parties, the petition is admitted to regular hearing and is being decided as an admitted case.
4.
 The learned counsel for the petitioners has argued that according to Section 38 of the Punjab Local Government Act, 2013 and Rule 63 of the Punjab Local Government (Conduct of Elections) Rules, 2013 (""Rules, 2013"") all the contesting candidates were required to be impleaded as parties to contest the election petition and as the respondents did not implead the afore referred four candidates in the array of the parties, therefore, election petition was liable to be rejected / dismissed on this ground. He further contended that Election Tribunal was not justified to allow the respondents Nos.2 and 3 to implead the afore-referred four persons as respondents in this petition. Relies upon the judgment reported as Haji Khawand Bux Ghulam Muhammad Jahejo v. Sharjeel Inam Memon and 23 others (PLD 2016 Sindh 92) and Jaleel Ahmed v. Election Commission of Pakistan through Chief Election Commissioner and 8 others (2017 YLR 557) to argue that failure to implead necessary parties to the election petition (i.e. contesting candidates) is fatal to the election petition and the application for amendment has been filed as an afterthought and warranted to be declined.
5.
 The learned counsel for the respondents Nos.2 and 3 has supported the decision of the case and argued that the relevant law does not provide that the election petition is mandatorily to be dismissed during trial for the defect of non-impleading of contesting candidates and the judgments relied upon by the petitioners are not applicable to the present case.
6.
 The question for determination before this Court is whether the election petition is liable to be dismissed during trial for non-impleading of contesting candidates.
7.
 The case of Haji Khawand Bux Ghulam Muhammad Jahejo v. Sharjeel Inam Memon and 23 others (PLD 2016 Sindh 92) relates to the General Elections of 2013, wherein Representation of People Act, 1976 (`ROPA') was under consideration and the court held that non-joining of a contesting candidate was fatal to the election petition. In the said case the controversy revolved around sections 54(a) and 63 of the Representation of Peoples Act, 1976. The relevant sections are reproduced below:
""54. Parties to the petition.---The petitioner shall join as respondents to his election petition
 (a) all contesting candidates; and
(b) any other candidate against whom any allegation of any corrupt or illegal practice is made and shall serve personally or by registered post on each such respondent a copy of the petition.
Explanation.- In this section and in the following provisions of this chapter, ""corrupt or illegal practice"" means a ""corrupt practice"" or an ""illegal practice"" within the meaning of Chapter VIII.
63. Dismissal of petition during trial.---The Tribunal shall dismiss an election petition, if
 (a) the provisions of section 54 or section 55 have not been complied with; or
(b) if the petitioner fails to make the further deposit required under subsection (4) of section 62.""
In the afore-referred case as per section 54(a), the election petitioners was required to implead all the contesting candidates as parties to the petition and section 63 provided that the Tribunal shall dismiss the election petition for non-compliance of provision of section 54. The court held the said provision to be mandatory and dismissed the election petition for its non-compliance.
8.
 The case of Jaleel Ahmed (supra) relates to Local Government Elections held in the province of Sindh under the Sindh Local Councils (Election) Rules, 2015 and deals with rules 61 and 64, thereof, which are reproduced below:
 ""61. The Petitioner shall join as respondents to his election petition--
 (a) all contesting candidates; and
(b) any other person against whom any allegation, if any, of corrupt or illegal practice is made and shall serve personally or by courier service or registered post on each such respondent a copy of his petition.
64. If the Tribunal is satisfied that all or any of the preceding provisions have not been complied with, the petition shall be dismissed forthwith and submit its report to the Election Commission.""
In the said case the relevant portion of the judgment is reproduced below:
""In the case reported as Zia Ur Rehman v. Syed Ahmed Hussain (2014 SCMR 1015), wherein the Hon'ble apex Court has held that when the law prescribes a certain format of an Election Petition and its verification on oath and entails a penal consequences of its non-compliance. It is a mandatory provision. If an objection is raised with regard to maintainability of such a petition for non-compliance of a mandatory provision, the Court/Tribunal should decide that preliminary objection. Because if that objection is sustained then the Court is left with no option but to dismiss the petition.""
In the said case the election petition was dismissed because of non-compliance of mandatory provision of verification of the petition as required by rule 62(3) of the Sindh Local Councils (Election) Rules, 2015. In the said case the relevant law provided that non-impleading of necessary parties and failure of verification of election petition would result in its dismissal.
9.
 Although both the afore-referred cases relate to Election laws but the same do not relate to the dispute under consideration in the present election petition under the Punjab Local Government Act, 2013 and rules framed thereunder, rather the afore referred Act of 1976 refers to the election for the Provincial and National Assemblies and Sindh Local Councils (Election) Rules relates to local Government Elections in province of Sindh.
The present dispute relates to the Punjab Local Government Act, 2013 and Rules framed thereunder. Section 38 of Punjab Local Government Act, 2013 is reproduced below:
""38. Election petition.---(1) Subject to this Act, an election to an office of a Local Government shall not be called in question except by an election petition.
(2) A candidate may, in the prescribed manner, file an election petition before the Election Tribunal challenging an election under this Act.""
Rule 63(1) of the Rules, 2013 is reproduced below:---
""63(1). Parties to the petition.---(1) The petitioner shall join all contesting candidates as respondents to his election petition and shall serve personally or by registered post (acknowledgment due) on each respondent a copy of his petition.
 ..........""
10.
 As per section 38 an election can only be called in question by filing an election petition by a candidate in the prescribed manner before the Election Tribunal. Rule 63 provides that the petitioner is required to join all contesting candidates to the election petition and serve personally or by registered post on each respondent a copy of his petition. However, no consequence has been provided for the noncompliance of the afore-referred provision and the same does not make the election petition as liable to be dismissed as is provided in ROPA, 1976 or the Sindh Local Government (Conduct of Elections) Rules, 2015. The rule 70 of the Rules, 2013 applicable in Punjab provides for dismissal of the petition during trial which is re-produced below:
""70. Dismissal of petition during trial.---
The Tribunal may dismiss an election petition if---
(a)
 The provisions of rules 67 and 68 have not been complied with; or
(b)
 The allegation contained therein are vague or do not disclose the commission of any corrupt practice, material irregularity or any other illegal act""
11.
 In the afore referred rules, the grounds for dismissal of election petition are that provisions of Rules 67 and 68 are not complied with or the allegations contained in the petition are vague or do not disclose the commission of any corrupt practice, material irregularity or any other illegality. Rule 67 provides for appearance of parties before the Tribunal including appearance as a consequence of order passed by the Tribunal and rule 68 provides for procedure before Tribunal. Both the afore-referred rules do not relate to the parties to be impleaded in the election petition. No other ground has been mentioned in the rule 70 providing for dismissal of the petition during trial. Usually a provision prescribing some legal consequences for non-compliance of a provision is treated as mandatory as mentioned in the case reported as Zia ur Rehman v. Syed Ahmed Hussain (2014 SCMR 2015). However, in the present case no consequence is provided for not impleading contesting candidates as parties to the petition, therefore, the same can be treated as a directory provision.
12.
 The learned counsel for the petitioners has argued that as the provision of the ROPA and Local Government laws applicable in Sindh are similar to the Rules, 2013 therefore, on the basis of the said laws and interpretation given in the judgments cited above, the provision of section 63 is to be treated as mandatory. What is not given in this rule cannot be read into the said rule by this Court by referring to the provisions of ROPA, 1976, and laws applicable in Province of Sindh as it would amount to doing violence to the provisions of law as provided in the Local Government Act, 2013 as well as Rules, 2013. Reliance in this regard may be placed on Zahid Iqbal v. Hafiz Muhammad Adnan and others (2016 SCMR 430) wherein it has been laid down as under:
""It is, not the function of the Court to read into any provision and or words that are not part of the statute, unless imported or made applicable specifically as has been done under the Sindh Local Government Act, 2013, wherein section 36(j) clearly imports disqualification ""under any law"" it reads ""he is for the time being disqualified or chosen as a member of the Provincial Assembly under any law for the time being in force."" It is neither the duty nor the function of the Court to read into or delete any word and or provisions in an enactment, unless specifically adopted or imported by reference. Courts do not legislate but interpret statute according to their ordinary and plain meaning and do not import and or supply word or provisions from ""any other law"", no matter how laudable and desirable it may appear to be. In this view of the matter, disqualification prescribed under ""any law"" or even in ""The Constitution"" unless as noted above are specifically made applicable or adopted by reference, specially penal and or castigatory provisions contained in ""any law"" cannot be imported, read into or inflicted on a person who put forth his candidature to be elected as a Member or to hold an elected office of Punjab Local Government but his qualification and or disqualification for any office of the Punjab Local Government is to be adjudged strictly under the provisions of ""the Act, 2013"" only.""
In view of the principle laid down in the afore referred judgments of the Supreme Court, it is held that the provisions of rule 63 are not mandatory but directory.
13.
 Keeping in view what has been discussed above, ground to dismiss the election petition during trial on the basis of not impleading contesting candidates is not made out. Consequently it is observed that the Election Tribunal has rightly dismissed the application filed by the petitioners for dismissal of the afore-referred petition. However, it is observed that the learned Election Tribunal is not precluded from determining on merits of the case, the effect of not impleading parties to the Election petition at the time of final disposal of the election petition by keeping in view the contents of the Election petition and the evidence and material available on the record, which shall be decided without being influenced by any of the observations made in this decision.
14.
 As regard to the amendment of the election petition by adding additional parties allowed by the Election Tribunal, reference may be made to Rule 68(5) which provides as under:
""68. Procedure before Tribunal.--
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
 The Tribunal may, at any time, on such terms and on payment of such costs as it may direct, allow a petition to be amended in such a manner as may, in its opinion, be necessary for ensuring a fair and effective trial and for determining the real questions in controversy, provided that no new ground of challenge to the election is permitted to be raised.""
15.
 According to the afore referred rule, the Election Tribunal is competent to allow amendment of the petition subject to the terms and conditions it thinks fit provided no new ground of challenge to the election is sought to be added by the petitioner. The Election Tribunal has imposed cost of Rs.10,000/- upon respondents Nos. 2 and 3 for allowing them to make the afore-referred contesting candidates as respondents in this petition. The permission to amend the petition was discretionary with the Election Tribunal which discretion has been exercised by it on the basis of material available before it. This Court in constitutional petition does not ordinarily interfere in the discretionary orders passed by the Court/Tribunal of competent jurisdiction unless the same suffer from illegality, perversity or erroneous exercise of jurisdiction.
16.
 No illegality, infirmity, perversity or erroneous exercise of jurisdiction has been pointed out in the orders passed by Election Tribunal therefore, no ground for interference is made out.
17.
 For what has been discussed above, this petition being devoid of any merit is dismissed.

22,AQEEL AHMED alias TILOO Versus State,"June 9, 2017",KARACHI HIGH COURT SINDH, Honorable Justice Abdul Maalik Gaddi ,2018 PCrLJN 12,"JUDGMENT
 ABDUL MAALIK GADDI, J.---
Through instant appeal, the appellant has challenged the Judgment dated 23.12.2015 passed by the learned Judge, Anti-Terrorism Court No.1, Karachi in Special Case No.A-304 of 2014 (Re: The State v. Aqeel Ahmed alias Tiloo) arising out of Crime No.425 of 2014 registered under Section 4/5 Explosive Substance Act, read with Section 7 ATA, 1997 of police station Zaman Town, Karachi, whereby the learned trial Court after full dressed trial convicted and sentenced the appellant in point No.02 of the impugned judgment. For the sake of convenience, it would be appropriate to reproduce Point No.2 of the said judgment, which reads as under:-
""In view of my findings on point No. I, the prosecution has proved its charge against the accused Aqeel Ahmed alias Tiloo son of Din Muhammad beyond any shadow of doubt, I, therefore, convict him under section 265-H(2) and sentence him R.I. for 14 years, for the offence punishable under section 70 of Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. The benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C. is also extended to him. Accused Aqeel Ahmed alias Tiloo son of Din Muhammad present on bail is taken into custody and remanded to jail to serve out the sentence.""
2.
 The brief facts of the prosecution case as per FIR lodged on 05.11.2014 at 1450 hours by the complainant SIP Manoomal to the effect that on the said date, he along with ASI Akhtar Hussain and HC Muhammad Asghar during patrolling and prevention of crimes, as per information by the informer, when reached near Noorani Graveyard Sector-48/H, Korangi No.1, Karachi at about 2.00 p.m., they saw one person coming from graveyard in suspicious condition, on the signal by the informer he apprehended him. On inquiry, he disclosed his name as Aqeel Ahmed alias Tiloo son of Din Muhammad, due to non-availability of private person he took his personal search in the presence of Mashirs and recovered one hand grenade wrapped in plastic bag from the pocket of shalwar of accused. He arrested him and prepared memo of arrest and recovery. Brought the accused and case property to the police stdtion and register the FIR.
3.
 It appears from the record that after registration of FIR, the investigation was carried by Inspector Aftab Ali Rind, who after recording the statements of PWs under section 161, Cr.P.C. and after receiving clearance certificate of Rifle Grenade from ASI Mazhar Shah as well as final report from the Bomb Disposal Unit, submitted the charge sheet against the appellant in the Court of law.
4.
 It also appears from the record that in order to establish accusation against the appellant/accused, prosecution had examined in all four witnesses namely SIP Manoomal as PW-1 at Ex.04, he produced copy of roznamcha entry No. 13, memo of arrest and recovery, FIR, being Crime No.425/2014, under Section 4/5 Explosive Substance Act, read with Section 7 ATA, 1997, roznamcha entry regarding his arrival being entry No.15 and memo of inspection place of incident at Ex.04/A to Ex.04/E, respectively, SIP Syed Akhtar Hussain as PW-2 at Ex.05, SIP Muhammad Ayoob as PW-3 at Ex.06, he produced clearance certificate at Ex.06/A, final report and entry No.14 and entry No.16 about his arrival from police station Zaman Town at Ex.06/A to Ex.06/C respectively. Finally the prosecution examined Inspector Aftab Ali Rind as Ex.PW-04 at Ex.07, he produced order of SSP, roznamcha entry Nos.22 and 33, two letters addressed to Bomb Disposal Unit as well as sanction of Home Department at Ex.07/A to Ex.07/F respectively. Counsel for the appellant cross-examined the prosecution witnesses. Thereafter, vide statement as Ex.08, learned Deputy District Public Prosecutor for the State closed the side of prosecution.
5.
 It reveals from the record that the appellant in his statement under section 342, Cr.P.C. at Ex.09 of the R&Ps has denied the case and claim of the prosecution by stating that he is innocent and has been falsely implicated by the police in this case with mala fide intention as nothing was recovered from his possession. He further stated that he was apprehended by the Rangers officials from his house and after filing Constitution Petition No.5621 of 2014 on 05.11.2014 in this Court by his father, he was handed over to police, as such, he was involved in the present case.
6.
 It is argued by the learned counsel for the appellant that appellant is innocent and has falsely been implicated in the present case. There are major contradictions in the evidence of the witnesses examined by the prosecution. Per learned counsel, from the bare reading of the FIR, it reflects that one hand grenade was recovered from the possession of appellant, whereas, in the charge sheet submitted by the I.G. and report of Bomb Disposal Unit reflects that one rifle grenade was recovered from the possession of appellant. Per learned counsel, the Bomb Disposal Unit has issued clearance certificate on 05.11.2014 and final report on 26.11.2014 in respect of the grenade allegedly recovered from the possession of appellant, whereas, alleged incident had taken place on 05.11.2014, which clearly reflects that the clearance certificate and report of Bomb Disposal Unit have been manipulated by the prosecution. Per learned counsel, the appellant was taken away by the Rangers Personnel on 29.10.2014 from his house at about 6.00 a.m., later on after filing constitution petition by the father of appellant, he was handed over to the police, and subsequently, he was booked in the present false case. Per learned counsel, there is violation of section 103, Cr.P.C., as no any independent witness from the locality has been cited as witness of the incident. The entire investigation has been conducted dishonestly, therefore, appellant may be acquitted by giving him benefit of doubt.
7.
 Conversely, learned Assistant Prosecutor General, Sindh has supported the impugned judgment by, stating that the impugned judgment has been passed by the trial Court after considering all the documents and evidence on record. Per learned APO, one hand grenade has been recovered from the possession of accused in presence of Mashirs, who have no enmity with the appellant, therefore, according to him this appeal is liable to be dismissed.
8.
 We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant, learned APG and scanned the available record. Perusal of FIR dated 05.11.2014 and Challan dated 12.11.2014 as well as recovery memo clearly show that one hand grenade was recovered from the appellant. However, the inspection report of Bomb Disposal Unit dated 26.11.2014 shows that SI Ayub Baloch of Bomb Disposal Unit along with his team reached at police station Zaman Town, Karachi and during inspection found one rifle grenade in live condition, which if used with proper technique (fire by rifle) has caused loss of lives and damage to properties. There is big difference between ""hand grenade"" and ""rifle grenade"" and perusal of FIR, challan and inspection report of Bomb Disposal Unit create doubt and suspicion as to nature and description of the alleged recovery from the appellant. There is big contradiction with regard to nature of recovery from the appellant. Therefore, on this ground, false implication of the appellant in this case cannot be ruled out. During the course of arguments, we have specifically asked the question from learned APG to explain the nature of recovery from the appellant with regard to rifle grenade and hand grenade, but he did not reply satisfactory. We noticed that learned trial Court framed the Charge against the appellant for alleged recovery of rifle grenade, which was not the basis of FIR as well as recovery memo and challan sheet. Column No.5 of Challan sheet further shows overwriting in the said column. Therefore, on this ground, the judgment of the trial Court is not sustainable in the eye of law.
9.
 We -have gone through the case of Tariq Pervez v. The State reported as 1995 SCMR 1345, wherein it has been held that if a single circumstance creates reasonable doubt in the prudent mind about the guilt of the accused then he will be entitled to such benefit not as a matter of grace, but as a matter of right. Similar view has also been taken in the case of Muhammad Akram v. The State reported as 2009 SCMR 230.
10.
 It is also the case of the appellant that he was picked up by the Rangers Personnel on 29.10.2014 at about 6.00 a.m. as such, his father and other family members approached to the concerned police station and submitted application, but they refused to receive the same, as such, on 05.11.2014, his father sent application through TCS at police station Zaman Town, Karachi, which was received by him on 05.11.2014 at about 10:56:04 a.m. and also filed Constitution Petition No.5621 of 2014 before this Court. These facts are found supported with the documents available at pages 75, 77 and 77 of the appeal file, but the FIR in the present case has been registered on 05.11.2014 at about 1450 hours much after the receipt of application of appellant's father through TCS to SHO Zaman Town, Karachi. buring the course of arguments, when we confronted with the above factual position to the learned APO, no plausible answer with him.
11.
 We have also perused the evidence and documents on record and have also considered the version of both the parties put forward by them through evidence and found that the version of the appellant seems more plausible and convincing, while the version of the prosecution is totally doubtful.
12.
 For our above stated reasons, we have no hesitation to hold that the prosecution has failed to prove its case against the appellant and learned trial Court did not appreciate the evidence and documents on record properly. Consequently, this appeal is allowed. The impugned Judgment passed by the trial Court is set aside. Resultantly, the appellant is acquitted from the charge. He is in jail, therefore, jail authorities are directed to release the appellant forthwith, if he is not required in any other case.
13.
 This appeal was allowed by our short order after hearing the learned counsel for the parties on 08.06.2017 and these are the reasons thereof.

CH. MUHAMMAD IBRAHIM ZIA, C.J.--- 
The titled appeal by leave of the Court is filed against the judgment of the High Court dated 19.02.2016, whereby the writ petition filed by the appellant, herein, has been dismissed.
2. The appellant, herein, filed a writ petition before the High Court on 22.10.2015 and claimed that vide advertisement dated 03.07.2013 various posts of constables reserve/ranger were advertised. His father is serving as Assistant Director B-17 the Police Department, so he applied for the job against 5% quota reserved for children of Police employees. He passed the test and interview and secured 56-1/2 marks. His name was entered at serial No.58 of the general merit list. It was further claimed that the official respondents instead of inserting the name of petitioner in the merit list of policemen sons and appointing him on regular basis as constable against the reserved quota, appointed him as constable on contract basis vide order dated 23.07.2013, whereas, the private respondents who are lower in merit have been illegally appointed as constables on regular basis. He prayed for direction of his regular appointment. The learned High Court, after necessary proceedings dismissed the writ petition through the impugned judgment.
3. Mr. Fiaz Ahmed Janjua, Advocate, the learned counsel for the appellant after narration of necessary facts submitted that the impugned judgment of learned High Court is result of misconception of law and facts. The authority vide notification dated 16.11.2011 fixed 5% vacancies of constables for children of serving and retired police officers/officials. The father of the appellant is admittedly the police officer/official serving as Assistant Director BPS-17 in the Police Department. In furtherance of the advertised posts, the appellant also appeared in test and interview and obtained 56-1/2 marks, whereas, from the District Muzaffarabad the children of police officers/officials who obtained less marks have been appointed while discriminating the appellant on the ground that his father is serving in the Police Department in ministerial staff, thus, he does not fall within the scope of reserved quota. The appellant feeling aggrieved filed a writ petition which has been decided by the learned single Judge of the High Court through the impugned judgment. The learned single Judge has fell in error of law and facts. The father of the appellant, who is admittedly serving as Assistant Director in the Police Department, falls in definition of police officer/official. The opinion drawn by the learned High Court is against law and facts, therefore, the impugned judgment is not sustainable. Consequently, while accepting this appeal the prayed relief directing for appointment of the appellant according to merit being son of police officer/official, be granted.
4. Conversely, M/s. Raza Ali Khan, Advocate-General and Kokab Al Saba Roohi, Advocate, the learned counsel for the respondents submitted that although the appellant is son of Assistant Director of the Police Department and he also appeared in test and interview and obtained 56-1/2 marks but as his father is not police officer/official, therefore, he cannot be appointed against reserved quota. His father is serving in the ministerial staff which is not included in the scope of prescribed quota, therefore, the impugned judgment is in accordance with law calling for no interference.
5. We have considered the arguments of learned counsel for the parties and examined the record made available. The material facts have been admitted by the respondents in their pleadings. It has also been admitted that the father of appellant, Manzoor Ahmed Awan, is serving in the Police Department in the office of Deputy Inspector General of Police reserve/range as Assistant Director BPS-17. It is further admitted that 5% quota for the children of serving/retired police officers/officials is fixed. The factual proposition of appearing of the appellant in test and interview and obtaining 56-1/2 marks is also admitted. The only reason advanced for not appointing him is that his father is serving in the ministerial staff of the police department, thus, he is not included in the definition of police officer/official. It will be beneficial to reproduce here the relevant part of the notification dated 16.11.2016, which reads as follows:-
""5% of the vacancies of Constable shall be filled in from amongst the children of serving/retried police officers/officials against the said quota as Constable, such recruitment/ appointment shall be made by the appointing authority on the recommendation of Departmental Selection Committee.""
In this notification the words used are ""children of police officers/officials"". There is no distinction of District, range, reserve police or field or ministerial staff. The word used is ""officers/officials"". According to sixth Edition of Black's Law Dictionary the word ""officer"" means ""a person holding the office of trust, command or authority incorporation, government, armed services or other institution or organization"". Same like, the word ""official"" is also defined as ""a person invested with the authority of his office"". In view of clear phraseology of the notification dated 16.11.2016 and dictionary meaning it hardly requires any further deliberation that all the permanent civil servants of police department fall within the scope of ""officer/official"". Our this view also finds support from the provisions of section 2 of the Police Act, 1861 as enforced in the Azad Jammu and Kashmir. The referred section reads as follows:-
""2. Constitution of the force.- The entire police establishment under a Provincial Government for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to be one police-force, and shall be formally enrolled; and shall consist of such number of officers and men, and shall be constituted in such manner, as shall from time to time be ordered by the Provincial Government.""
The above statutory provision clear speaks that the entire police establishment is deemed to be one police-force. As admittedly, the appellant's father is serving in police establishment holding the post of Assistant Director, thus, he falls within the scope of the notification dated 16.11.2016 and is police officer/official. Thus, the authority as well as the High Court has drawn incorrect conclusion.
6. According to the admitted facts, the merit position of the appellant is higher to the candidates appointed from District Muzaffarabad who obtained 55 and 54-1/2 marks, whereas, the appellant obtained 56-1/2 marks. Thus, denial of the right of the petitioner regarding his appointment against 5% quota being son of police official is against law. Therefore, while accepting this appeal and recalling the impugned judgment of the High Court the writ petition filed by the appellant is accepted and the authority is directed to appoint him being son of police official according to his merit position.
This appeal stands accepted with no order as to costs.

 IJAZ ANWAR, J.---
 Through this petition, the petitioner seeks the redressal of his grievances by submitting the following facts:-
1.
 The petitioner is a lawful owner and bona fide purchaser of vehicle bearing Registration No.P-3758, Chasses No.LH 110-0006672 Engine No.2 RZ0007999. The petitioner lost the original Registration book in the year 2008, he duly reported to the local police, which was reduced to a Naqal Mad dated 10.1.2008. He then applied for duplicate copy of the registration to the respondents. It is alleged that before the issuance of duplicate copy dated 13.8.2008, the petitioner found the original Registration and requested for the cancellation of Duplicate copy and that he be allowed to retain the original. The petitioner claimed that due to duplicate registration copy, the vehicle has lost its resale value, and the vehicle once sold was returned to him on the ground that the duplicate copy is creating doubt about the ownership of the vehicle. The request of the petitioner for cancelling the duplicate and permitting him to retain the original registration book was declined to him allegedly in the light of certain instructions contained in office order No.13055/DD (Lit) dated 25.5.2012. The petitioner initially filed W.P.No.2931 of 2014 for the same relief, however, this Court vide judgment and order dated 26.11.2014 treated the writ petition as appeal and sent the same to the department for its decision.
2.
 The appeal of the petitioner was disposed of vide order dated 12.2.2015 on the ground that under Rule 40 of Motor Vehicle Rule, 1969 if the lost original Registration book is found it is liable to cancellation and the duplicate will remain in the field.
3.
 The respondents were put to notice and directed to file parawise comments to the writ petition. They responded to the averment of the writ petition and summarized it in paras-6 and 9. Para-6 and 9 of the comments are reproduced below:-
6.
 In reply to para-6, it is submitted that on 25.2.2012, the Director General Excise and Taxation Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Peshawar vide office order No.1628/Taxation dated 01.09.2008, by directing all the Motor Registering Authorities to consider the recovered/found registration book, as cancelled in light of provisions of Rule 40 of Motor Vehicle Rules, 1969.
9.
 In reply to para-9, it is submitted that the request of petitioner was acceded to, in accordance with law, and direction of this august court was followed and the required appropriate order was passed with regard to original registration of vehicle-in-question, which in purview of Rule 40 of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Motor Vehicles Rules, 1969, is liable to be cancelled and is required to be retained by the office of Motor Registering Authority, Peshawar.
4.
 Arguments heard and record perused.
5.
 In order to appreciate the present controversy, we would like to refer to the relevant provision of Rules that deal with the cases of lost and subsequently found registration book. Rule-38 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Motor Vehicle Rules, 1969 deal with the eventualities of lost Registration book and issuance of Duplicate copy of Registration. Rule-38 ibid is reproduced for convenience:-
38.
 
Loss or Destruction of Certificate of Registration and Certificate of Fitness of a Transport Vehicle:
 (1) If at any time the certificate of registration or the certificate of fitness of a transport vehicle is lost or destroyed, the owner shall forthwith intimate the facts in writing to the registering authority by whom the certificate of registration was issued or by whom the registration mark was assigned under section 30 and shall apply in Form C.R.L.D. Tran. To the said authority for the issue of a duplicate certificate of registration of certificate of fitness.
(2)
 Upon receipt of an application in Form C.R.L.D. Tran Together with a fee of rupees five the registering authority may, after making such enquiries as appear necessary and obtaining particulars of the original certificate of fitness from the Motor Vehicle Examiner or licensed Automobile Workshop by whom it was issued or last renewed, issue a duplicate certificate of registration and certificate of fitness in Forms G and I, respectively, clearly stamped ""Duplicate"" in red ink.
(3)
 No person shall be liable to be convicted of an offence under section 90 if at any time when the certificate is demanded, he has already reported the loss or destruction thereof in accordance with the provisions of this rule and duplicate certificate has not been delivered to him.
6.
 Rule 40 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Motor Vehicle Rules, 1969 deal with the issues when the lost Registration is subsequently found. Rule 40 is reproduced below:-
40.
 
Procedure When a Last Certificate is Subsequently Founded
:- (1) When a duplicate certificate of fitness or certificate of registration has been issued upon representation that the original, has been lost and the original is afterwards found by the holder; the original certificate of fitness or certificate of registration shall be delivered forthwith to the registering authority.
(2)
 Any other person finding a certificate of fitness or certificate of registration shall deliver it to the holder or to the nearest police station.
7.
 Rule 38 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Motor Vehicle Rules, 1969 is quite exhaustive and deal with the procedure how to deal with the issue to provide the duplicate copy of the Registration Book while Rule 40 only provides that where the original Registration Book is found subsequently it shall be returned to the Registering Authority, but it is silent to the fact that which one of the Registration books, original or duplicate will remain in the field.
8.
 Initially vide office order dated 01.9.2008 of the Director General, Excise and Taxation, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa; Peshawar instructions were issued to the following effect. Para-2 is reproduced below:-
""In order to facilitate the general public all Motor Registering Authorities are directed to consider the recovered computerized registration book as original one and cancel and file the duplicate registration book on the basis of FIR/Naqalmad after observing all codal formalities"".
9.
 According to the respondents the letter dated 1.9.2008 has been superseded by office order dated 25.5.2012 of the same authority. Para-2 is reproduced below:-
""In order to facilitate the general public and to stream line the office work all Motor registering authorities are directed to consider the recovered/found registration book as cancelled one as mentioned in rule 40 of Motor Vehicle Rules, 1969. Therefore, the Office Order vide No.1628/ Taxation dated 01.09.2008 issued by this Directorate General as withdrawn with immediate effect"".
10.
 As observed earlier Rule 40 ibid reproduced above only refer to the fact that when the original Registration book is found subsequently, it shall be returned to the Motor Registration Authority but it is silent how to deal with it subsequently. The instructions issued vide office order dated 01.9.2008 of the Registration Authority were quite reasonable and appeal to reasons, however, the subsequent instructions issued vide office order dated 12.5.2012 is against the intension and plain reading of Rule 40 ibid and had given such construction, which it no where suggest.
11.
 It is by now well settled that construction of a statute should be beneficial to the citizen and if there could be two interpretations of a provision of law in a statute, the one which was consistent with reasons should be adopted and the one which lead to absurdity or unreasonableness or patent injustice to a citizen should be avoided, therefore, the construction placed on a provision in a statute, should be such as would suppress the mischief and advance the remedy. Reliance placed on 2016 SCMR 646, 2015 SCMR 1494, PLD 2016 Peshawar 26 and 2013 PCr.LJ 52 (KHC). 
12.
 We having examined the Rules and the construction placed on it through two conflicting letters dated 01.9.2008 and 25.5.2012, and tends to resolve it by upholding the letter dated 01.9.2008 to be more reasonable and beneficial for the citizens as it suppress the mischief and advance the remedy.
13.
 For what has been stated above, we allow this writ petition and direct the respondents to hand over the original Registration book to the petitioner by cancelling the duplicate.
14.
 This writ petition is allowed in the above terms.

 MUHAMMAD NAZIM SALEEM, MEMBER (TECHNICAL-II).--
This judgment disposes off Customs Appeal No.K-820/2016 filed by the Appellant against Order-in-Appeal No.57/2016, dated 26.1.2016 passed by the Collector of Customs (Appeals), Karachi.
2.
 Brief facts of the case as reported in the impugned order-in-appeal are that the appellant imported a consignment of ""High Efficiency Agricultural Irrigation Submersible pump"" from China against GD Machine No.KAPE-HC-64575-13-11-2015 under the HS Code 8413.7010 was declared at the rate of unit value of US$ 15.5000 whereas correct description was ""Deep Well Submersible Pump with Built in Motor made of Stainless Steel Body along with Pump"" assessable at value US$ 30.000.
3.
 On appeals filed by the Appellant against the assessment of goods finalized under Goods Declaration
 bearing No.KAPE-HC-64575-13-11-2015 by the Model Customs Collectorate of Appraisement-East, Custom House, Karachi, the Collector of Customs (Appeals), Karachi vide Order-in-Appeal No.57/2016 dated 26.01.2016, passed the following order:-
 ""I have examined the case record. The appellants are aggrieved on two counts that they were not allowed the concession admissible to them under 5th Schedule to the Customs Act, 1969 and 6th Schedule to the Sales Tax Act, 1990, also their customs value was enhanced. The responding department during the hearing proceedings claimed that the appellants have not established that the goods were for specific use in Agriculture, some of the sizes are for domestic/ house hold use, above all these goods are manufactured locally, therefore the aforesaid concessions are not admissible. The appellants stated that locally manufactured pumps are all made of stainless steel, whereas in imported goods, only outer body is made of steel, however they could not justify this claim with any certification from EDB. Being made of stainless steel, determination of customs value by the respondents is at par with similar goods. I do not find any reason to disturb the assessment. The appeal being without merit fails.""
4.
 Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the above order, the Appellants filed an appeal before this Tribunal on the following grounds:-
A.
 That the value of the impugned goods was enhanced in violation to mandate of subsection (1) of Section 25 of Customs Act, 1969. The transaction value (the prices paid) was not rebutted by the respondents. The transaction value of the impugned goods is correct and the same is the Customs value under the law for payment of duty taxes.
B.
 That the respondents have frustrated, the genuine transaction value, arbitrarily and enhanced the same equal to twice of the transaction value, without disclosing the basis for same. The respondents did not issue notice for enhancement of the value as mandated under Section 25(4) ibid, and acted in violation to Article 10-A of the Constitution vide citation 2008 SCMR 438.
C.
 That the respondents, as per prevailing practice, had been assessing the value of the impugned goods as per the transaction value. Moreover, the respondents have been assessing the same commodity at the transaction value even after the date of assessment made in the impugned G. D.
D.
 That the major, main and typical working parts such as (i) impeller, (ii) diffuser, and (iii) non-return valve of the subject consignment are made of thermoplastic resin are molded produced. Whereas M/s. HMA fabricate the said items from stainless steel, an expensive process, moreover, it has annual manufacturing capacity for production of same capacity pumps equal to 600 pieces.
E.
 That the demand and import, of the same capacity submersible pumps, in Pakistan is more than 500,000 units annually and a manufacturer having 600 pieces annually cannot cater the demand of 500,000 pieces being imported into Pakistan from worldwide sources. The goods under the present case are of China Origin, the price paid in the present case is verifiable through the Embassy of Pakistan in China and the international inspecting agency SGS etc.
F.
 That the respondent under apparent non-bona fides, for undue enrichment, did not opt for independent inquiry for verification of genuineness of the transaction value, which was the customs value under Section 25(1) of the Customs Act, 1969. The act of omission or commission for frustration of the transaction value is unlawful, unconstitutional, without jurisdiction under misuse of authority as to cause injury to the appellant.
G.
 That the appellant has imported the submersible pumps for agricultural purposes, and the same are being used in agricultural usage, including but not limited to watering or dewatering from under soil or soil. The respondent has no authority to deny the usage and purpose of imported goods for apparent non-bona fide for denial of right of exemption available to the appellant.
H.
 That the submersible pumps (falling under HS Code 8413.7040) are equally useable for agricultural purposes, hence qualifies the concessionary rate of customs duty as prescribed under Section 18 (1A) of the Customs Act, 1969 instead of Section 18(l) ibid. The condition of local manufacturing is not applicable, on the subject goods, because the submersible pumps are made of plastic parts, which are not being manufactured locally.
I.
 That the submersible pumps (classifiable under HS Code 8413.7010) under import are exempt from the levy of Sales Tax under the mandate of Section 13 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 at Serial
 No.
 113 of the Sixth Schedule.
 There
 is
 no
 condition
 of local manufacturing, for exemption from payment of sales tax, is prescribed under the Sixth Schedule to the Sales Tax Act, 1990.
 It is, therefore, humbly prayed that kindly pass an order as to:
 
 annul the impugned Order-in-Appeal as well as Assessment Order, passed by the respondents, without determination of facts and laws of the appellant's case, rather the assessment was made on refusal to accept the evidences of past clearances and applicable laws;
 
 directions to the respondent No. 2 to refund the exceeded amount of duty and taxes to the appellant forthwith.
5
 The Respondent Department have submitted their counter-objections/comments in terms of 194-A (4) of the Customs Act, 1969 which are reproduced as under:--
A)
 That the contents of Para (A) are absolutely false and baseless, hence vehemently denied. The fact is that since the value declared was found incorrect and at lower side, accordingly the same was enhanced on the basis of cogent evidences and data and as such the same is neither arbitrarily nor the declared value is actual transaction value in terms of Section 25(1) of the Customs Act, 1969.
B)
 That the contents of Para (B) are also absolutely false and baseless, hence vehemently denied. The fact is that since the value declared by the appellant was crystal clearly been found at lower side and the same cannot be said to be the actual transaction value, accordingly the same was enhanced on the basis of available data and evidences of the actual description of the goods. There is no violation of Section 25(4) of the Customs Act, 1969 and Article 10-A of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 as alleged. The case law reported has no relevancy with the instant case.
C)
 That the contents of Para (C) are repetition of Para 6 above for which reply has been given and as such this Para require no further comments.
D)
 That as regards the contents of Para (D) it is submitted that the appellant has immensely failed at the stage of assessment of goods to provide any substantive cogent documentary evidence to establish that the goods were for specific use in Agriculture, some of the sizes were for domestic/house hold use and as such the same does not justify the description as the appellant tried the appellant in Para under reply.
E)
 That the contents of Para (E) are self explanatory and are not in the knowledge of the answering respondent except that the consignment was imported from China, hence require no comments.
F)
 That the contents of Para (F) are also absolutely false and baseless, hence vehemently denied. The fact is that since the valid and available data and evidences are available for the assessment of the goods, there was no need for conducting any enquiry regarding the transaction value as alleged by the appellant in Para under reply.
G)
 That the contents of Para (G) are repetition of previous Para. It is however reiterated here that the appellant has immensely failed at the stage of assessment of goods to provide any substantive cogent documentary evidence to establish that the goods were for specific use in Agriculture, some of the sizes were for domestic/house hold use and as such the same does not justify the description as the appellant tried the appellant in Para under reply.
H)
 That the contents of Para (H) are repetition of previous Para for which reply has been given, hence this Para require no further comments.
I)
 That the contents of Para (I) are also false and baseless, hence vehemently denied. The fact is that the exemption of Sales Tax was also not available to the appellant. The appellant has incorrectly interpreted the 6th schedule to the Customs Act, 1969.
 It is, therefore humbly prayed that this Honorable Tribunal may graciously dismiss the appeal of the appellant being devoid of merits.
6.
 I have heard both the contesting parties as well as examined the relevant record. As per record, the Appellant has not declared correct description of his goods. He declared the same as High Efficiency Agriculture Irrigation Submersible pump valuing US$ 15/Pieces. However, on examination by the Respondent Department, the same was found to be ""Deep Well Submersible Pump with Built-in Motor made of Stainless Steel Body along with Pump"". The Department assessed value at US$ 30/Piece based on relevant data available with them. With change of description, the value of goods was changed. The said position shows that the Appellant deliberately misdeclared description so that the same could be assessed at lower value i.e. USD 15/piece. On the issue of its use, the Appellant has not rebutted the arguments of the Respondent Department
 that
 some
 of
 the
 Pumps
 have
 size
 and
 specification
 which
 are used for domestic purpose and not for Agriculture. The exemption of customs duty and sales tax in Fifth Schedule to the Customs Act, 1969 and Sixth Schedule to the Sales Tax Act, 1990 respectively is subject to the condition that the goods are used for Agriculture purpose. Furthermore, the goods are also manufactured locally
 as
 per
 C.G.O.
 11
 of 2007.
 The
 preamble
 of
 the
 Fifth
 Schedule
 to Customs Act, 1969 clearly stipulates that the benefit of the Schedule is not available to locally-manufactured goods. Regarding Appellant's contention that the locally-manufactured Pumps, are made of stainless
 steel
 whereas
 in
 imported
 Pumps
 only
 outer
 body
 is
 made
 of steel, I subscribe to the observations of learned Collector of Customs (Appeals); Karachi that the Appellant could not justify this claim with any certification from the Engineering Development Board (EDB).
7.
 In view of above, I do not find any reason, legal or factual to interfere with the impugned order-in-appeal. The same is, therefore, upheld being a lawful Order. The appeal is dismissed for lacking in merit.

 No. 1136/2016
 dated 01.11.2016 passed by the Collector of Customs (Appeals), Karachi.
2.
 Brief facts of the case as reported in the order-in-appeal are that the Appellant imported a consignment and declared to contain ""Cold rolled Steel Sheets and Coils in Secondary Quality"" and filed a Goods Declaration No.I. HC-1006244 dated 15.05.2009 under PCT heading 7209.1610 at unit value of US$ 400/PMT against Letter of Credit (L/C) No. CSLC2572/090037 dated 17.03.2000. Since, there was dispute of value, therefore, the subject goods were assessed provisionally under section 81 of the Customs Act, 1969 at US$ 494/PMT by securing differential amount of duty and taxes to the tune of Rs.1,670,596/- in shape of post dated Cheque No. 1003195 dated 28.05.2012 pending clarification from the Directorate General of Customs Valuation, Karachi. Subsequently, the Directorate General of Customs Valuation, Karachi vide letter C.No. Misc/32/2009-IVA/1255, dated 13.06.2009 directed that Contracts/LCs opened on or after 1st March, 2009 upto 31.05.2009 may be assessed as under:--

The declared value of the Appellant at US$ 400/MT was higher than the value determined by the Directorate General of Customs Valuation, Karachi vide aforesaid letter dated 13.06.2009. It is, however, admitted to the extent that the importer has approached securities section of the Collectorate for release/refund of their security (cheque), however, it was that their secured cheque was got en-cashed manually on 21.06.2012, as the provisional assessment in the instant case was made on 22.05.2009 and the time period of provisional assessment had expired much before the encashment. Subsequently, the Collectorate vide letter dated 29.04.2016 directed the importer to furnish the documents in support of his refund claim proving thereby that incidence of duty and taxes have not been passed on to the end consumer in terms of Section 19-A of the Customs Act, 1969 read with section 33 ibid. Instead of furnishing the same, the importer contested the matter vide letter dated 30.04.2016 that Section 19-A is not applicable in their case as the differential amount of duty and taxes were secured provisionally.
3.
 The adjudicating officer vide Order-in-Original No.11/2016-MCC (East) dated 22.07.2016 held that the charges against the Respondent party is proved. The operative part of the impugned order reads as under:--
 ""I have examined the record of the case. The importer was requested vide to furnish the documents in terms of Section 19-A of the Customs Act, 1969 to prove that the incidence of duties and taxes have not been passed on to the end consumer. But instead of providing the same, they have contested that application of Section 19-A is not relevant in their case. This aspect of the importer cannot be accepted. In this regard, reliance is placed on reported judgments by the Hon'ble Superior Courts i.e. in the case of Messrs Facto Belarus Tractors (2005 PTD 2286), M/s. Pak Suzuki Motor Co. Ltd. (2007 PTC 426) and Messrs Orient Colour Lab. (200 TPCT 1594), where under identical circumstances it was held that party was required to discharge its burden of proof to show that incidence has not been passed on to the end consumer, as required under section 19-A of the Customs Act, 1969. In view of the above, this office is of the considered opinion that in the instant case, the importer has passed on the incidence, of duties and taxes to the end consumer and therefore, the refund claim of the importer is rejected.""
4.
 On appeal filed by the Respondent party against the above order-in-original, the, Collector of Customs (Appeals), Karachi vide Order-in-Appeal No.1136/2016 dated 01.11.2016, passed the following order:--
 ""I have examined the record. The appellants imported CRC secondary quality vide G.D 1006244, dated 15.05.2009 at the declared transaction value of US$ 400/MT, the transaction value was not accepted and provisional determination was made under section 81 of the Customs Act, 1969 with anticipated value @ US$ 494/MT. The differential amount of duty was secured vide cheque No. 1003195. Subsequently Directorate General of Valuation vide ruling dated 13.06.2009 determined value of such goods imported against contracts/LCs between 01.03.2009 to 31.05.2009, as US$ 345/MT. The appellants declared transaction stood validated. The responding department was required to pass a final assessment order as envisaged under section 81(5) of the Act and to return the security. Later, after a time lag of three years, the cheque was encashed by the respondents. Now vide impugned order it has been held that incidence of duty and taxes was passed on by the importer. It is amazing that appellants had been only requesting release of their security furnished vide the above cheque, but the respondents have converted the same into refund claim. There was no payment made either through inadvertence, error or misconstruction. The department did not apply better judgment as how a cheque encashed in 2012 can become part of price of goods imported and sold in 2009. It is also perplexing why a cheque of three years post date was accepted, when the limitation period under section 81 could not go beyond nine months. It is evident that the order has been passed mechanically to cover up the illegal encashment of the impugned cheque. The same is held to be arbitrary and set aside. The appeal is successful.""
5.
 Being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the Order-in-Appeal, the Appellant Department filed the instant appeal before this Tribunal on the grounds, which arc reproduced as under:--
A.
 That the impugned Order-in-Appeal is ab-initio illegal, unjust and with wrong/absurd interpretation of the case, hence, liable to be set aside forthwith.
B.
 That the Order-in-Appeal has been passed without considering the view point of the department hence the same becomes ex-parte in nature. It is submitted that the Respondent No.2 decided the case in favour of the importer merely on the fabricated ground that ""appellant had been only requesting release of their security furnished vide the above cheque, but the respondent have converted the same into refund claim. There was no payment made either through inadvertence, error or misconstruction. The department did not apply better judgment as how a cheque encashed in 2012 can become part of price of goods imported and sold in 2009. It is also perplexing why a cheque of three years postdate was accepted, when the limitation period under the section 81 could not go beyond nine months. It is evident that the order has been passed Mechanically to cover up the illegal encashment of the impugned cheque. The same is held to be arbitrary and set aside"".
C.
 That the Collector (Appeal) failed to consider that under Section 19A of the Customs Act, 1969 no person qualify for refund of duty taxes unless he/she is deemed to pass on the full incident unless he proves contrary Section 19A is reproduced as under:
D.
 That it is specifically mentioned here that in an identical case Bearing No.K-1559/2016, the Honourable Member of Bench-III accepted department's point of view and dismissed the Appeal, wherein importer failed to prove that the incident of duty and taxes had not been passed on to the end consumer.
 In view of the aforesaid submissions, it is respectfully prayed that this Honorable Appellate Tribunal may be pleased to:
i.
 Declare that the impugned order is ab-initio void, illegal and therefore, liable to be set-aside.
ii.
 Declare that the provision of Section 19A is very rightly applicable in the instant case specifically in the light of Superior Courts Orders.
iii.
 Declare that the Order passed by the Adjudicating Officer was correct and in accordance with law.
6.
 The Respondent party has filed their para-wise comments on the Memo. of Appeal filed by the Appellant, which are reproduced as under:-
A.
 That the contents of ground A are vehemently denied.
B.
 That the contents of ground B are mis-stated and simply the Order-in-Appeal has been re-produced as there are no legal grounds which can cover the mis-conduct and arbitrary acts of the appellant.
C.
 That the contracts of ground C are mis-conceived as the facts and laws of the case simply proves that the instant matter was that of release of security cheque under section 81(5) of the Customs Act, 1969, as the same provisional determination was finalized in consequence to the findings by Directorate General of Customs Valuation on the specific reference by the appellant in case of the respondent No.1, and the same declared transaction value was already much higher than the ascertained by competent authority. Hence, there is no question of presumption under section 19A ibid. arise in case of release of seemity cheque.
D.
 That the contents of ground D are false, frivolous and misconceived, the undersigned counsel was also the counsel in appeal referred to in para and the same has no nexus or relation with the issue in hand. The referred appeal was against the refund application against over-payment of duty and taxes inadvertently and through error at the time of filing of G.D. Hence, the findings by this Hon'ble Tribunal in referred case has no similarity of facts and laws of the case in hand.
 It is, therefore, humbly prayed on behalf of replying respondent No. 1 that this Hon'ble Tribunal may kindly dismiss the captioned appeal with an order as to;
1)
 Declare that the presumption under section 19A of the Customs Act, 1969, does not operate in the case of release of security amount under section 81(5) against the final determination by the competent authority, as there was no payment through error, inadvertence or mis-construction;
2)
 Declare that the act of Appellant Collectorate to en-cash a security cheque after a period of more than three (03) months with fabrication is an act culpable crime under the law;
3)
 Direct the appellant to release/refund the amount against security cheque without further delaying tactics.
7.
 I have heard arguments of the learned Counsel of the Appellant as well as the learned Representative for the Respondent Department besides examining the relevant record. My observation is that the Appellant Department has complicated this case perhaps in a drive for ""earning"" revenue. As per Memo of Appeal, a post-dated cheque dated 28.05.2009 amounting to Rs.1,670,596/- was obtained by the Appellant Department from the Respondent party for securing the differential amount of duty and taxes between declared value of US$ 400/M.T and provisional assessment at US$ 494/M.T. Subsequently, the Directorate General of Customs Valuation, Karachi vide letter dated 13.06.2009 confirmed that contracts/Letter of Credits opened on or after 01.03.2009 upto 31.05.2009 may be assessed at US$ 345/M.T. The above cheque was, however, got encashed by the Appellant Department manually on 21.06.2012 as the provisional assessment was done on 22.05.2009 and the time period of provisional assessment had expired much before the encashment. The Memo. of Appeal further states that the ""Collectorate vide letter dated 29.04.2016 requested the importer to furnish the documents in support of his refund claim proving thereby that incidence of duty and taxes have not been passed on to the end consumer in terms of section 19-A read with section 33 of the Customs Act, 1969."" Here, I feel baffled to observe that instead of finalizing the provisional determination within six months, as required under section 81(2) of the Customs Act, 1969, the Appellant Department after three years encashed the post-dated cheque dated 28.05.2009 on 21.06.2012. It was mandatory on the Appellant Department to finalize assessment by 21.11.2009 as the provisional assessment was done on 22.05.2009. Infact, the said final determination could have been done much before expiry of mandatory period of six months as the Director General, Customs Valuation had decided the matter vide letter dated 13.06.2009 by advising the Appellant Department to assess the goods at value US$ 345/M.T. The aforestated position reflects that the assessment could have been finalized within one month of provisional assessment done on 22.05.2009. The Appellant Department's failure to comply with mandatory provision of law is serious omission on their part. More disturbing fact is that instead of finalizing determination and returning the amount secured in the Form of a post-dated cheque to the Respondent party, the Appellant Department encashed the post-dated cheque after about three years in 2012. In my assessment, this is height of non-professionalism and high-handedness on the part of Appellant Department.
8.
 The question of passing of incidence in terms of section 19-A of the Customs Act, 1969 is absolutely irrelevant in this context. It is important to reproduce the said provision of law which is detailed hereunder:--
 ""19A. Presumption that incidence of duty has been passed on to the buyer.---Every person who has paid the customs duty and other levies on any goods under this Act shall, unless the contrary is proved by him, be deemed to have passed on the full incidence of such customs duty and other levies to the buyer as a part of the price of such goods.""
The study of section 19-A clearly shows that it is relevant where the customs duty and other levies have been paid. In the instant case, the customs duty and taxes were not ""paid"" because the Appellant Department got from them a post-dated cheque as a security instrument so that the same could be encashed if the value was determined higher than the declared value. The matter was pending with the Appellant Department to finalize assessment as the goods had been released on provisional assessment. In this case, the Respondent party had declared value of their goods as US$ 400/M.T whereas the Directorate General, Customs Valuation advised the Appellant Department to assess the goods against US$ 345/M.T. It may be mentioned here that the security in the form of post-dated cheque was for the differential amount between US$ 400/M.T and US$ 494/M.T. This was simple preposition, therefore, Appellant Department was required to return/ refund the amount of duty and taxes worked out between US$ 345/M.T and US$ 494/M.T. Here, it is quite significant to point out that as per advice of the Director General, Customs Valuation, Karachi, two amounts were to be returned/ refunded to the Respondent party (i) difference between USD 400/M.T. and USD 494/M.T. (post-dated cheque) and (ii) difference between USD 354/M.T and USD 400/M.T as the Respondent party had deposited duty and taxes as per declared value USD 400/M.T. This process should have been completed within few days/weeks of receiving advice from the Directorate General, Customs Valuation on 13.06.2009. Here, I fully endorse views of the learned Collector of Customs (Appeals), Karachi that ""It is amazing that appellant had been only requesting release of their security furnished vide the above cheque, but the respondents have converted the same into refunds claim. There was no payment made either through inadvertence, error or misconstruction"".
9.
 The position detailed in the preceding para leads me to conclude that the Appellant Department has attended this case not only in an extremely non-professional manner but has deprived the Respondent party of his legitimate money for long (08) years for no fault of theirs which is quite disturbing and detestable. Surprizingly, the Appellant Department had enough guts to file an appeal against the lawful Order of the learned Collector, Customs (Appeal), Karachi who had appreciated this case in its true perspective. The Collector of Customs Appraisement (East), Karachi is directed to immediately return both the amounts, as mentioned in the preceding para, to the respondent party without loss of time. He is further directed to hold an inquiry into this case with a view to fix responsibility for non-professional handling of this case and unjust/ unfair treatment meted out to the respondent party for a long period of eight (08) years and take appropriate action against the delinquent officers of the Collectorate.
10.
 In view of above, the impugned order-in-appeal is upheld as a valid order. The appeal is dismissed being absolutely contrary to law and facts.

27,PERVAIZ IQBAL Versus AKHTAR WAFA,"June 12, 2017",KARACHI HIGH COURT SINDH, Honorable Justice Yousuf Ali Sayeed ,2018 CLCN 20,"JUDGMENT
 YOUSUF ALI SAYEED, J.---
This Second Appeal impugns the Judgment dated 22.10.2015 and Decree dated 02.11.2015 passed by the learned IIIrd Additional District Judge, Karachi (Central) (the ""Appellate Judgment"") in Civil Appeal No. 86 of 2013 (the ""First Appeal""), upholding the Judgment and Decree passed on 29.05.2013 by the learned Vth Senior Civil Judge, Karachi (Central) (the ""Initial Judgment"") in Civil Suit No. 133/2010 (the ""Civil Suit"").
2.
 The dispute inter se the parties, relates to Shop Nos. 4 and 5, situated on the ground floor of a building know as Gulberg Square, situated on Sub-Plot No. ST-4/C/A, Block-16, Federal 'B' Area, Karachi (collectively, the ""Shops""), which the Respondent professes to have purchased from the Appellant in terms of Sale Agreements dated 15.07.1997 and 31.01.1998 (the ""Sale Agreements"") for a sale consideration of Rs.300,000/- and Rs.385,000/- respectively, and claims to have been put in possession thereof by the Appellant upon payment of the entire sale consideration in cash against signed receipts.
3.
 The Civil Suit was filed by the Respondent on 16.02.2010, on the basis of the respective causes of action said to arise from these Sale Agreements, and in terms of the Civil Suit the Respondent alleged having discharged his payment obligations in terms of the Sale Agreements through payments in cash and prayed inter alia for declaration of title and for specific performance as against the Appellant towards execution of sub-lease/sale deeds in respect of the Shops.
4.
 The Appellant disavowed the Sale Agreements and decried the signatures appearing thereon and on the receipts as forgeries. He denied having received any sums from the Respondent or having delivered possession of the Shops to the Respondent on the basis of any such understanding. As per the Appellant, the Respondent was his tenant and had earlier been put in possession of the Shops in that capacity pursuant to Tenancy Agreements dated 01.06.1996 and 24.01.1998. It was submitted that the Respondent had fabricated the Sale Agreements for fraudulently annexing the Shops, and that he had instituted the Civil Suit seeking specific performance accordingly.
5.
 From the pleadings of the parties in the Civil Suit, the following issues were framed:
(i)
 Whether suit is not maintainable under the law?
(ii)
 Whether Defendant had executed sale agreement dated 15.7.1997 and 31.1.1998 in favour of the Plaintiff in respect of shops/property against total consideration of Rs.675000/-
(iii)
 Whether Plaintiff has paid total sale consideration to the Defendant?
(iv)
 Whether Plaintiff was originally inducted by Defendant as tenant?
(v)
 Whether Plaintiff is entitled for the relief claimed?
(vi)
 What should be the decree?
6.
 In terms of the Initial Judgment, the finding in respect of Issues 2, 3 and 5 was returned in the affirmative and in respect of Issues 1 and 4 in the negative, all of which supported the case of the Respondent, which was then upheld in the First Appeal as per the Appellate Judgment.
7.
 Learned counsel for the Appellant submitted that the Courts below have materially erred in failing to appreciate that (a) that the disputed Sale Agreements were quite evidently dubious as the signatures said to be those of the Appellant were clearly shaky, (b) the disputed Sale Agreements remained unproven as per the requirement of law due to the fact that only one of the attesting witnesses was produced to give evidence, (c) that undue reliance was placed on the report of a handwriting expert without such report being exhibited in evidence and/or the expert being summoned, and (d) that, even otherwise, the Civil Suit, having been filed on 16.02.2010, was not maintainable in as much as the same was clearly barred by limitation as per Article 113 of the Limitation Act 1908, which prescribes three years' period of limitation for a suit for specific performance and the time begins to run from ""the date fixed for the performance, or if no such date is fixed, when the plaintiff has notice that performance is refused"".
8.
 He pointed out that the signatures on the Sale Agreements alleged to those of the Appellant visibly differed from the signatures appearing on the Tenancy Agreements, and it was evident that the same had been penned by a shaky hand. He submitted that as factum of signature was denied and the genuineness of the Sale Agreements was central to the Respondent's claim in the Civil Suit and thus formed the crux of the dispute, the onus lay on the Respondent to discharge the burden of proof by establishing that the signatures appearing thereon were those of the Plaintiff, for which purpose the persons who were shown as witnesses to the Sale Agreements were required to be examined on oath and presented for cross-examination, as prescribed by Article 79 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. He placed reliance on single-bench judgments of this Court in the cases reported as Zafar lqbal v. Sher Muhammad and 3 others 2003 YLR 673 and Maqsood Ali Khan v. M. Tehseen Khan 2003 YLR 1866. He submitted that, nonetheless, only one of the witnesses to the impugned Sale Agreements, namely Muhammad Shahzad, who is the brother-in-law of the Respondent, was called as a witness, whereas the other person shown as a witness, namely Laiq Ahmed, was never examined albeit the Respondent admitting under cross-examination that he was the occupant of the adjacent shop.
9.
 He further submitted that in ignoring the mandate of Article 79, the learned SCJ placed undue reliance on the report of a handwriting expert, albeit that the report had not been exhibited in evidence and its author had not been called to depose as an expert witness and thus be subject to cross-examination, due to which such report was of no evidentiary value. He placed reliance on the judgments of the Honourable Supreme Court in the cases reported as Allah Dino and 2 others v. Mohammad Umar and 2 others 1974 SCMR 411 and Hazara and others v. Muhammad Yar and others 2011 SCMR 758. He also pointed out that the Appellant had filed objections to the report, contending that the expert had been won over by the Respondent.
10.
 Without prejudice to his contention that the Sale Agreement remained unproven as per the mandate of law, learned counsel further submitted that the Civil Suit was even otherwise barred by limitation as the same had been filed on 16.02.2010, over 12 to 13 years after the date of the Sale Agreements, which dated back to 1997 and 1998, whereas Article 113 of Limitation Act, 1908, provided 3-years as the period of limitation for filing a suit for specific performance. He further contended that the date of refusal started from the date of first notice dated 02.05.2001, therefore, the Civil Suit was barred, having been filed after delay of about 9 years. He relied upon cases reported as Bomanshaw Burjorji Gazdar v. Mst. Mumtaz Begum and others 1985 SCMR 554, Zafar Iqbal's case (Supra) and Haji Muhammad Yaqoob through Legal Heirs v. Shah Nawaz 1998 CLC 21.
11.
 With reference to the Initial Judgment as well as the Appellate Judgment, learned counsel contended that the point of limitation had evidently been wrongly decided at both the fora below, and, in this regard, pointed out that the successive legal notices said to have been issued on behalf of the Respondent were erroneously deemed to afford a fresh cause of action and the period of limitation under Article 113 of the Limitation Act was reckoned from the date of the last such notice (i.e. 09.01.2010). He submitted that, even otherwise, no notices had even been received by the Appellant, let alone replied or acknowledged as correct, and the mere factum of issuance of such notices, even if accepted for the sake of argument, could not of itself extend the alleged cause of action for filing of the Civil Suit. He placed reliance on the judgment of the Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case reported as Messrs Anwar Textile Mills Limited v. Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited and others 2013 SCMR 1570 to show that the question of limitation remained open within the scope of a Second Appeal.
12.
 On the other hand, learned counsel for the Respondent submitted that the proceedings in the Civil Suit and the First Appeal were proper in all respects and satisfied the mandate of the law. He submitted that the evidence tendered by one of the witness to the Sale Agreements in support of the Respondent's claim in respect of the Shops coupled with the handwriting expert's report was sufficient to prove the execution and hence the authenticity of the Sale Agreements. He placed reliance on a judgment of the honourable Supreme Court reported as Ghulam Rasool and others v. Akbar Ali and others 2011 SCMR 794, as well as single bench judgments of this Court reported as Muhammad Umer and another v. The State PLD 1968 Karachi 875 and of the erstwhile Dacca High Court reported as Majarullah Mondal and others v. Matiur Rahman and others PLD 1968 Dacca 167. Furthermore, he defended the findings on the point of limitation whilst restating the very rationale applied by the Courts below.
13.
 I have examined the Initial Judgment and Appellate Judgment and considered the arguments advanced at the bar. The basis of the Respondent's claim in terms of the Civil Suit were the Sale Agreements, the execution of which had been denied by the Appellant. As such, the onus was on the Respondent to prove the same. During the course of proceedings at first instance, the Sale Agreements as well as the Tenancy Agreements placed on record by the Appellant were sent to the handwriting expert along with specimen signatures of the parties. In his report, the handwriting expert opined that the set of signatures on the Sale Agreements as well as the set of signatures on the Tenancy Agreements were similar to the specimen signatures of the Appellant. Both the courts below relied upon the expert's report despite objections raised. In defending this methodology, learned counsel for the Respondent referred to Muhammad Umer's case (supra) and Majarullah Mondal's case (Supra) in an endeavor to show that the comparison of a disputed signature with signature that are admitted is a legal mode of determining the genuineness thereof and that if, after carefully examining the disputed and admitted writings and after scrutinising the evidence of a handwriting expert, the Court is fully convinced that as to genuineness of the writing on a disputed document, there is no bar to the Court proceeding to record a finding on such a basis.
14.
 Be that as it may, from a reading of the aforementioned Judgments it is apparent that the endorsement of the legality of such an approach was circumscribed with reference to the inherent dangers of basing a decision entirely on such a comparison and from a reading of the said Judgments it appears that whilst such approach may have been considered legally permissible, it was not considered to be desirable as a matter of general practice. The learned single Judge in Majarullah Mondal's case (Supra) specifically noted that ""In certain circumstances it is unsatisfactory and dangerous to base a decision on the correct determination of the genuineness of a handwriting or a signature"", and in Muhammad Umer's case (Supra), which was a case pertaining to a criminal conviction, it was observed as follows:
""I am also of the view, if I may say so respectfully, that this evidence needs very careful examination and should also generally be supported by corroboration to be the basis of conviction in a criminal case, I have seen handwriting experts appearing on opposite sides and giving diametrically opposite opinions with regard to the same writing and supporting it with equal zeal, and force. It is for this reason that their opinion have often been described as that of a partisan or biased witness. But having said this I must add that if after carefully examining the disputed and admitted writings and after scrutinising the evidence of handwriting expert, the Court is fully convinced that the writing of the disputed documents is of the same person who wrote the admitted ones there is no bar in law to base a conviction upon such a finding.""
As such, it is apparent that whilst the evidence of a handwriting expert has its own evidentiary value, the same cannot be regarded as gospel and the Court is required to apply its mind to the controversy at hand in each case so as to properly examine and carefully consider the expert evidence, along with such corroborative evidence as may be available, so as to be convinced.
15.
 In the instant case, such caution does not appear to have been exercised, as the Sale Agreement ascribed to the Appellant visibly appears to lack a firm hand and perusal of these signatures in juxtaposition with the set of signatures on the Tenancy Agreements shows a marked and clearly discernible variation between the two sets of documents to an extent that casts an appreciable element of doubt as to the experts finding that both sets correspond with the specimen signatures of the Appellant, as it could logically only have been one or the other.
16.
 Even otherwise, it merits consideration that whilst the opinion of an expert may be of relevance as per Article 59 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, that is not to say that a report prepared by an expert would be admissible without examination of the said expert. The Honorable Supreme Court in the Allah Dino's case (Supra) held as under:--
""Mr. A.S. Pirzada, learned counsel for the appellants has submitted that this evidence is of no use because the Expert has not been examined in Court. This objection of the learned counsel appears to be well founded. I would, therefore, not take into consideration the report of the Handwriting Expert.""
On the basis of and with reference to the aforesaid principle, the apex Court held in Hazara's case (Supra) that the report of an expert as regards a thumb impression was of no help to the party seeking to rely thereon due to the non-appearance of the expert in the witness box.
17.
 Furthermore, as per the mandate of Article 79 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, the proper course to have been followed was for both witnesses to the Sale Agreements to have been produced so as to confirm the factum of execution in their presence and thus dispel the contention of the Appellant that the signatures appearing thereon were not his. The onus in this respect, as already observed, was upon the Respondent. However, this was not discharged, as only one of the witnesses was produced, and he too was admittedly a relative of the Respondent. Whilst considering this matter in the Initial Judgment it was observed by the learned civil Judge that the ""Learned counsel for plaintiff contended that the other marginal witness was not in his contact therefore, the plaintiff was not in a position to produce him in Court"". However, when this aspect is examined, it emerges that under cross-examination the Respondent had conceded that Laiq Ahmed, the witness who was not produced, was the occupant of the adjoining shop. As such, there was apparently no valid reason for him not to have been produced as per the mandatory requirement of law. Nonetheless, the learned civil Judge went on to hold that the circumstantial evidence and the expert's report were sufficient to prove the execution of the Sale Agreements. Having considered the matter, I am with utmost respect unable to agree with this finding. As previously discussed, the experts report itself lacked evidentiary value, and, if anything, the so called circumstantial evidence only served to highlight unbridged gaps in the version of the Respondent. Accordingly, I am of the opinion that the execution of the Sale Agreements was not satisfactorily proven as per the mandate of law, due to which the judgments and decrees passed by both the Courts below cannot be maintained, as per the judgment of the honourable Supreme Court reported as Rafaqat Ali and others v. Mt. Jamshed Bibi and others 2007 SCMR 1076, and the single-bench Judgments of this Court in Maqsood Ali Khan's case (Supra) as well as Zafar Iqbal's case (Supra).
18.
 Turning now to the point of limitation, from a plain reading of Article 113 it is apparent that the same conceives two situations, the first being where the date for performance is specified in the agreement, and the other where no such date is specified. Under the first part, time begins to run from the date fixed for the performance, whereas, under the second part, where no such is fixed, time begins to run from the date when the plaintiff has notice performance of the agreement is refused. Whilst, correctly observing that the Sale Agreements do not fix a specific date for performance and thus proceeding in terms of the second part, the Courts below then came to the conclusion that the Civil Suit filed by the Respondent was within time as it had been instituted in period of three years from the date of the legal notice dated 09.01.2010 said to have been addressed by him to the Appellant, which was determined in terms of the Initial Judgment and the Appellate Judgment to be the date on which the Respondent had sufficient notice that performance of the Sale Agreements was being refused. It is this aspect and the reasoning that prevailed with the Court at first instance and the first appellate Court that requires examination.
19.
 In this regard, it has to be considered that as per the Respondent, a legal notice was addressed to the Appellant on 02.05.2001 to no avail, and a reminder was then sent though counsel on 26.04.2004, but no reply was received. It is then said that on a publication being effected in a newspaper by the purchaser of some other shop in the same project in which the Shops are situated, the Respondent addressed a letter to the Appellant on 27.04.2007, in response to which the Appellant is said to assured the Respondent as to completion of performance during the first week of January 2010. It is said that upon the failure of the Appellant to fulfil such commitment, the counsel of the Respondent addressed yet another legal notice dated 09.01.2010 to the Appellant, which again remained unreplied. It is this notice that has been treated by the Court below as the date of commencement of the period of limitation under Article 113.
20.
 It has to be considered that having denied the execution of the Sale Agreements, the Appellant had also denied knowledge of the notices said to have been addressed by the Respondent, and, indeed, no proof of despatch/receipt was provided by the Respondent and no correspondence was placed on record to indicate any acknowledgment on the part of the Appellant as to the existence of the Sale Agreements or acceptance of any obligation in respect of the Shops. As such, there is no foundation to support the finding of a continuing series of causes of action. In the case of Bomanshaw Burjorji Gazdar (Supra) a notice calling upon a part to perform a contract, when remaining unacknowledged, was considered by the honourable Supreme Court as sufficient to put the sender on notice that performance was being refused. Furthermore, in Zafar Iqbal's case (Supra), the conduct of a party in failing to perform the agreement upon being approached to do so was considered to constitute sufficient notice to the counter-party seeking performance that the same was being refused. As per the reported facts, the latter case appears to have been the mirror image of the matter at hand as regards the aspect of limitation, in as much as the suit in that case had been held to be barred under Article 113, and such finding had been upheld in appeal. In proceedings in revision under section 115, C.P.C. it was contended that as no specific date had been prescribed for performance, the case fell under the second part of Article 113, and as performance had not been specifically refused and the applicant had been kept on hopes therefore the limitation period did not start running. It is in this context that the learned single Judge made the aforementioned observation, which in my view would be squarely applicable as regards the case set up by the Respondent in the Civil Suit. Thus, in my view, under the given circumstances and in light of the aforementioned precedents, the period of limitation as per Article 113 began to run as against the Respondent from date of the legal notice dated 02.05.2001 and the Civil Suit was thus clearly barred by limitation.
21.
 In view of the foregoing, it is evident that judgments of the Courts below cannot be sustained and this Second Appeal thus succeeds with the result that the Appellate Judgment and Initial Judgment are set aside, and consequently any benefit derived by the Respondent thereunder in respect of title to the Shops is also set aside and is to be reverted/restored to the Appellant.
22.
 This Second Appeal is allowed in the above terms.
ZC/P-5/Sindh
 Appeal allowed."
28,AMEER JAN Versus PROJECT MANAGER GRC,"June 12, 2017",PESHAWAR HIGH COURT, Honorable Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan ,2018 CLC 1465,"JUDGMENT
 MOHAMMAD IBRAHIM KHAN, J.---
Ameer Jan and 17 others Petitioners herein, are imploring the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court setting their prayer as follows:-
""It is, therefore, humbly prayed that (on) acceptance of this writ petition, the Respondents may please be graciously directed to install electric poles and lay transmission line in village common land instead of thickly populated area or across the river in barren area; they may also be graciously refrain from carrying out any sort of work in our properties without acquisition process and compensation according to the market value as per law.
Any other relief which this august Court deems fit and appropriate may also be graciously granted.
2.
 Brief but necessary facts as deciphered from the record are that Petitioners claimed to be owners in possession of properties bearing Khasra Nos. 1026, 1028, 1031, 1193, 1215, 1216, 1234, 1237 and 1251 situated within the local limits of Satal Ghari Tehsil Behrain District Swat. The Sarhad Hydal Development Organization (SHYDO) ""the Employer"" had executed a contrast with SINOTEC-SHPE-GRS ""the Contractor"" on 11.04.2012, wherein the latter was bound to carry-out certain assigned works i.e. designing, manufacturing, testing, delivering, installing, procurement and construction of Daral Khwar Hydro Power Project. Thereafter, the Provincial Government acquired the land through PHYDO Department by way of mutation Nos. 1484 and 312 dated 30.05.2012 for the construction of power house, access road and site for water storage. The compensation in lieu of acquired land has been distributed amongst land affectees.
3.
 In the meanwhile, the Respondents Nos.1 to 5 have stated installation of electric poles and they are lying transmission lines from Power House Daral Khwar Hydro Power Project to Grid Station Madyan. The said Power House would generate power of 36 Megawatt. Likewise the power house currently under construction at Matiltan would generate electricity up to 84 Megawatt and power/energy of both these power houses would run through the proposed transmission lines. With adding information that each electric pole would be installed over an area of 60 x 60 sqt. i.e. 13.2 marlas. However, the Provincial Government has neither acquired the properties of the Petitioners nor any compensation has been paid to them. In the meanwhile, the Respondents Nos.1 to 8 have diverted the transmission line due to political pressure at some places and instead of following straight route they are installing the transmission lines in zigzag path. Besides the Respondents have malafidely left out the village common land (""Shamilat"") and are carrying-out installation of transmission line in the properties of the Petitioners. The Petitioners have also raised concern that the Respondents instead of installing transmission lines across the river, which is obviously less populated area, rather carry-out the said work in the built up area without advancing any plausible reason in this regard. In this behalf, the Petitioners have moved several applications to the concerned quarter i.e. Respondent No. 2 for redressal of their grievances, but of no avail, hence, the present writ petition has been preferred inter-alia on the grounds mentioned from (a) to (e).
4.
 Comments were called from the Respondents Nos.1 and 2, who submitted accordingly, wherein it has been mentioned that the design, procurement and construction of Daral Khwar Hydropower Project (HPP) has been undertaken by the Government of Pakhtunkhwa Energy Development Organization (PEDO)/Energy and Power Department Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. A consortium comprising International and National Contractors has been selected for the construction of the project. With adding information that Daral Khwar HPP is a project of National interest which is in the final stage of its completion. This project will not only be a great source of energy to the National Grid but it will also generate revenue for the local community in shape of 10% Royalty. It has been further enumerated therein that the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa through PEDO/E&P Department has acquired the land with the help of Local Administration as per spirit of the Land Acquisition Act. According to law, no permanent Land Acquisition is required for transmission of lines as very small pieces of lands are required for this purpose, however compensation for standing crops and trees, if any, in the land at the foundations of towers is paid and for this purpose with the coordination of Local Administration at Behrain the project management PEDO and Project consultants have submitted assessment compensation report to the tune of Rs.33,00,000/-. The Respondents further submitted that in the interest of the locals and to minimize the effects on the local area, the transmission line from Gorkin-Matiltan HPP Will be terminated in Daral Khwar HPP Power House at Behrain and both the projects will be carried through single transmission line from Behrain to Madyan Grid Station.
5.
 Having heard arguments of learned counsel for the parties, available record with their valuable assistance gone through.
6.
 Learned counsel for the Petitioners relied on (2007 MLD 1998) ""Kadir Baksh v. Chairman WAPDA and others"", PLD 1994 Supreme Court 639 ""Mst. Shehla Zia and others v. WAPDA, besides also submitted written arguments for assistance of the Court and prayed for the acceptance of the present writ petition as valuable rights of his clients i.e. Petitioners are at stake by way of compensation of their lands. Inversely learned counsel for the Respondents referred to (PLD 1991 Supreme Court 715) ""Malik Haji Nazar Muhammad and another v. WAPDA and another"", (PLD 2002 Lahore 28), ""Hakim Ali v. Member Power WAPDA and others"" (PLD 1993 Lahore 237) ""Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority v. Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission Employees Cooperative Housing Society and others"", (PLD 1992 Peshawar 76) Umer Gul v. Malik Abdul Manan"" and (2013 SCMR 1752) Contempt of Court proceedings against Chief Secretary Sindh and others"" and prayed for utter dismissal of the petition being shorn of merits.
7.
 The learned counsel for the Petitioners has shared his valuable knowledge in view of the dictums highlighted earlier. Under the grounds taken in the memo. of his Petition having been moved an application before the Respondent No.13 on 29.9.2016 to the effect that the Petitioners are owners of the survey numbers mentioned therein. They have prayed for non-installation of the electric poles in their owned and possessed lands instead a proposal was given to carry-out the installation in the Shamilati land, which was under the scheduled PC-1, in this way the Petitioner will not suffer extensive damage in respect of their owned and possessed properties. If otherwise their prayer is not accorded then as an alternate remedy they are entitled to compensation in shape of award of acquisition of their lands under the Land Acquisition Act through Local Administration and in this behalf the Assistant Commissioner Behrain shall hold a thorough inquiry.
8.
 The petition under narration of facts at Serials 8 and 9 has paramount importance, it seems otherwise while the Respondents have carried-out their 95% work of installation of towers for the purpose of supply then the given prayer of the Petitioners with regard to restraining the Respondents from installation of transmission lines will have absolutely no force. The Respondents have spent huge finances in billions but at least in return the Petitioners may be compensated in terms of a prayer for award for the market value of their lands if at all such lands are directly affected from installation of the towers that is why great emphasis has been made on facts at Serials 8 and 9 the Petition. Para No. 8 speaks of ""that the Respondents are about to install electric poles on the valuable properties of the Petitioners without being acquired or compensated the land affectees."" Likely Para No. 9 reveals ""that the Respondents may graciously be restrained from carrying out illegal and unlawful work without acquisition and compensation on the following grounds.""
9.
 As far as the earlier prayer for consideration upraising of towers in the Shamilati lands or across the river, it is manifestly clear that this period within structure is over as there are only few poles/towers which are to be hoisted so to carry out the entire work for smooth supply and running of power in lines. While dealing with the prayer for compensation it is valid for this purpose in accordance with the comments furnished an amount of Rs. 33,00,000/- has already been reserved and even under the finance program further amount can be arranged if the acquisition process is carried-out and values of the properties that are to be affected the award is determined. The Pukhtunkhwa (Energy) Development Organization Act, 1993 cast upon this organization to have process and obligations of licensee under Electricity Act, 1910 as per section 14 of the ibid Act;-
""Organization to have powers and obligations of licensee under Electricity Act, 1910.- - - The organization shall, for the purposes of the, Electricity Act, 1910, be deemed to be a licensee and shall have the powers and discharge all the obligations of a licensee under the said Act;
Provided that nothing in sections 3 to 11, subsections (2) and (3) of section 21 and sections 22, 23 and 27 of the said Act, or in clauses I to XII of the Schedule to the said Act, relating to the duties and obligations of a licensee shall apply to the Organization.""
 Section 15 pertains to Powers regarding certain matters. Its subsection (2) clause (b) empowers the organization;-
 a .
b. Acquire by purchase, lease, exchange or otherwise and dispose of by sale, lease, exchange or otherwise, [any immovable property or any interest in such property];
 The attached subsection (3) provides mode and manners Under Land Acquisition Act, 1894 it says,-
""The acquisition of any land or any interest in land for the Organization under this section, or of any scheme under this Act, shall be deemed to 'be an acquisition for a public purpose within the meaning of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, and the provisions of the said Act shall apply to all such proceedings.""
 This Act of the year i.e. The Pakhtunkhwa [Energy] Development Organization Act, 1993 highlights section 16 subsection 2(b) as,-
""Right of entry. ------------
Provided that when the affected land does not vest in the Organization the power conferred by this subsection shall be exercised in such manner as to cause least damage to the rights of the owner thereof.""
 10.
 In order to initiate the process for determination of the price of lands coming under the elevation of towers owned by the affectees/Petitioners there may be an earlier acquisition process for a definite award strictly in terms of the market rate. It is pertinent to mention here that the Interim Relief granting order handed down by this Court on 16.01.2017 is hereby recalled.
11.
 In such setting of the terms, this writ petition is disposed of accordingly.
MH/64/P
 Order accordingly."
29,MUHAMMAD AFZAL Versus JUDGE FAMILY COURT,"June 12, 2017",LAHORE HIGH COURT LAHORE, Honorable Justice Jawad Hassan ,2018 CLC 801,"JUDGMENT
 JAWAD HASSAN, J.---
 Through this Constitutional Petition, the Petitioner has called in question orders dated 19.03.2016 and 22.11.2016 passed by the learned Executing Court, Gujranwala.
2.
 Facts briefly for the disposal of this Constitutional Petition are that as a consequence of suit for maintenance and recovery of dowry articles Judgment and Decree dated 16.05.2013 (the ""Judgment and Decree"") was passed by Judge Family Court, Gujranwala, whereby the Respondent No.2, was not held entitled to get maintenance allowance beside this she was entitled to get dowry articles or in the alternate value of Rs.1,50,000/-. The said Judgment and Decree was assailed by the Respondent No.2, which was partially allowed vide judgment dated 18.03.2015 (the ""Appellate Judgment"") with modification whereby she was deserved entitled to get maintenance allowance at the rate of Rs.4000/- per month subject to performance of her matrimonial obligations and not otherwise. The said judgment and decree was not further assailed before the higher forum. However, during pendency of execution proceedings, the learned Executing Court vide order dated 19.03.2016 observed that since Talaq has been effected on 30.11.2015, therefore, judgment debtor/Petitioner is under legal obligation to pay maintenance till 30.11.2015. Subsequently, the learned Executing Court on 2.11.2016 passed the order, whereby the Respondent No.2 was entitled to recover her arrears of maintenance allowance from the period of 16.05.2013 to 30.11.2015 (the ""Impugned Orders""), which is beyond the Judgment and Decree. Hence this petition.
3.
 Learned counsel for the Petitioner has argued that Impugned Orders have been passed by learned Executing Court in an arbitrary manner as the Executing Court had no jurisdiction to go beyond the decree. He has further argued that Executing Court has no jurisdiction to modify the Judgment and Decree. Lastly, he prayed for setting aside of the said Impugned Orders.
4.
 On the other hand counsel for the Respondent No.2 has supported the Impugned Orders and contended that Impugned Orders passed by the learned Executing Court are inline with the Appellate Judgment passed by the learned Additional District Judge, therefore, no exception can be taken to it. Lastly, he prayed for dismissal of the writ petition.
5.
 Arguments heard and record perused.
6.
 It is reflected from perusal of record that pivotal question to be determined by this Court is whether the learned Executing Court, Gujranwala was justified to pass an order in execution proceedings, which was not passed in Judgment and Decree out of which execution proceedings were arisen. In order to resolve this issue, it is pertinent to mention and reproduce the Appellate Judgment of the learned Additional District Judge, Gujranwala, the relevant extract whereof is reproduced hereunder:-
""15.
 So far as maintenance allowance of the appellant is concerned, it is submitted that wife is entitled to get maintenance only when she is performing the matrimonial obligations but in the present case, she is not performing the matrimonial obligations because admittedly, criminal litigation is pending between the parties, even otherwise at the time of pre-trial reconciliation proceedings, she made statement before the court that she does not want to reconcile with the respondent, even during the cross-examination, she refused to live with the respondent, therefore, learned trial court rightly disentitled her from past maintenance allowance. However, as marriage inter se the spouses is still intact and she is still legal wedded wife of the respondent, therefore, she deserves maintenance allowance at the rate of Rs.4000/- per month subject to perform her matrimonial obligations not otherwise.""
7.
 It is evident from the record that during the execution proceedings, the Executing Court went beyond its jurisdiction and passed the Impugned Orders not warranted by law. The relevant extract from the said order is reproduced hereunder:-
""File has been perused. Interim order dated 19.03.2016 reveals that divorce has been effected on 30.11.2015 and my learned predecessor court has ordered the payment of decretal amount under the ambit of conditional maintenance allowance holder. Same order has not been challenged and attained finality. In the larger interest of justice, decree holder is held entitled to recover her arrears of maintenance allowance from the period of 16.05.2013 to 30.11.2013. Judgment debtor is bound to pay the arrears of monthly maintenance allowance to decree holder.""
8.
 From the perusal of above order it reveals that said order was a conditional order and could only be enforced and executed if the condition imposed in the said order was fulfilled, but from the perusal of above said order it transpires that the Respondent No.2 categorically denied to rehabilitate with the Petitioner and to perform her matrimonial obligations, therefore, passing of said order in such circumstances was not justified, perverse and contrary to the dictates of Apex Courts. So far as Executing Court whose orders are impugned in this Court is concerned, it also acted beyond its jurisdiction and passed the orders in jurisdiction not vested in it. The Executing Court cannot go beyond the decree and it has to execute the decree in the manner in which the decree has been passed. Reliance in this respect is placed upon Sardar Ahmed Yar Khan Jogezai and 2 others v. Province of Balochistan through Secretary, C&W Department (2004 SCMR 122), wherein it has been held as under:-
""Executing Court at the time of execution of the decree, modified the decree by changing the rate of interest specified in the decree. Substitution of amendment could not have been made by the Executing Court as the same amounted to attempt to frustrate the object of the judgment and decree which had already attained finality. Such order passed by the Executing Court was arbitrary, capricious and coram non judice. Executing Court could not be go behind the decree. When decree passed attained finality, it had got to be executed even if it was erroneously passed. Executing Court could not rectify any mistake in decree which would tantamount to going behind the decree.""
Although the Petitioner had not challenged the Appellate Judgment of Additional District Judge, Gujranwala, but it does not give power to the Executing Court to pass an order in the executing proceedings not warranted by law, which go beyond the decree.
9.
 In view of the above and by relying on the Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in `Ahmad Yar Khan Jogezai' case supra, this petition is allowed and Impugned Orders are set aside and learned Executing Court is directed to implement the Appellate Judgment of the learned Additional District Judge in its true sense and perspective manner.

 WAQAR AHMAD SETH, J.---
On his failure to obtain bail from the learned Judge Anti Terrorism Court, Peshawar vide order dated 08.04.2017, petitioner Muhammad Khalid who is accused in case FIR No. 368 dated 08.07.2014, under sections 302, 324, 148, 149, P.P.C., Police Station Sarband, Peshawar, has come to this Court for his release on bail.
2.
 Arguments of learned counsel for the parties heard and available record perused with their able assistance.
3.
 It appears from the record available on file that in this case the occurrence took place on 08.07.2014 at 2140 hours, while the report has been lodged on the same date at 2340 hours. Feroz Shah is the complainant of present case, and he has charged the unknown culprits initially, but, later on vide his statement recorded on 16.03.2017 under section 164, Cr.P.C. he nominated the accused/petitioner Muhammad Khalid for the murder of Faisal and Hayat Muhammad, however, in the FIR affective role of firing has been attributed to unknown persons. Here this aspect of the case cannot be overruled that the occurrence took place on 08.07.2014, while complainant charged the accused/ petitioner in his statement recorded on 05.01.2015 which is after lapse of 05 months and 27 days. Similarly other injured persons also charged the accused/ petitioner in their statement recorded on 16.03.2017 and 'that too' after long considerable delay of 02-Years, 08 Months and 08-days, on the basis of developed false story. 
4. 
 Moreover, in the present case the 4 occurrence took place on 08.07.2014 at 2140 hours, whereas, the report has been lodged on the same date at 2340 hours. On the face of it there is considerable delay of two hours in lodging the FIR by the respondent/complainant who was present with the deceased at the time of ( ).
5.
 From the perusal of record it reveals that in the FIR no one was charged by name. No doubt in the present incident five persons sustained injuries and two were died, but, even then the injury on their persons do not commensurate with the number of accused who as per version of the prosecution were armed with Kalashnikovs and that on seeing them they all started indiscriminate firing with intention to kill them and which fact alone takes their case to that of further enquiry, because except these statements there is nothing on record to connect him with the crime. Neither recovery/discovery was affected from the accused/petitioner nor he confessed his guilt before competent authority.
6.
 In view of the facts and circumstances of the case, there is scope of further inquiry into the guilt of the accused/petitioner. Therefore bail petition in hand is accepted and the accused/ petitioner is admitted to bail provided that he furnishes bail bonds to the tune of Rs. 5,00,000/- with two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the learned trial Court.
7.
 Above were the reasons of short order of even date.

31,ZAMEER Versus State,"June 9, 2017",KARACHI HIGH COURT SINDH, Honorable Justice Muhammad Saleem Jessar ,2018 YLR 1307,"ORDER
 MUHAMMAD SALEEM JESSAR, J.---
Applicant Zameer Bohio is an accused of Crime No.17/2017 registered with Police. Station Hingorja under sections 427, 379, P.P.C.; is aggrieved by the order dated 02.05.2417 whereby learned Magistrate by concurring his opinion with police report viz second investigation has accepted the challan; took cognizance of the case and ordered for issuance of NBWs against absconder accused while notice to present applicant and co-accused Abdul Latif and Nazeer who have been granted bail by the competent Court of law having jurisdiction.
2.
 The crux of prosecution case, as unfolded by Raheem Bux Sahito in his FIR No.17/2017, are that he has obtained the land on lease in which mustard crop and live trees of acacia are standing. On fateful day he was available at his land where accused Zameer Hussain (present applicant), 2. Abdul Lateef, 3. Nazeer, 4. Shareef Bhutto along with two unknown accused, duly armed with pistols, were cutting the standing trees of acacia with cutter and hatchets and stolen away by keeping pieces of trees on donkey cart within their sight. Due to weapons the complainant party could not resist and remained mum. Later they noticed three trees were cut off and stolen away and due to falling down of the trees, the standing crop had also sustained damages. The complainant narrated above facts to one Mumtaz Hussain Sahito, Nekmard of his village, who asked that he would try to get stolen trees returned or may hold Faisla but accused did not turn at the call of Nekmard and ultimately on his advise present FIR was lodged.
3.
 After registration of case police took-up investigation, during the investigation instant case was found false therefore police have disposed of FIR under false 'B' Class with such recommendation, the papers were submitted before learned Magistrate. The learned Magistrate after scrutinizing the investigation papers did not agree with police report and directed the SSP concerned to conduct fresh/second investigation into the allegations contained in FIR by his order dated 29.03.2017. In compliance of his order the matter was reinvestigated and the charge-sheet dated 26.04.2017 in terms of section 173, Cr.P.C. was submitted by the I.O. before the concerned Court having jurisdiction. The learned Magistrate after accepting the challan/charge-sheet took cognizance of the case vide impugned order dated 02.05.2017 and the case against the applicant and others was instituted being Crl. Case No.68/2017 re-State v. Zameer Hussain and others.
4.
 Learned counsel for the applicant states that the FIR, lodged by complainant, is false one and prior to this he had filed 02 FIRs against the accused in which, he has been acquitted. He further submits that there is civil litigation pending between the parties and therefore instant case is nothing but to exert illegal pressure upon the accused so that they may withdraw from their case. He further submits that the I.O. had disposed of the FIR under false 'B' Class and recommended for initiation of proceedings under section 182, P.P.C. against the complainant. The second I.O. has found the accused to be offender, submitted challan and after challan, trial Court has taken cognizance of the case. He further prays for quashment of the proceedings culminating from Crime No.17/2017 of Police Station, Hingorja.
5.
 On the other hand learned DPG for the State along with second I.O. Muhammad Ameen Pathan is present and states that the case filed by complainant was genuine one and the applicant was found culprit of the crime as alleged in the FIR, therefore I.O. has charge-sheeted him. He further submits that the trial Court has taken cognizance therefore, best course for the applicant is to face trial instead of pressing instant proceedings.
6.
 I have heard counsel for the applicant and learned DPG for the State and have also gone through the material available on record.
7.
 At the very outset, I would say that the inherent jurisdiction, as provided under section 561-A, Cr.P.C., is not an alternate or an additional jurisdiction but it is a jurisdiction preserved in the interest of justice to redress wrong for which no other procedure is available or has been provided by the code itself. Reference may be made to the case of Asfandyar and another v. Kamran and another 2016 SCMR 2084 wherein it is held as:
""The remedy under section 561-A, Cr.P.C. is not an alternate or substitute for an express remedy as provided under the law in terms of sections 435 to 439 Cr.P.C. Jurisdiction under section 561-A, Cr.P.C. is neither alternative nor additional in its nature and is to be rarely invoked only to secure the end of justice so as to seek redress of grievance for which no other procedure is available.""
I would also add that normally, every case is to be allowed to proceed according to law and resort to the provision of section 561-A, Cr.P.C. should be avoided particularly where the relief, sought through this course, has been provided by the Code itself as it would tend to circumvent the due process of law which has never been the intention of law. However, I would not hesitate in saying. that this remedy however would be available only in exceptional cases i.e. where insisting upon normal procedure/course may amount to continuity of an illegality or may be an injustice such as a case of abduction where abductee himself/herself denies to have been abducted and apprehends arm in approaching to trial Court. Reference may be made to the case of Ghulam Muhammad v. Muzamil Khan and 4 others PLD 1967 SC 317.
""The inherent jurisdiction given by section 561-A, Cr.P.C. is not an alternative jurisdiction or an additional jurisdiction but it is jurisdiction preserved in the interest of justice to redress grievances for which no other procedure is available or has been provided by code itself. The powers given by this Section can certainly not be so utilized as to interrupt or divert the ordinary code of criminal procedure as laid down in the procedural statute. The High Court should be extremely reluctant to interfere in a case here a competent Court has, after examining the evidence adduced before it, come to the view that a prima facie case is disclosed and has framed charges or summoned the accused to appear, unless it can be said that the charge on its face or the evidence, even if believed, does not disclose any offence.""
8.
 Reference may also be made to Muhammad Khalid Mukhtar v. The State through Deputy Director F.I.A. (PLD 1997 SC 275) and Shaikh Mahmood Saeed and others v. Aamir Nawaz Khan and another 1996 SCMR 839 on the point that this Court would be reluctant to quash the proceedings under section 561-A, Cr.P.C. unless the Court is approached for, that exercise of it's powers under section 249-A or 265-K, Cr.P.C. which are incidentally at the same nature and in a way akin to and co-relating with quashing of proceedings and that resort to the provisions of section 561-A, Cr.P.C. should not be lightly made as same would tend to circumvent the due process of law. Reference can be taken from the case of Shevo v. Regional Police Officer Hyderabad Region Hyderabad and 15 others (PLD 2009 Kar. 24) and the dictum laid down by Honourable Supreme Court in case of Director City Circle GEPCO Ltd. and others v. Shahid Mir and others (PLD 2013 SC 403).
9.
 In the instant case, the applicant's counsel has neither mentioned nor stated that before approaching this court under section 561-A, Cr.P.C. he has approached the trial Court for getting his early acquittal under section 249-A, Cr.P.C. which remedy is analogous to the one, sought through the instant petition. The applicant should have approached trial Court and thereafter, criminal revisional Court if no relief was granted by the trial Court in the first instance under the code of criminal procedure before approaching High Court directly which in the circumstances of case could not be said to be proper as it would amount to diverting and interrupting ordinary course, provided by the Code of criminal procedure.
10.
 The crux and upshot of above discussion is that since after second investigation challan has been submitted by the I.O. and learned Magistrate has taken cognizance of the case therefore quashment of proceedings directly by this Court would tantamount to interruption in ordinary legal course particularly in presence of alternate remedy available to. the applicant in terms of section 249-A, Cr.P.C. I would also add here that second investigation is not barred under the law and difference of opinion (s) of I.Os. of two investigation alone cannot be a ground for an early acquittal but it shall always be the material, so brought onto the record by the Investigation because the Courts should not be influenced from ipse dixit of police which otherwise is not binding upon Magistrate as well trial Court. Thus, recommendation of the case for its disposal under false 'B-class' was/is is no legal weight when the same stood changed by Investigation authority itself. Reference may be made to the case of Raja Khurshid Ahmed v. Muhammad Bilal and others 2014 SCMR 474 wherein it is held as:--
""5. It would be seen that as per settled law there is no bar to the reinvestigation of a criminal case and the police authorities are at liberty to file a supplementary challan even after submission of the final report under section 173, Cr.P.C. However, this cannot be done after the case has been disposed of by the learned trial Court.
Further, there has been placed nothing on record which could be taken as an exception for allowing deviation to normal procedure. The plea (s) of pending civil litigation and even lodgment of criminal cases against each other are not the grounds to plainly declare an allegation as false but may well be taken as defence which too at proper stage of trial. While exercising inherent jurisdiction this Court never dresses itself as that of trial Court but can well be exercised where continuity of a complained proceedings prima facie, without much deliberation, appears to be on illegality or injustice. The allegations contained in FIR cannot be properly threshed out as controversy requires evidence hence cannot be resolved by this Court through instant proceedings. I would now add that insist to adopt normal procedure has been for a reason because inherent jurisdiction of this Court under section 561-A, Cr.P.C. is not analogous to that of trial Court or Magistrate concerned who otherwise are competent to examine all the available material while this Court only has to see prima facie illegality resulting or likely to result into injustice. The legal position of the case is that it is primarily domain of learned trial Court who took cognizance and can properly adjudicate upon the factual controversy emanating from the allegations mentioned in the FIR which is ultimate and proper forum for finally deciding the case on its own merits. Thus, the honourable Supreme Court in a case of Director General, Anti-Corruption Estt. v. Muhammad Akram Khan PLD 2013 SC 401 categorically has held as:--
""2 . The law is quite settled by now that after taking of cognizance of a case by a trial court the FIR registered in that case cannot be quashed and the fate of the case and of the accused persons challaned therein is to be determined by the trial court itself. It goes without saying that if after taking of cognizance of a case by the trial court an accused person deems himself to be innocent and falsely implicated and he wishes to avoid the rigours of a trial then the law has provided him a remedy under sections 249-A/265-K, Cr.P.C. to seek his premature acquittal if the charge against him is groundless or there is no probability of his conviction.
11.
 The applicant has prima facie by-passed the ordinary legal course available to him, provided under the criminal procedure code, and since there has been placed no exceptional circumstances to justify departure from normal course hence in absence thereof inherent powers under section 561-A, Cr.P.C. cannot be exercised which otherwise would amount to interrupt and divert the ordinary code of criminal procedure. The applicant can agitate, the same plea before the trial court. In the circumstances, this criminal miscellaneous application is incompetent, which is hereby dismissed leaving the applicant to agitate his remedy before the trial Court which (trial Court) would pass an appropriate order within four corners of law.

32,KHAMISO Versus State,"June 9, 2017",FEDERAL SHARIAT COURT, Honorable Justice Mrs. Ashraf Jahan ,2017 PLD 98,"JUDGMENT
 MRS ASHRAF JAHAN, J:-
 The above titled criminal appeal was disposed of vide short order dated 07.06.2017 which reads as under:
""Heard learned counsel for the appellant and the learned Prosecutor General Sindh for the State. For reasons to be recorded later, Criminal Appeal No.17/K of 2016 is allowed. The Judgment dated 30.06.2015 passed by the learned 2nd Additional Sessions Judge Sanghar is set aside so also the conviction and sentence awarded to appellant Khamiso S/o Pir Dino Khaskheli and he is acquitted of the charges. He may be released forthwith if not required in any other custody case"".
 Following are the reasons of the above order.
2.
 The appellant Khamiso through this Criminal Appeal has assailed the judgment dated 30.06.2015 passed by the learned 2nd Additional Sessions Judge Sanghar, whereby he was convicted and sentenced under Section 392 P.P.C. for Seven years' R.I. and to pay fine of Rs.10000/-; in case of default in payment of fine to suffer S.I. for three months. He was also sentenced under Section 342 P.P.C. to suffer R.I. for one year and to pay fine of Rs.3000/-, in default thereof to suffer S.I. for one month. The Sentences awarded to him were ordered to run concurrently.
3
 The facts as narrated in the F I R by complainant Ali Hassan are that his uncle Moula Bux owned a Datsun vehicle bearing Registration No.BHB:1754, which was driven by him, and Nabi Bux Khaskheli was its Cleaner. On 12.05.2012 in the evening he was asked by Ustad Muhammad Bachal Malokhani to take ten cooked cauldrons for delivery in marriage ceremony at Tando Adam. At about 6.00 p.m. he took food from Otaq of Rehan Talpur and proceeded towards Tando Adam. At about 1200 hours they were on their way back in Datsun along with empty cauldrons, when at 0100 hours they reached near Suhni Dharti Bus Stop Road, suddenly four culprits armed with weapons intercepted them. They snatched keys of Datsun and robbed Cell Phones from the complainant and Cleaner. They were with open faces and two black colour motorcycles of culprits were also parked there. The culprits took them towards sugarcane crops and tied their hands and legs. One of the culprits started Datsun pick up while three drove away on their motorcycles and all went towards Tando Adam side. At about 0400 hours the complainant and Cleaner untied themselves and came to main road from where they took lift in a truck and reached home. They disclosed above story to their uncle Moula Bux and relative Mumtaz and kept on searching the robbers. During search they came to know that Haroon Majeedano, Lakhadino Majeedano, Ghaffar Majeedano and Khamiso Khaskheli had robbed Datsun along with other articles. They made complaint to Dadlo Majeedano and lnayat Majeedano, who ensured them to settle the issue and return robbed articles but finally on 16.08.2012 they refused to return the robbed property. Thereafter on 17.08 2012 complainant lodged the F I R. at Police Station Jhol, District Sanghar. Police after usual investigation submitted challan before the Court of law against accused Dadlo and lnayat while showing four accused as absconders. Subsequently accused Khamiso was arrested while the rest of the accused were declared as proclaimed offenders.
4
 Charge in the present crime was framed against accused Dadlo, lnayat Ali and Khamiso on 31.12.2012 for offences punishable under Section 17(3) Offences Against Property (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979 and Section 342 P.P.C.to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
5
 Prosecution in support of its case examined complainant Ali Hassan as Ex.11 who produced F.I.R. as Ex.11/A. PW-2 Nabi Bux as Ex. 12 P.W. Moula Bux as Ex.13. At this stage an application under Section 227 Cr.P.C was moved by DDPP for amendment in the charge which was allowed and Amended Charge was framed on 16.04.2017 wherein Section 212 P.P.C. was added. Prosecution further examined PW.4 Anwar Sadat as Ex.20. Investigation officer of this case Additional SHO Arbab Ali was examined as Ex.21, who produced Mushirnama in respect of documents of Datsun as Ex.21/A, Mushirnama of Sarzamin as Ex.21/B. PW-6 Mumtaz Ali was examined as Ex.22. Thereafter prosecution closed its side vide statement dated 07.04.2015 as Ex.23.
6.
 Statements of all three accused were recorded under Section 342 Cr.P.C., wherein they denied allegations leveled by the Prosecution side, however, they neither examined themselves on oath nor any witness in their defence.
7.
 The Trial Court after completion of trial passed the judgment dated 30.06.2015 which is impugned before this Court, whereby the present appellant was convicted, while two accused Dadlo and lnayat were acquitted extending them benefit of doubt.
8
 I have heard Mr. Nadir M. Abro Advocate appearing for the appellant as well as Mr. Zahoor Shah, Assistant Prosecutor General Sindh, for the State. It is contended by learned counsel for the appellant that there are mere words of complainant Ali Hassan against the present appellant. Even the eye-witness PW-Nabi Bux did not identify him as culprit of this crime; most importantly there is inordinate delay in lodging of F.I.R. without any reasonable justification: there is no recovery from the present appellant. Thus the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the charge against him, therefore, the present appeal may be allowed in the interest of justice.
9
 Conversely, it is argued by the learned State Counsel that though there is evidence of PW-Ali Hassan against the present appellant but at the same time there is no corroboratory piece of evidence against appellant to connect him with the commission of crime.
10.
 I have considered the arguments and have perused the record. It is apparent on the face of record that there is inordinate delay in lodging the F.I.R. in the present crime. As per prosecution itself the incident had taken place on 13.05.2012 in the early hours of the night but F.I.R. was lodged on 17.08.2012, after delay of more than three months, for which no plausible explanation is assigned except the words that complainant was searching the culprits, made complaint to Dadlo Majeedano and lnayat Majeedano, who initially promised for return of robbed vehicle but finally refused to return the same. As per prosecution story there were four culprits at the time of incident but challan was produced against six persons. No doubt that complainant in his evidence before Court has nominated present appellant with the commission of crime but the other eye-witness PW- Nabi Bux who was with the complainant at the time of incident did not identify him as accused. This piece of evidence is a major blow to the case of prosecution.
11.
 Further when the evidence of complainant is examined minutely, it clearly reveals that though in the F.I.R. he alleged that the culprits had also snatched two Q-Mobile Phones from the complainant party besides the Datsun and ten empty cauldrons but in his evidence before Court his statement is totally silent about snatching of mobile phones. Similarly, PW Nabi Bux also did not adduce a single word about alleged robbed mobile phones.
12.
 Another important aspect of the case is that there is no recovery from the appellant in this crime. Thus it is significant that there is no corroboratory piece of evidence in support of the words of complainant against the appellant connecting him with commission of crime. 
13.
 It is pertinent to note that in F.I.R. the complainant reported that he approached Dadlo Majeedano and lnayat Majeedano, who assured to settle the dispute and return of vehicle but in his evidence he did not depose a single word against them and deposed that accused Lakhadino kept him on false hopes and after three months refused to return the vehicle, which compelled him to lodge the F.I.R. He attributed only appellant Khamiso for commission of offence and exonerated the rest of the accused facing trial namely Dadlo and lnayat. This self contradictory statement of complainant further creates doubts about the prosecution story.
14.
 In the light of above discussion it appears that prosecution has failed to discharge its burden satisfactorily and there appear major lacunas and contradictions in the evidence brought on record. It is settled law by this time that for giving benefit of doubt to an accused it is not necessary that there should be many circumstances creating doubts. If a simple circumstance creates reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the guilt of accused, then he will be entitled to such benefit not as a matter of grace and concession but as a matter of right. Reliance in this regard is placed on the case of Tariq Pervez v. State (1995 SCMR 1345)
14(sic). The upshot of the above discussion is that there being no satisfactory basis for upholding the conviction and sentence of the appellant, therefore, the impugned judgment was set aside and criminal appeal was allowed by short order.

 ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J.---
Kaleemullah, the petitioner has invoked the revisional jurisdiction of this Court, being dissatisfied from order dated 22.04.2017 of learned Additional Sessions Judge-I, Lakki Marwat, with the following prayer:
""By accepting this revision petition, the impugned orders of the learned trial court dated 22.04.2017 may kindly be set aside. It is further prayed that the learned trial Court may be directed to allow the defence counsel for further cross-examination related to the questions which could not be asked due to impugned orders of the learned trial Court.""
2.
 Short and relevant facts of the case are that petitioner is an under trial prisoner in sessions case No.45 of 2017, vide FIR No.64 dated 24.02.2015 under sections 302/324, P.P.C, Police Station Tajori.
3.
 Challan was submitted on 29.10.2015, thereafter petitioner was formally indicted on 20.11.2015. The prosecution produced and examined eleven (11) PWs. The controversy which is the subject matter of the present revision petition ensued during the cross-examination of PW-12, Mutabar Khan, Investigating Officer of case, when the following questions were asked from the said PW, which were objected by counsel for the complainant and the objections were sustained by the learned Trial Court, the above referred questions are reproduced below.
""Question
. Can you tell that you have mentioned the fact of receiving a reference chit from the constable on first day of investigation in case diary No.1.
Objection by counsel for the complainant:
 The question with regard to contents of Zimnies cannot be put by defence unless and until the same is referred by the witness himself.
 
Order of the Court:
 Objection sustained.
Again another question of defence also met the same fate, which is given below:
 
Question;
 Did you write all the case diaries on the spot or in P.S?
Objection by counsel for the complainant
: The question with regard to preparation of Zimnies cannot be put by defense unless and until the same is referred by the witnesses himself.
 Order of the Court
: Objection sustained.
4.
 Before responding the controversy involved in the revision, this would be appropriate to quote the relevant provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code and Articles of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order.
 
172 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
172. Diary of proceedings in investigation
. (1) Every police-officer making an investigation under this Chapter shall day by day enter his proceedings in the investigation in a diary, setting forth the time at which the information reached him, the time at which he began and closed his investigation, the place or places visited by him, and a statement of the circumstances ascertained through his investigation.
(2) Any Criminal Court, may send for the police-diaries of a case under inquiry or trial in such Court, and may use such diaries not as evidence in the case, but to aid it in such inquiry or trial. Neither the accused nor his agents shall be entitled to call for such diaries, nor shall he or they be entitled to see them merely because they are referred to by the Court; but if they are used by the police-officer who made them, to refresh his memory, if the Court uses them for the purpose of contradicting such police-officer the provisions of the Evidence Act, 1872 section 161 section 145 as the case may be, shall apply.
 
155, 157 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order.
155. Refreshing memory:
 (1) A witness may, while under examination, fresh his memory by referring to any writing made by himself at the time of the transaction concerning which he is questioned, or so soon afterwards that the Court considers it likely that the transaction was at that time fresh in his memory.
(2) The witness may also refer to any such writing made by any other person, and read by the witness within the time aforesaid, if when he read if he knew it to be correct.
(3) Whenever a witness may refresh his memory by reference to any document, he may with the permission of the Court, refer to a copy of such document:
Provided the Court be satisfied that there is sufficient reason for the non-production of the original.
 (4) An expert may refresh his memory by reference to professional treaties.
157. Right of adverse party as to writing used to refresh memory:
 Any writing referred to under the provisions of the two last proceeding Articles must be produced and shown to the adverse party if he requires it, such party may, if he pleases, cross-examine the witness thereupon.
5.
 Investigation officer of the case is not a formal witness, he is person who has collected the evidence and has placed the same before the Court. He has got a pivotal role under the criminal Justice system. Reliance is placed on case titled ""Abdul Sattar v. The State through Advocate General NWFP"" (2008 SCMR 684), wherein it is held that:
""There is no cavil to the proposition that the Investigating Officer is not a formal witness and his evidence subject to the qualifying test to be believed is at par to that of any other prosecution witnesses""
6.
 More so, collection of evidence does not mean collection of prosecution evidence it includes defence evidence as well. Reliance is placed on case titled ""Shad Mohammad Khan v. The State and another"" (2013 YLR 71 Peshawar), wherein it is held that:
6. It is the duty of Investigating Officer to record the version of the accused party in every case if presented because the Investigating Officer is not only duty bound to collect evidence which favours the prosecution. Investigating Officer is obliged to conduct fair, impartial and honest investigation and to collect the evidence produced by the prosecution as well as on behalf of accused.
7.
 Under section 172(2), Cr.P.C. a Police officer, the investigation officer of the case can refreshes his memory before recording his statement and then under Article 140 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order (section 145 of the Evidence Act) it is the inalienable right of the accused to cross-examine the witness to contradict or corroborate him as the case may be.
8.
 In the instant case, Motabar Khan, Investigation officer, was under examination as PW-12 before the Court and there is nothing on record to show that he was examined without consultation of police file, once he consulted police file then he is amenable to cross-examination. The two questions which were disallowed by the Court, the former was specific to Zmini (daily diary) which in view of this Court was rightly disallowed instead of referring to Zimni (daily diary) the accused or his agent should have referred to the investigation of case, while in latter one the witness should have been allowed to answer the query of defence.
9.
 Be that as it may, once a witness refreshes his memory defence is entitled to see the particular portion of case diaries, at the same time cross-examiner is at liberty to ask questions with regard to the investigation of case because the ultimate is to arrive at a just and proper decision of the case otherwise the Court can look into the diaries and the deposition of witness recorded at the trial and shall form its own opinion without referring the daily diary in its order or judgment as the case may be .
10.
 In view of above observations, this revision petition is disposed of in the following terms that PW-12 Mutabar Khan be re-summoned as witness and defence be allowed to cross-examine him with regard to the investigation of case as provided by section 172(2), Cr.P.C. and 157 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, order accordingly.
JK/253/P
 Order accordingly."
34,MUBARAK Versus State,"June 8, 2017",KARACHI HIGH COURT SINDH, Honorable Justice Salahuddin Panhwar ,2018 YLR 1655,"ORDER
 SALAHUDDIN PANHWAR, J.---
Through instant bail application, applicant is seeking post arrest bail in Crime No.97 of 2015 registered at Police Station Shahdadpur under sections 302, 34, P.P.C.
2.
 Precisely, the relevant facts of the case are that due to land dispute applicant along with co-accused persons attacked upon the complainant party; accused Dildar caused fire shot injury to the deceased Abdul Jabbar who received on his chest and subsequently succumbed to the injuries.
3.
 At the outset learned counsel for the applicant contends that specific role is not assigned to the applicant with regard to causing any injury; deceased received one injury which is specifically alleged against accused Dildar; applicant's role is shown that he was accompanying with the other accused persons hence the question of common intention requires further probe. In support of his contentions, learned counsel has placed reliance on the cases reported as 2014 SCMR 1347, 2012 SCMR 1137 and 2016 MLD 886.
4.
 Learned A.P.G. is not disputing the facts as narrated by the counsel for the applicant, however counsel for the complainant contends that applicability of Section 34, P.P.C. is very much available in this case; applicant joined the other accused persons and by their act one young person lost his life. He placed reliance on the case reported as 2014 PCr.LJ 1415.
5.
 There can be no denial that mere appearance of one's name in FIR is never sufficient to snatch his otherwise guaranteed but the law always requires prima facie existence of reasonable grounds so as to make the Court believe that accused is guilty of an offence falling within prohibitory clause. To curtail the liberty of a person is a serious step in law therefore even while making tentative assessment the judicial scale must be allowed to tilt wherever available material takes it. Referernce may be made to the case of Zaigham Ashraf v. State and others 2016 SCMR 18 wherein it is held as:--
""9. To curtail the liberty of a person is a serious step in law, therefore, the Judges shall apply judicial mind with deep thought for reaching at a fair and proper conclusion albeit tentatively however, this exercise shall not be carried out in a vacuum or in a flimsy and casual manner as that will defeat the ends of justice because if the accused charged, is ultimately acquitted at the trial then no reparation or compensation can be awarded to him for the long incarceration, as the provisions of Criminal Procedure Code and the scheme of law on the subject do not provide for such arrangements to repair the loss, caused to an accused person, detaining him in jail without just cause and reasonable grounds. Therefore, extraordinary care and caution shall be exercised by the Judges in the course of granting or refusing to grant bail to an accused person, charged for offence (s), punishable with capital punishment. The Courts are equally required to make tentative assessment with pure judicial approach of all the materials available on record, whether it goes in favour of the Prosecution or in favour of the defence before making a decision.
This has been basic objective because of which it is by now a well settled principle of law that where an accused of capital punishment even, if succeeds showing absence of reasonable grounds towards his being guilty, the accused is entitled for bail not as a matter of grace but as of right.
 It is settled principle of law that the normally question of vicarious liability is one of further inquiry unless other compelling reasons exist to reach a different conclusion (2010 SCMR 1178). This being so, such question is normally left open for the trial Court to decide. Admittedly, there is no active role assigned to the applicant/accused except that of his alleged presence which in absence of any active role would make the case open for further probe particularly when two other accused persons, similarly charged, were placed in column-II by the investigating agency while submitting the charge sheet. It is also a matter of record that deceased received one injury which has categorically been assigned to the accused Dildar. All these circumstances prima facie show that there are no other exceptional circumstances which could make an exception to principle of law that question of common intention is one of further probe. These facts show that this is the case of further inquiry. Accordingly, the applicant is admitted to post arrest bail subject to his furnishing solvent surety in the sum of Rs.200,000/- (Rupees two lac) and P.R. Bond in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court.
WA/M-151/Sindh
 Bail granted."
35,KHALID HABIB Versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN,"June 8, 2017",LAHORE HIGH COURT LAHORE, Honorable Justice Muhammad Qasim Khan ,2018 YLR 383,"ORDER
 
 MUHAMMAD QASIM KHAN, J.---
Briefly the facts of the case are that while serving as Member Technical PTCL, proceedings under National Accountability Ordinance, 1999 (hereinafter to be called as ""NAB, Ordinance"") were initiated against him, which culminated into filing of a Reference before the Judge, Accountability Court No.II Rawalpindi/Islamabad (to be referred as ""NAB Court"") and as shall be seen from the order dated 17.03.2003 the petitioner opted for plea bargain under section 25(b) of NAB Ordinance, which was allowed by the NAB Court and consequently, per force of Section 25(b) read with Section 15 of the Ordinance, ibid, the petitioner was disqualified from holding the public office w.e.f. 17.03.2003 by an order dated 24.03.2005. By avoiding unnecessary details of litigation, it is to be mentioned here that lastly the petitioner filed Writ Petition No.27001/2011 which was allowed by this Court vide judgment dated 18.12.2012 in the terms that the appellate authority/The President of Pakistan was directed to decide the petitioner's representation and the President of Pakistan vide order dated 31.12.2014 dismissed petitioner's representation, hence, this writ petition.
2.
 It is argued by learned counsel for the petitioner that from the record it is visible that vide order dated 24.03.2015 the petitioner was dismissed from back date i.e. 17.03.2013, whereas, no adverse order could be passed with retrospective effect. Further argued that the petitioner has also been treated discriminately as compared to other two employees namely Khalid Mehmood and Bashir Hussain. The learned counsel while touching the maintainability of this writ petition contended that although subsequently the PTCL was made a company but as earlier the petitioner had served under statutory rules, therefore, in the light of case ""Masood Ahmad Bhatti and others v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, M/O Information Technology and Telecommunication and others"" (2012 SCMR 152), the writ petition is competent against the impugned orders. Lastly prayed that while setting-aside the orders dated 24.03.2005 and 31.12.2014, the order of dismissal from service be converted into an order for compulsory retirement from service.
3.
 On the other hand, the learned law officer assisted by learned counsel for the respondent department argued that as earlier the petitioner was employed in Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation which was converted into Company having the control over its affairs and also with respect to service of its employees, hence, no writ petition against a company is competent. Further argued that under section 25 read with section 15 of NAB Ordinance, after entering into plea bargain the petitioner earned the status of a convict employee, and at the moment plea bargain was accepted, forthwith he ceased to hold public office, as such, no illegality has been committed in the order dated 24.03.2005 whereby the petitioner was dismissed from service w.e.f. 17.03.2003, date of acceptance of his plea bargain. While touching the ground of discrimination it was argued that two wrongs cannot make a right. Lastly, argued although the order passed by the President of Pakistan is not binding on the company but even then in the impugned order each and every aspect has been discussed and the instant writ petition is liable to be dismissed.
4.
 I have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the parties at considerable length and perused the entire relevant record.
5.
 So far as the question of maintainability of instant writ petition is concerned, while deducing analogy from the case ""Masood Ahmad Bhatti and others v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, M/O Information Technology and Telecommunication and others"" (2012 SCMR 152) it becomes clear that earlier the petitioner was employee of Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation having statutory rules, later-on converted into Company but service of the petitioner still will be governed under the statutory rules, therefore, as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the cited case, the instant writ petition is held to be fully competent and maintainable before this court.
6.
 It is admitted position between the parties that proceedings under NAB, Ordinance were initiated against the petitioner a Reference before the NAB Court was submitted and on 17.03.2003 the petitioner opted for plea bargain under section 25(b) read with section 15(a) of NAB Ordinance, which was allowed. For ready reference sections 15(a) and 25(b) of the NAB Ordinance, are reproduced hereunder:--
15. (a) Where an accused person is convicted of [an offence under section 9 of this Ordinance] he shall forthwith cease to hold public office, if any, held by him and further he shall stand disqualified for a period of ten years, to be reckoned from the date he is released after serving the sentence, for seeking or from being elected, chosen, appointed or nominated as a member or representative of any public body or any statutory or local authority or in service of Pakistan or of any Province;
Provided that any accused person who has availed the benefit of [subsection (b) of section] 25 shall also be deemed to have been convicted for an offence under this Ordinance, and shall forthwith cease to hold public office, if any, held by him and further he shall stand disqualified for a period of ten years, to be reckoned from the date he has discharged his liabilities relating to the matter or transaction in issue, for seeking or from being elected, chosen, appointed or nominated as a member or representative of any public body or any statutory or local authority or in service of Pakistan or of any Province,
(b) Any person convicted of an offence [under section 9 of this Ordinance] shall not be allowed to apply for or be granted or allowed any financial facilities in the form of any loan or advances [or other financial accommodation by] any bank or financial institution [owned or controlled by the Government] for a period of 10 years from the date of conviction.
 Section 25(b):-
""(b) Where at any time after the authorization of investigation, before or after the commencement of the trial or during the pendency of an appeal, the accused offers to return to the NAB the assets or gains acquired or made by him in the course, or as a consequence, of any offence under this Ordinance, the Chairman, NAB, may, in his discretion, after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case, accept the offer on such terms and conditions as he may consider necessary, and if the accused agrees to return to the NAB the amount determined by the Chairman, NAB, the Chairman, NAB shall refer the case for the approval of the Court, or as the case may be, the Appellate Court and for the release of the accused.""
This court is aware of the fact that provincial and federal public servants when are proceeded under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 or Federal Investigation Agency Act, 1974 and convicted they are not automatically dismissed or removed from service by virtue of their conviction and the authority i.e. the departmental authority has to proceed separately under the relevant laws and pass an independent order but the special enactment i.e. NAB Ordinance which provides for effective measures and speedy disposal of cases involving corruption, corrupt practices, misuse or abuse of power or authority and misappropriation of property, provides somewhat different mechanism i.e. when an accused enters into plea bargain during investigation or the trial, by bare reading of Section 25(b) read with Section 15 of the NAB Ordinance, is clear that the legislators have taken note of such eventuality and perhaps considering the seriousness of the charge towards the society as a whole, they not only inserted section 15 in the NAB Ordinance but also used the word ""forthwith"" in the said provision, it means that sooner/at the moment when plea bargain is opted by an accused and approved by the court, he at once/ immediately/without any further delay ceases to hold the public office.
7.
 Here in this case, admittedly the plea bargain opted by the petitioner concluded on 17.03.2013, therefore, for all practical purposes the petitioner ceased to remain on job. However, every department is expected to maintain, manage and update the service records of its employees, for various internal purposes like audit, assessment of working strength, creation of new posts, etc. Therefore, despite the fact that petitioner ceased to hold the office on 17.03.2003, the respondent department in order to update its records for departmental intricacies, took up the matter of the petitioner and purely on the basis of his conviction by the NAB, vide Inter Office Memo dated 24.03.2005 the petitioner was dismissed from service w.e.f. 17.03.2003 (the date of conviction by the NAB). The order dated 24.03.2005 though for departmental purposes, yet the same in fact is implementation of specific provision (Section 15) of the NAB Ordinance. In this respect para-5 of the order passed by NAB court against the petitioner is relevant and the same is reproduced hereunder for ready reference:--
""Khalid Habib shall deemed to be convicted under section 9 of the NAB Ordinance and he shall forth with cease to hold public office, if any, held by him and further he shall stand disqualified for a period of ten years, to be reckoned from the date he has discharged his liabilities relating to the matter or transaction. In issue, for seeking form being elected, chose, appointed or nominated as a member or representative of any public body or any statutory or local authority in the service of Pakistan or any of the Province Reference to the extent of Khalid Habib accused be filed.""
In the light of above reproduced paragraph, the contention that the order dated 24.03.2005 amounts to passing of an order with retrospective effect, is not well founded. In this respect the case ""Muhammad Aslam, Ex-Deputy Director (Audit) District Govt. Lahore Region, Lahore v. Auditor-General of Pakistan, Islamabad"" (2013 SCMR 1904) is referred, wherein, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan held that:--
""The law has provided the penalty in the nature of disqualification on entering to plea bargain. It is not in dispute that the plea bargain as entered into and accepted by the Chairman. NAB and the NAB Court accorded approval in terms of section 26(b) of the Ordinance and ordered release of the appellant. As a consequence of the approval, it entails the penalty in terms of proviso to subsection (a) of section 15 of the Ordinance, by which the appellant stood disqualified.""
8.
 As regards the question of discrimination, although the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan jealously safeguards the citizens from any sort of discrimination but whether any illegal act or order by an authority could be made a ground for another legal act/order. I have given my anxious consideration to this aspect, but feel that as the order/act of any subordinate authority is not precedent and has not binding effect on the courts to be, followed and for considering any case whether discrimination has been meted out or not, the courts have to see:--
i)
 if the order has been passed by the Supreme Court or the High Court on a principle of law, that must be followed and no other person should be discriminated;
ii)
 However, when an order is passed by an executive authority then the court while issuing a writ on the ground of discrimination must consider whether such order has been passed fairly, impartially, in a transparent manner and strictly within the parameters of law. If the order does not stand to the above touchstone, then such order could not be weighed to issue writ on the ground of discrimination alone.
In this respect the case ""PRTC v. Mahmood Ahmad"" (2007 PLC 196) is referred, wherein, it has been held that two wrongs do not make a right. Furthermore; the Indian Supreme Court in the case ""Chandigarh Administration v. Jagit Singh and another"" (AIR 1995 Supreme Court 705) held that:--
""8. We are of the opinion that the basis or the principle, if it can be called one, on which the writ petition has been allowed by the High Court, is unsustainable in law and indefensible in principle. Since we have come across many such instances, we think it necessary to deal with such pleas at a little length. Generally speaking, the mere fact that the respondent-authority has passed a particular order in the case of another person similarly situated can never be the ground for issuing a writ in favour of the petitioner on the plea of discrimination. The order in favour of the other person might be legal and valid or it might not be. That has to be investigated first before it can be directed to be followed in the case of the petitioner. If the order in favour of the other person is found to be contrary to law or not warranted in the facts and circumstances of his case, it is obvious that such illegal or unwarranted order cannot be made the basis of issuing a writ compelling the respondent-authority to repeat the illegality or to pass another unwarranted order. The extra-ordinary and discretionary, power of the High Court cannot be exercised for such a purpose. Merely because the respondent-authority has passed one illegal/unwarranted order, it does not entitle the High Court to compel the authority to repeat that illegality over again and again. The illegal/unwarranted action must be corrected, if it can be done according to law-indeed, wherever it is possible, the court should direct the appropriate authority to correct such wrong orders in accordance with law, but even if it cannot be corrected, it is difficult to see how it can be made a basis for its repetition. By refusing to direct the respondent authority to repeat the illegality, the court is not condoning the earlier illegal act/order nor can such illegal order constitute the basis of a legitimate complaint of discrimination. Giving effect to such pleas would be prejudicial to the interest of law and will do incalculable mischief to public interest.""

 For what has been discussed above, I do not see any merit in this writ petition and the same is dismissed.

 KHADIM HUSSAIN TUNIO, J.---
Through this common order, I propose to dispose of captioned applications for grant of bail as same are outcome of same FIR hearing No.142 of 2014.
2.
 Succulently, the facts of the prosecution case are that on 30.12.2014, at about 01:50 p.m., at the Otaq of applicant Ihsan Ahmed situated in Deh Metahar, complainant Baia Muhammad along with his brother Noorullah, Muhammad Alim and Haji Thahrio were available for taking lea can the invitation of applicant Ihsan, where applicants namely Ihsan Ahmed, Sultan and Farooque with co-accused Abdul Jabbar. Imdad and one unidentified person were sitting in the Otaq. After taking tea. accused persons went home and brought guns and K.Ks, aiming their weapons upon the deceased Noorullah and declared him as Karo. Applicant Ihsan fired from his KK upon deceased Noorullah, in the meantime, applicant Sultan and Farooque with co-accused Abdul Jabbar also tired with K.Ks, directly upon the deceased Noorullah. with the intention to commit his Qatal, the bullets directly hit him, who after receiving tire arm injuries/fell down. 'Thereafter, all the applicants and co-accused fled away from the scene. Thereafter, on 31.12.2014, at around 01:50 p.m. the complainant recorded the FIR after the funeral of the deceased.
3.
 Learned Counsel for the applicants submits that the applicants are innocent and have been falsely involved in this case by the complainant party; that all the witnesses are close relatives and deeply interested in the prosecution case; that applicants namely Sultan and Farooque were found innocent by the Investigating Officer and their names were placed in Column No.2 of the challan, but learned Magistrate while taking cognizance issued NBWs against them; that there is delay of three days in lodging of the FIR, hence false implication of applications after due consultation cannot be ruled out at this stage; that applicant Ihsan was arrested by the police on 11.01.2015 and till this day is behind the bars; that soon after the incident, complainant obtained a letter (lash chakas form) for the post mortem and after postmortem and observing funeral ceremony of the dead body, went to police station where he reported. the matter though there was sufficient time with the complainant to register the FIR, but he failed to do so. After the arrest of applicant Ihsan, not a single incriminating article was recovered from his possessions which may connect him with this crime; that applicants Ihsan and Farooque and co-accused Abdul Jabbar all fired at the deceased, hence it would be determined at trial; that which shot was fatal and caused the death of the deceased; that majority of the co-accused persons have been let off during the course of investigation, which facts make the case of prosecution of two versions; that the applicants namely Sultan and Farooque after grant of interim relief were attending the learned trial Court regularly for a period of about 4/5 months and never misused the concession of bail; that the case has been challaned as such, the applicants are not required for investigation purpose; that it is the tendency of area to involve as many as innocent persons along with actual culprits just to settle the account of their enmity; that when the NB Ws were already converted into B.Ws by this Court then there was no need to cancel the pre-arrest bail of applicants namely Sultan and Farooque; that the case of applicants requires further inquiry as contemplated under subsection (2) of section 497, Cr.P.C.; that co-accused Imdad has already been granted post-arrest bail by this Court; that police after registration of FIR thoroughly investigated the case, recorded 161, Cr.P.C. statements of independent witnesses and came to conclusion that applicants are innocent, hence case of prosecution has become of two versions, which one is correct, it is yet to be determined at trial, that there is inordinate delay in conclusion of trial and such delay is attributed on the part of complainant party; that expeditious trial is right of every accused which cannot be denied to the present applicants. He has cited case-law reported as 1998 SCMR 01, 2004 PCr.LJ 1843, 2005 MLD 1267, 2016 YLR 2671, PLJ 2013 73, 2010 SCMR 966, 1995 SCMR 1765, 2016 PCr.LJ Note 73 and unreported authority Cr.B.A.No.S-552 of 2015, Re: Abdul Wahid v. The State, Cr.Misc.A.No.S-105 of 2010, Re: Loung Khan and others v. The State, Cr.Misc.A.No.S-111 of 2015, Re: Muhammad Afzal and others v. The State and Criminal Petition No.105-K of 2002.
4.
 As against this, Learned APG opposed the bail application of applicants. While Messrs Shafi Muhammad Mahar and Gul Muhammad Mahar argued that names of applicants are disclosed in the FIR with specific role; that the bail of applicant Sajjad Ahmed was dismissed as withdrawn on 24.08.2015; that the bail application filed on behalf of applicant Sajjad Ahmed is not maintainable at law; that police opinion regarding innocence of applicants Sultan and Farooq is not binding upon the court; that the delay in conclusion of trial is attributed to the applicants as in this case charge against the accused persons was framed on 01.03.2016 and the matter adjourned to 16.012016 for evidence. on 16.03.2016. 14.04.2016. 25.08.2016 and 01.09.2016 the complainant \\vas in attendance but the learned counsel for applicants was called absent, as such, matter was adjourned; that the delay if any is not attributed on the part of complainant party, hence he prayed for rejection of bail application.
5.
 Having heard and perused the relevant record carefully with their assistance.
6.
 On perusal of case papers, it appears that applicants are nominated in the FIR with specific allegations; that the applicants along with co-accused had allegedly committed murder of deceased Noorullah. This fact finds support from the statements of prosecution witnesses recorded under section 161, Cr.P.C. Nothing has been brought on record that prosecution witnesses have any ill will or grudge against the applicants, which prima-facie shows involvement of the applicants in this case of serious and heinous in nature and the punishment for offence with which present applicants are booked falls under the o prohibitory clause of section 497, Cr.P.C.
7.
 Applicants also seek bail on the ground of statutory delay in conclusion of trial, therefore, I have gone through the newly amended provision in section 497, Cr.P.C., which o contemplates that where court is of the opinion that delay in trial of the accused has not been occasioned by an act or omission of the accused or any person acting on his behalf, direct that such accused persons be released on bail, who is accused of an offence punishable with death, has been detained for such offence for continuous period exceeding two years and trial has not been concluded provided that the above benefit will not be available to a previously convicted offender for an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life. As far as the delay for non conclusion of trial within a period of two years is concerned, it is to be noted that on 16.03.2016, 14.04.2016, 25.08.2016 and 01.09.2016 although prosecution witnesses were present in court for recording of evidence but case could not be proceeded on account of non-availability of defence counsel or adjourned at the request of defence counsel. As per case diaries of trial court available on record, which shows that defence was responsible for causing delay in finalization of trial within the period of two years. The intention of law is to see that whether finalization of the trial has taken place on account of the delay caused by the defence. In the case of Akhtar Abbas v. The State reported in PLD 1982 SC 424, adjournments were sought on eight occasions and it was observed that all that is necessary to be seen whether the delay in finalization of the trial has, in any manner, been delayed by an act or omission on the part of the prosecution or defence. In the case in hand, delay was partly attributed to the applicants, which was clear Vifrom the diary sheet of the trial Court. Again in another case of Muhammad Younis v. The State reported in 1995 SCMR 1087, it was held that the defence on four occasions had requested for adjournment and the accused, therefore, was not entitled to concession of bail. Also in the case of Javid-ur-Rehman another v. The State reported in 2010 SCMR 1744 although on one date, prosecution witnesses were present in Court but counsel for accused did not appear for recording of evidence, bail was refused by 1-Ion'ble Supreme Court.
8.
 It is settled proposition of law that in criminal administration of justice, each case has to be decided on its own facts and circumstances and Courts are required to exercise jurisdiction independently. Reliance in this respect is placed on a case of The State v. Haji Kabeer Khan reported in PLD 2005 Supreme Court 364 and in case of Muhammad Faiz alias Bhoora v. The State and another reported in 2015 SCMR 655, it has been held as under:--
""S. 497(2)---Bail---Case-law cited by counsel for accused in support of bail--Relevance---Precedents in bail matters were of no help to a party, as it varied from case to case depending upon the facts of each case---Court had to examine as to whether accused had made out a case of further inquiry or not.""
9.
 In another case of Farrukh Qadri v. State (2006 PCr.LJ 1256), it has been held by this Court as fallows:
""The narration of the facts, depicting the picture of attendance of witnesses in the year 2005 shows that they were present on 10 dates and it is not difficult to visualize that these were not the only dales when they appeared and case did not proceed and, therefore, they lost patience and discontinued to appear before the Court. The prosecution and defence are not supposed to test patience of the witnesses and when they lose it then start claiming concession. The benefit can be sought only if the witnesses fail to appear in order to cause the delay and extend the incarceration of the accused person in jail.""
""When the 3rd and 4th proviso to section 497, Cr.P.C. were on the Statute Book, this point was considered by several superior Courts. Pre-dominant view was that if the witnesses appeared on several dates and were not examined, their subsequent absence, shall not justify the release of accused on bail as a matter of right and same principle is still applicable when the bail is not be granted as a matter of right but can be considered on the ground of inordinate delay in disposal of the case.
""I would also like to observe that generally the trial Courts appear to be totally oblivious of the provisions contained in section 540-A, Cr.P.C. and, therefore, are not resorting to this provision, in any case, which was inserted to meet the eventualities as in this case. It appears that the learned Advocate for the complainant and prosecutor, as well as the learned defence counsel .failed to assist the Court and never made a request that if one or two accused were not produced on any particular date, while other accused persons were present before the Court and the witnesses were in attendance, and the accused who were not produced before the Court were represented through the Advocate the case could be proceeded with. I am of the opinion that the trial Court, prosecutor, Advocate for the complainant and the defence Advocates have equally contributed in causing delay in disposal of the case and perpetrating the agony on the accused as well as prosecution witnesses. This state of affairs cannot he termed as satisfactory by any stretch of imagination. The system of law can work properly if all the stake-holders perform their duty properly and with due diligence. Be that as it may, the entire responsibility for delay cannot he saddled on the shoulder of prosecution witnesses, therefore, I am of the opinion that the applicant is not entitled to he released on bail. The bail application stands dismissed accordingly.""
10.
 For the above stated reasons, criminal bail applications are dismissed. However, trial Court is directed to decide the case within a period of three months time its compliance report be submitted to this Court through learned Additional Registrar for perusal.
11.
 As far as case law referred by learned counsel for applicants at Bar are; riled, the same have been perused and considered but the same are distinguishable the facts of the case in hand.
12.
 Needless to mention here that the observations made hereinabove are tentative in nature and would not influence trial Court while deciding the case of applicants/accused on merits.

 MUHAMMAD AYUB KHAN, J.---
Having failed to get the concession of bail from the Courts of learned Judicial Magistrate-II, D.I.Khan and learned Additional Sessions Judge-I, D.I.Khan vide orders dated 12.4.2017 and 19.4.2017 respectively, accused/ petitioner Faheem Ullah has filed the instant petition for the same relief in case FIR No.308 dated 05.4.2017 registered under Section 489-F, P.P.C. at Police Station Cantt, D.I.Khan.
2.
 As per contents of FIR, complainant Muhammad Noor submitted an application dated 29.3.2017, to the District Police Officer, D.I.Khan to the effect that the accused/petitioner obtained Rs.2,18,00,000/- from him for the purpose of business of medicine and in this regard on 26.7.2016, he issued two cheques i.e. one cheque bearing No.34414728 amounting to Rs.1,18,00,000/- and other cheque bearing No.34414729 amounting to Rs.10000000/- of Habib Bank Ltd. Circular Road Branch, D.I.Khan for encashment on 25.3.2017 and also scribed an Iqrar Nama dated 26.7.2016 in favour of complainant in presence of witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan and Din Muhammad. On 28.3.2017, the complainant submitted cheque No.34414729 worth Rs.100,00,000/- in his account at United Bank Ltd. Circular Road Branch, D.I.Khan for transfer of amount from the account of accused/petitioner but it was dishonoured due to insufficient funds. On the application of complainant/ respondent No.2 above referred FIR was registered against the accused/ petitioner.
3.
 Arguments heard and record perused.
4.
 Admittedly, the accused/petitioner issued the cheque in question to the complainant which was dishonoured vide cheque return memo dated 28.3.2017 for reason of insufficient funds, which prima facie establish that the petitioner was having no intention to pay the outstanding amount to the complainant. The act of the petitioner amounts to financial murder of the complainant. 
5.
 It is also on the record that the accused/petitioner issued cheque of Rs.2,75,00,000/- in favour of one Zawail which was dishonoured and in this respect a case vide FIR No.245 dated 21.3.2017 was registered under section 489, P.P.C. at Police Station Cantt, D.I.Khan against the accused/petitioner which prima facie suggest that he is habitual offender of issuance of cheques and defrauding the people.
6.
 No doubt the case in hand is not covered by the prohibitory clause of section 497, Cr.P.C., but that alone cannot hold the petitioner entitled to the concession of bail. In such like cases, grant of bail is not a rule of universal application and each case is to be decided on the basis of its own merits keeping in view its own set of facts and circumstances. Reliance may safely be placed on Muhammad Siddique v. Imtiaz Begum and 2 others (2002 SCMR 442), Shameel Ahmad v. The State (2009 SCMR 174) and Muhammad Imran v. The State and another (2012 YLR 2748).
7.
 The tentative assessment of the available record prima facie connects the accused/petitioner with the commission of the offence and he is not entitled to the concession of bail. Consequently, his instant petition for release on bail is dismissed.

 WAQAR AHMAD SETH, J.---
Accused-petitioner, Mosam Khan son of Rasheed Khan, seeks bail in case FIR No. 06 dated 8.1.2006 under sections 302/364/34, P.P.C. registered at Police Station Mattani, Peshawar. He has been refused bail by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-XIV, Peshawar vide order dated 12.4.2017; hence, the instant petition for the same purpose.
2.
 Brief facts of the case are that father of the complainant, namely, Muslim Khan was abducted on 6.11.2005 at 0900 a.m. by the petitioner along with his co-accused, namely, Hassan Khan son of Rasheed Khan, Yaqoob Khan, Saeed Khan sons of Abdul Hameed, Abdul Hameed son of Gul Mir from the vicinity of Government High School Sherkera in the presence of Shah Zaman son of Abdul Hanan and Zahid Hussain son of Abdul Ghani and shifted him to tribal territory. However, on the same day, the abductee was killed. Motive is stated to be blood feud enmity. According to the complainant, the dead body was discovered by the political authorities and was brought to the village whereafter it was taken to the police station for registration of FIR but the local police refused the same; hence, he filed an application under section 22-A, Cr.P.C. before competent court of law, which was allowed on 2.1.2006 and on basis of which, the instant FIR was registered.
3.
 At the very outset, learned counsel for the complainant raised objection that this Court has got no jurisdiction to entertain the present bail petition because the deceased was done to death in the tribal territory and the accused-petitioner is required to approach the appropriate forum for such a relief. To meet the objection, first, I would like to reproduce section 403, Cr.P.C., which reads as under:
""403. Persons once convicted or acquitted not to be tried for the same offence. (1) A person who has once been tried by a Court of competent jurisdiction for an offence and convicted or acquitted of such offence shall, while such conviction or acquittal remains in force, not to be liable to be tried again for the same offence "".
 Similarly, this Court in the case of Munawar Khan v. Political Agent Khyber Agency Station and 4 others (2012 MLD 503), has held that:
""Ss. 365/400/401/411---Frontier Crimes Regulation, 1901, Ss. 11 & 48---Criminal Procedure Code (V of 1898), Ss. 180 & 403---Constitution of Pakistan, Arts. 199 & 13---Constitutional petition---Abducting, belonging to gang of dacoits and dishonestly receiving stolen property---Jurisdiction of court---Double jeopardy---Counsel for petitioner/accused had contended that as the case was registered at Police Station at Peshawar, and according to the FIR alleged abductee was abducted from settled area, Assistant Political Agent had no jurisdiction to try and convict accused; that no person would be prosecuted or punished for the same offence more than once and that all judgments under Frontier Crimes Regulation as well as by Judicial Magistrate Peshawar, be set aside and accused acquitted of the charge---Validity---Alleged abductee was abducted from the jurisdiction of Police Station at Peshawar; and was recovered from a place situated in Tribal Areas falling within the jurisdiction of Assistant Political Agent---Both Assistant Political Agency and Judicial Magistrate Police Station Peshawar had the jurisdiction to try accused as provided under S. 180, Cr.P.C.---Article 13 of the Constitution provided that no person would be prosecuted or punished for the same offence more than once which had also been provided under S. 403, Cr.P.C.---Subsequent trial of accused person by Judicial Magistrate Peshawar and his judgment, were violative of Art. 13 of the Constitution and S. 403, Cr.P.C. and were of no legal consequence"".
 In the instant case, co-accused of the petitioner, namely, Saeed Khan and Abdul Hameed were tried by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-VII, Peshawar and they were acquitted vide judgment/order dated 26.2.2010, against which, the complainant filed Cr.A. No. 291/2010 before this Court but the same was also dismissed in limine vide order dated 3.2.2011. Moreover, another co-accused, namely, Muhammad Yaqoob was also allowed bail by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-III, Peshawar vide order dated 4.5.2012 and against the said order, the complainant filed cancellation petition before this Court, which too, was dismissed vide order dated 15.2.2013, so keeping in view the above facts and circumstances of the case and while taking guidance from the judgment reported in 2012 MLD 503 (referred above) along with section 403, Cr.P.C., this Court has the jurisdiction to entertain the present bail petition; hence, the objection so raised by the learned counsel for the complainant is overruled.
4.
 Arguments heard and record perused.
5.
 Without going into deep merits of the prosecution case, suffice it to say, that five (05) persons have been charged by the complainant for the murder of his father Muslim Khan with no specific role, out of them, two were acquitted and one was granted bail by the competent court of law, whose trial is still pending. The case of present accused-petitioner is at par with them and he deserves alike treatment. Besides, the accused-petitioner, after arrest, remained in police custody but no recovery or discovery has been made from him.
6.
 As far as the abscondance of accused-petitioner is concerned, it has been settled law that mere abscondence is no ground to decline the bail, if the case of an accused is otherwise found fit for bail on merits and the bail cannot be refused even if he had remained an absconder. Reliance can be placed on the cases of State v. Malik Mukhtiar Ahmed (1991 SCMR 322) and Mitho Pitafi v. The State (2009 SCMR 299). Accused-petitioner is behind the bars since 31.1.2017. Investigation in the case is complete and the accused-petitioner is no more required for further investigation and keeping him behind the bars would serve no useful purpose, therefore, this Court is inclined to extend the concession of bail to him.
7.
 In view of the above, this bail application is accepted and the accused-petitioner is admitted to bail provided he furnishes bail bond in the sum of Rs. 400,000/- (Rs. Four lacs) with two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate, who shall ensure that the sureties are local, reliable and men of means.
8.
 Above are the reasons of my short order of even date.

 TAHIR ZIA, MEMBER (JUDICIAL-II).---
Through this common order, I intend to dispose off four (04) Appeals bearing Nos.K-1224, 1223/2016, K-1226 and 1225/2016 directed against Order-in-Original Nos. 664/2015-16 and 665/2015-2016 dated 20.04.2016 passed by Additional Collector of Customs, Adjudication-I, Customs House, Karachi.
2.
 Since, these 04 appeals are based on similar facts and questions of law, therefore, it is needless to reproduce facts of each case separately. Hence, being heard and dealt with and disposed off simultaneously though this common order in the light of the judgment of the Honorable High Court of Sindh in Customs Reference No. 157 of 2008, S.M. Naqi son of Syed Muhammad Hussain v. Collector of Customs (Adj-I) and others. For reference the facts of Appeal No.K-1224/2016 as reported by the Directorate General of Intelligence and Investigation-Customs, Enforcement, Karachi (here-in-after to be referred as respondent No. 2), M/s. Chief Auto Centre (Pvt.) Ltd., Lahore (here-in-after as Appellant No. 1) imported a consignment machinery/excavator parts stuffed in 1 x 40"" container. Upon receipt of import documents delivered those to his clearing agent M/s. Haris Enterprises, Karachi (here-in-after as Appellant No. 2) for transmitting Goods Declaration under the provision of section 79(1) of the Customs Act, 1969 and Rule 433 of Sub-Chapter III of Chapter XXI of Customs Rules, 2001 with the MCC of Appraisement-West, which he did and as per pre-requisite deposited upfront duty and taxes, consequent to which GD was numbered as KAPW-HC-62483 dated 08.10.2015. Upon appearance of Goods Declaration, the nominated Appraiser instead of completing the assessment on the basis of the declaration and scanned documents, opted to get the goods examined under Section 198 of the Act and Rule 435 of the Rules. He while adducing his opinion transmitted the GD to the Deputy Collector of the Group, who gave his assent and transmitted the GD to the Deputy Collector KICT, who marked that to the examiner for conduction of physical examination of the imported goods for determination of actual description, quantity and quality. The examiner concerned carried out the examination and found the goods in accordance with the declaration and report so prepared was posted by him in the reservoir of the Goods Declaration. The nominated Appraiser upon appearance of report on his desktop, completed the assessment and passed assessment order under Section 80 of the Act and Rule 438 of the Rules and transmitted view message for payment of additional amount of duty and taxes, which was deposited by the appellant No. 2 after obtaining pay order from appellant No. 1, consequent to which the inbuilt authority of the WeBOC passed Clearance Order in terms of Section 83 of the Act and Rule 442 of the Rules. Immediately, after passing of Clearance Order, the officials of respondent No. 2 blocked the delivery and thereafter detained the goods on the plea that the assessment order so passed is erroneous being passed on the basis of declaration and examination report, scanned documents/catalogues upon receipt of view message under Rule 437 of the Rules, which is contrary to the actual description and classification of the goods. The official of respondent No. 2 subsequently examined the goods, which transpired that the appellant No. 1 in active connivance of appellant No. 2 has obtained clearance of auto parts of trucks in the garb of machinery and excavator parts, which are poles apart from each other auto parts falls under PCT 8409.9910 as against declared and assessed 8409.9999 and 8483.6099, this resulted in loss of Rs. 2,444,889.00 and the act of the appellant's falls within the ambit of section 32(1) and (2) sections 3, 4, 6, 33 and 34 of the Sales Tax , 1990 and section 148 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, punishable under clause (14) of section 156(1) and aforesaid Sections of the Sales Tax and Income Tax. As a result of the said finding, the official of respondent No. 2 seized the goods under section 168(1) of the Act and a notice under section 171 was also served upon the appellants. The appellant No. 1 sensing the gravity of the issue filed a Constitution Petition in the High Court of Sindh, which ordered release of the goods after depositing pay order of the amount of revenue loss and post dated cheques against the anticipated imposed fine and penalty. In compliance of the order of the Hon'ble High Court of Sindh after securing the pay order and post dated cheques, the respondent No. 2 ordered MCC of Appraisement-West to release the consignment. Which in the presence of passed assessment order under section 80 of the Customs Act, 1969 piled upon it yet another order passed under section 81 of the Act and the goods were delivered to the appellant No. 1. Thereafter, the officials of respondent No. 2 prepared contravention report and forwarded that to Collector of Customs, Adjudication-I, who referred to the competent authority defined in section 179 of the Act. In consideration of the contravention report, the Additional Collector of Customs, Adjudication-I, issued show-cause notice dated 23.11.2015 containing the facts and the contravening provision of the Act/Ordinance as were reported in the contravention report. The appellant No. 1 replied the show-cause notice, which failed to impress the subordinate of respondent No. 1 and he passed order dated 20.04.2016, through which he held the charges against the appellants as established and ordered confiscation of the goods subject to redemption of those upon payment of 35% of the value of the goods in terms of SRO 499(I)/2009 dated 13.06.2009, imposed penalty of Rs. 200,000.00 on the appellant No. 1 and Rs. 100,000.00 on appellant No. 2, in addition to in addition to the worked out evaded amount of duty and taxes of Rs.2,444,889.00/.
3.
 Being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the order-in-original, the appellant filed the instant appeal before this Tribunal on the grounds incorporated in the memo of appeal. The appellant's counsel further argued that on the basis of grounds of appeal and facts, the instant appeal may kindly be accepted and the Order passed by the adjudicating authority may kindly be set aside in the interest of justice.
4.
 The respondent department has submitted Para-wise comments in reply to the memo of appeal, which are placed on record. The departmental representative further submitted that the Order passed by authority below is correct in facts and law, which is required to be upheld.
5.
 Heard the arguments, and perused the record and the relied upon documents/judgments by the appellant's. It is felt appropriate for me to first settle the objection of the respondent No. 1 that the instant appeals could not be heard for decision unless the imposed fine and penalty is not paid by the appellant as expressed in section 195-B of the Act and for that an appropriate order may be passed, while dismissing the appeals of the appellants as non maintainable. In this context, it is clarified that Section 195-B of the Act, is directory and permissive in nature, therefore the appeal cannot be dismissed on the basis of non deposit of imposed fine/penalty. The said provision is imperative and obligatory as it uses the word ""shall"", this word or must are generally considered as mandatory but it is equally well settled that the word ""shall"" and ""may"" depending upon the context in which they have been said or often interchangeable as held by Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in reported judgment PLD 1972 SC 326 that ""it is now well settled that the words ""may"" and ""shall"" in legal phraseology are interchangeable depending on the context in which they are used or not to be interpreted with the rigidity, which is attributed to them in ordinary parlance."" Although section 195-B of the Customs Act, 1969 while directing the deposit of amount of duty in respect of goods which are not under the control of customs authority or any penalty levied under this Act uses expression ""shall"" no consequences are flowing in the expression for non compliance. Another well settled principle of interpretation of statutes became applicable that as the language of section 195-B of the Customs Act, 1969 is in affirmative and not negative, it is deemed to be directory not mandatory as held in reported judgment PLD 1974 Supreme Court 134 Niaz Muhammad Khan v. Mian Fazal Rakib that ""as a general rule a statute is understood to be directory when it contains matter merely of direction, but not when those direction are followed up by an expressed provision that, in default of following them the fact shall be null and void. To put it differently if the act is directory its disobedience does not entail any invalidity; if the Act is mandatory disobedience entail serious legal consequences amounting to the invalidity of the act, done in disobedience to the provision. The respondent No. 2 failed to appreciate that the provision of section 195-B has to be read in harmony and in the benefit of the appellant because non payment of imposed penalty least snatch his right of appeal guaranteed under section 194-A of the Customs Act, 1969. Hence, it is appropriate to dispense with the condition of payment of penalty as i.e. proper and just course of action and decide the appeal on merit as right of appeal is an inalienable guaranteed under section 194-A and Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan and injunction of Islam beside the said act would had been an act of allowing the appellant a fair trial in terms of Article 10-A of the Constitution of Pakistan 1973 (18 Amendment). My findings have the validation of reported judgment 1993 MLD 1645, 1993 CLC 1405 and 2005 PTD (Trib.) 731.

 Prior to dealing with the merits of the case, it is noted with concern that the Adjudicating Authority, for the purposes of imposition of Redemption Fine, has resorted to application of SRO 499(I)/2009 (which has been issued under the Provisos to section 181 of the Customs Act, 1969) despite there being no allegation as to the subject import being violative of section 15 or a notification issued under section 16 of the Customs Act, 1969 or any other law for the time being in force, which requirements clearly have the mandate of law under the referred Provisos to section 181 of the Customs Act, 1969. Such recourse has been had by the Adjudicating Authority without there being any allegation in such regards either narrated in the Show-Cause Notice or, for that purpose, in the Order-in-Original, impugned in the present appeal. In mounting one illegality upon the other, the Adjudicating Authority has also unlawfully fixed the amount of the Redemption Fine to the extent of 35% of the value of the offending goods in spite of the fact that the honourable Sindh High Court in the case of Weave & Knit (Pvt.) Limited (reported at 2004 PTD 2981) and a Division Bench of the Customs Appellate Tribunal in the case of Novo Nordisk Pharma (reported at 2013 PTD (Trib.) 2186) have held that ""Customs Value"" is to be worked out with reference to the amount of duty/taxes attempted to be evaded and not the value of the ""offending goods"". In accordance with the word of the law as well as the principle laid down by the honourable High Court of Sindh, as followed by a Division Bench of this Customs Appellate Tribunal, I do not have any difficulty in holding that the manner in which the Redemption Fine has been imposed simply militates against the settled principle, of law and is neither warranted nor sustainable under the law.
7.
 Reverting to the factual aspects and merits of the case, the appellant's counsel argued that the engine parts for diesel engines, as imported, were for use in the engines of the earth moving machinery and that there was no strength in the departmental allegation that these had been imported for use in the heavy duty vehicle. To such an end, Goods Declarations were produced on the importer's behalf to substantiate that as a matter of long standing practice like and identical goods had been cleared on the basis that these were to be used in the engines of earth moving machinery. In rebuttal, the DR contended that the subject engine parts were for use in the heavy duty vehicles as was established during the adjudication proceedings on the strength of documents furnished by them. Upon being asked as to whether there was any difference between the engines of the earth moving high-powered machinery and those of the heavy-duty automotive vehicles, satisfactory response was not advanced on the respondents' behalf. It was, nevertheless, contended that the appellant importer commercially imported and dealt in engine parts for heavy duty vehicles which fact gave credence to the fact that the subject imported engine parts were to be used in the heavy duty automotive vehicles and not the earth moving machinery.
8.
 Upon perusal of the operating part of the subject Order-in-Original, it is seen that the documents produced by the appellant, in defending the case made out against them by the officers of the DG I&I-FBR, were not relied upon by the Adjudicating Authority on the basis that these were "" .... Photocopies of the leaflets retrieved by the respondents from different websites . "" and also as ""computer printouts of websites other than the manufacturer and various instructions manuals in Japanese language .."". It is further stated that it was confirmed by the respondent/Detecting Agency that the appellant was the ""importer/ trader"" of automotive engine replacement parts ""for vehicles, including earth moving and other machinery"". The Adjudicating Authority did not take into consideration the Purchase/Supply Order as had been issued to the appellant importer for supply of spare parts of construction machinery on the basis that the appellant importer was not able to produce any evidence by way of Sales Tax Invoice duly supported with Sales Tax Return that they ever supplied an identical part(s) to any construction company/contractor for use in machinery in the past. In the same manner the so-called printouts and leaflets from websites were also purportedly not taken into consideration by the Adjudicating Authority on the pretext that the appellants could not put forth any plausible reason and/or arguments to rebut the charges against them when purportedly and allegedly confronted with the original catalogue of the manufacturer.
9.
 Upon minute examination of what has been stated by the Adjudicating Authority in the impugned Order-in-Original, it is rendered obvious that the appellant importer's two contentions have been given two different and separate treatments. Firstly, the appellant importer's contention that it was an importer of engine replacement parts for vehicles, including earth moving and other machinery was deemed by the Adjudicating Authority to confirm (on account of the use of the word vehicle) that the appellant was the commercial importer of automotive engine replacement parts completely ignoring the fact that the appellant importer had contended that such vehicles also included earth moving and other machinery. Notwithstanding the fact that a quasi-judicial form is not vested with the authority to pick and choose from a party's contention or to interpret it in such manner as is beneficial to the prosecution's case and to discard what is detrimental to it, I also find no justification in the Adjudicating Authority not accepting the Purchase/Supply Order produced by the appellant importer on the pretext that it was not supported by the evidence such as Sales Tax Invoices and Returns as to the past transactions. Once a party, during the adjudication proceedings, has produced documentary evidence as to the legality of its imports then the burden of proof in terms of Sections 156(2) and 187 of the Customs Act, 1969, stands discharged and it is then for the department to prove the party's contentions to be as incorrect, which, in my opinion, was not done in the present case and while the mere use of the word ""vehicles"" in the appellant importer's pleadings was used against him to treat him as a commercial importer of replacement engine parts of vehicles only but simultaneously the other documents that he produced in aid of his contentions that the subject goods were for use in the construction and other machinery was not even considered on the basis of lack of further documentary evidence in such regards as to the ""past transactions"". Accordingly, I find no merit and substance in the Adjudicating Authority's finding as to the subject goods being engine replacement parts to be used in vehicles other than the construction and other machinery.
10.
 In relation to the NPR catalogue, of which there is no mention in the Show-Cause Notice and, therefore, the appellant importer cannot be deemed to be confronted with the same during the adjudication proceedings, the learned DR was specifically asked the question whether the engines used in the construction machinery (excavators, bulldozers, fork-lifters etc.) were any different from those used in the heavy vehicles, trucks and buses, he replied in the negative but asserted that on account of the fact that the appellant importer also dealt in replacement engine part of vehicles, therefore, it cannot be said with certainty that these would indeed be used in the construction machinery. I am not inclined to accept such contention insofar as the classification of any goods is not dependent upon the manner in which these are to be used in the post importation scenario and even otherwise the appellant importer has successfully established the existence of past practice in relation to the subject goods to be cleared under the HS Codes 8409.9999 and 8483.6099. The honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Radaka Corporation reported at 1989 SCMR 353 has held that a departure from departmental practice following a particular course in the implementation of a rule will be extremely unfair.
11.
 Besides the above discussed points of utmost importance. It is further matter of facts that the goods were examined under section 198 of the Act and Rule 435 and thereafter the authorities defined in sections 80 and 83 of the Act in exercise of the powers vested upon them through Notification No.371(I)/2002 dated 15.06.2002 passed valid assessment/ clearance orders, meaning thereby the goods were out of charge of Customs. Those could not be detained or seized by either respondent No.2 or his subordinates for the purpose of examination and assessment or even classification, nothing this sort is permissible as it is settled principle of law that after the goods are out of charge the Customs Officials became functus officio. Even otherwise, powers of valuation, classification and assessment are not available to the official of respondent No.2 under SRO. 486(I)/2007 dated 09.06.2007. In case of apprehension of evasion of duty and taxes, the appropriate course available with the respondent No. 2 was to file an appeal under the provision of Section 193 of the Customs Act, 1969 against the assessment orders passed under Section 80 of the Act and Rule 438 of the Rules, incorporating the apprehension and fact of the case and the contravening provision of the Act/Rules. Upon receipt of appeal, the Collector Appeal if observed that the contention of the officials of respondent No. 2 is correct is empowered to issue show-cause notice under the provision of section 32 to the importer/appellant and upon receipt of the reply to the show-cause notice have to pass an order, after perusal of the grounds of appeal and the reply to the show-cause notice. Instead of adopting the correct course of law, the respondents reopened the assessment order under the provision of Section 195 of the Act, under which only Board or Collector is empowered. The respondents reopened the assessment orders by assuming the powers of Collector, which is tantamount to usurpation and renders the detention/seizure/ show-cause notice and Order-in-Original without power, hence, void and ab-initio and of no legal effect. Similarly, neither respondent No. 2 nor respondent No. 1 is empowered to frame contravention report or issue show-cause notice and pass order-in-original under any provision of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 and Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, by virtue of the fact that none of them are appointed as officer of Inland Revenue under the provision of sections 30-A and 30 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 and sections 228 and 207 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001. Resultant insertion of the provision of Sales Tax and Income Tax in contravention report and invoking of those in the show-cause notice is without lawful authority and as such of no legal effect. This lapse is fatal and renders the action right from detention till order-in-original, ab-initio, null and void.
12.
 It is noted with concern that despite framing of contravention report and issuance of show-cause notice to the appellants under the provision of Section 32(2) of the Act, which speaks about ""deliberate act and collusion"" none of the Customs Officials of MCC of Appraisement-West, who examined the goods and passed assessment/ clearance orders under the provision of sections 198, 80 and 83 of the Act and Rules 435, 437, 438 and 442 of the Rules, have been charged under the provision of Section 32 despite apparent ""deliberate act and collusion"" if analyzed with the contravention report, show-cause notice and order-in-original. If the respondents are of the view that none of the officials of MCC of Appraisement-West are involved, it is hard to digest because none of the appellant are allowed to arrange the examination, instead i.e. arranged by the Terminal Operator on the order of Deputy Collector of Customs KICT or his subordinate. Similarly, the assessment order is passed by the appropriate authority independently without any influence either of the appellants. If it is assumed for the sake of arguments that none of the customs officials were involved, in that case Section 32(2) is not applicable and case in question falls within the ambit of ""error, omission or misconstruction"" attracting the provision of Section 32(3) of the Act, the authority to issue show-cause notice under the said section is Principal Appraiser as enunciated in SRO 371(I)/2002 dated 15.06.2002. To the contrary, in the instant case the show-cause notice and order-in-original have been issued/passed by the Additional Collector. No authority is empowered to assume the powers of his subordinate prescribed for the purpose of adjudication because while performing their duties as quasi judicial authorities they cannot be termed as subordinate to the higher officer and they are quite independent in performing their officials duties as adjudicating officers. This lapse render the show-cause notice and order-in-original without lawful authority and jurisdiction. Hence, ab-initio, null and void.
13.
 I am also flabbergasted to observe that respondents have charged the appellants for mis-declaration under the provision of section 32(2) of the Act, in the absence of availability of collusion, although this is without any basis, if it is presumed that their exist any collusion, that it could not be with the active connivance collusion of the Officials of MCC of Appraisement-West. Ironically, no charges have been levelled under Section 32(2) against them. I have also noticed that in similar case of M/s. Trading House, Karachi, relating to GD No. KEPW-HC-184947-23052015, contravention report was prepared, which was rejected upon conduction of 2nd examination report, on the basis of which assessment order was passed to the contrary, in the case of appellant contravention was framed for adjudication proceeding despite standing on the same pedestal as of appellant. This act of the respondents proves that the appellant has been met out with partial and different treatment in negation of Articles 4 and 25 of Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The High Court of Sindh in its reported judgment 2002 PTD 976 held that ""vacating the show-cause notice in one case and taking action against another person in similar situation, is amount to discrimination which is hit by Article 25"". In reported judgment 2002 SCMR 312 and 2009 PTD 1507 the Hon'ble Superior Courts ""there exist no power to target incidence of tax in such a way that similarly placed person be dealt not only this similarly, but discriminatingly"". Whereas, in reported judgment 2005 SCMR 492 the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that ""A facility allowed to some one and denied to other is discrimination"". The Apex Court further held in reported judgment 2010 SCMR 431 that:
""doctrine of equality, as contained in Art. 25 of the constitution, enshrine golden rules of Islam and states that every citizen, no matter how high so ever, must be accorded equal treatment with similarly situated persons--- State may classify persons and objects for the purpose of legislation and make laws applicable only to persons or objects within a class--- In fact all legislations involve some kind of classification whereby some people acquire rights or suffer disabilities whereas others do not--- What however, is prohibited under principle of reasonable classification, is legislation favouring some within a class and unduly burdening others-- Basic rule for exercise of such discretion and reasonable classification is that all persons laced in similar circumstances must be treated alike and reasonable classification must be based on reasonable grounds in given set of circumstances but the same in any case must not offend spirit of Art. 25 of the Constitution.""
14.
 For the foregoing reasons and in the light of prescribed law and evidences, the instant appeal is allowed and I, hold that the subject goods, in terms of description and HS Codes, are to be assessed as per the appellant importer's declaration and consequently the Order-in-Original, impugned by the appellants, and the Show-Cause Notice providing the basis thereof are hereby set-aside with no order as to costs.
15. 
 Order passed and announced accordingly.

40,"MUHAMMAD IQBAL Versus GOVERNMENT OF KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA through Secretary to Government, Finance Department, Peshawar","June 8, 2017",PESHAWAR HIGH COURT, Honorable Justice Muhammad Younis Thaheem ,2018 PLC(CS)N 174,"JUDGMENT
 MUHAMMAD YOUNIS THAHEEM, J.---
Through this single judgment we propose to decide the instant writ petition along with connected W.P. No.1418-P/2014 titled 
Molvi Muhammad and 4 others v. Government of KPK through Secretary Education (E&S), Peshawar and others
 and W.P. No.2053-P/2014 titled 
Saeed Ullah and 32 others v. Government of KPK through Secretary S&GAD and others
, as in all above petitions common question of law and facts regarding non-granting of two advance increments on attaining higher educational qualifications, granted under Notification No. FD(PRC)1-1/89 dated 11.08.1991 Paragraph 5 are involved. Brief facts of the instant writ petition and connected petitions are separately given below:
i)
 
W.P. No.913-P/2014:
 The petitioners served in police department and retired as Inspectors, claimed above said relief after attaining higher educational qualifications by acquiring LL.B Degrees, they filed W.P. No.3600/2010 which was allowed by this Court vide judgment dated 28.10.2010 and were declare entitled for the benefit of two advance increments already given to other civil servants but inspite of favourable judgment of this Court in their favour, the petitioners were refused relief, therefore, they filed contempt of Court petition bearing C.O.C. No.201-P/2013, wherein this Court after hearing the parties passed an order for the implementation of judgment instead Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Cessation of Payment of Arrears on Advance Increments on Higher Educational Qualification Act IX, 2012 was promulgated, which has been challenged on the ground that it is to nullify the effects of judgment dated 28.10.2010 in W.P. No.3600/2010 titled as 
Muhammad Iqbal and others v. Provincial Police Officers, K.P.K Police and others
 by giving it retrospective effect from 01.12.2001 so to the extent of retrospectivity given in Section 2 of the ibid impugned Act is liable to be truck down.
ii)
 
W.P. No.1418-P/2014:
The petitioners are employees of Education Department working on the posts of AT and TT who attained Master Degrees during service, so claimed same relief as were deprived, so filed W.P. No.1791/2009 which was decided by this Court vide order dated 08.09.2009 with the direction to decide the matter of advance increments within 03 months, but respondents gave deaf ear to the grievance of the petitioners rather to make the aforesaid judgment as effectless, promulgated enactment known as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Cessation of Payment of Arrears on Advance Increments on Higher Educational Qualification Act-IX of 2012 which is ineffective upon the rights of petitioners, so be declared as null and void and its retrospectivity given in section 2 be expunged.
iii)
 
W.P. No.2053-P/2014:
 The petitioners in the above referred petition are provincial government civil servants in different capacity from BPS-1 to BPS-15 in the education department who also during service attained higher qualifications, so sought relief provided vide notification dated 11.08.1991. The petitioners approached respondent No.4 by filing representation/departmental appeal for the grant of two advance increments but their said representation has not been considered but took shelter in the notification dated 03.01.2009 which contemplates as following: 
 ""Now it has been decided that those who are although entitled but have not availed the same facilities so far will not be given advance increments in future""
but said notification dated 03.01.2009 has been declared discriminatory and violative of law by Honourable Supreme Court in judgments passed in C.P.L.A. No.525 of 2007 titled as 
Rashid Iqbal Khan v. District Coodination Officer, Abbottabad and others
 and C.P.L.A. No.526 of 2007 titled as 
Muhammad Haroon Qureshi v. District Coodination Officer, Abbottabad and others
 decided on 19.07.2007. Moreover, the petitioners have also challenged the vires of ibid KPK Act IX of 2012.
2.
 The petitioners in all the above said petitions have invoked the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court for the relief regarding grant of two advance increments on attaining higher educational qualifications and in this regard the notification dated 03.01.2009 has been set aside in W.P. No.368/2009. Petitioners have also challenged the vires of K.P.K Cessation of Arrears on Advance Increments on Higher Educational Qualification (hereinafter called impugned Act IX of 2012) to the extent of giving it retrospective effect before 01.12.2001 as against law with prayer to declare it null and void and it be expunged to the extent of retrospectivity.
3.
 Comments from respondents were called who submitted the same wherein they took stance that the petitioners have no any vested rights in view of notification dated 03.01.2009 and new enactment said K.P.K. Cessation of Arrears Act IX of 2012 and notification dated 03.01.2009. Respondents contended that the existing scheme of advance increments has been discontinued w.e.f. 03.01.2009 and vide section 2 of ibid impugned Act before 01.12.2001 and have given it retrospective effect which is within legislative powers of Pakhtunkhwa Assembly.
4.
 The learned counsel for the petitioners argued that issuance of notification dated 03.01.2009 and giving retrospective effect to the impugned enactment K.P.K. Cessation Act, 2012 is only aimed to nullify the beneficial effects of judgment of this Court in W.P. No.3600/2010 vide which notification dated 03.01.2009 has been set aside by this Court and by Honourable Supreme Court in above mentioned CPLAs decided on 19.07.2007, so this Court can examine the constitutionality of the piece of legislation by ibid impugned section 2 of K.P.K. Cessation Act IX of 2012 to the extent of giving it retrospective effect. He added that so many civil servants of provincial government had been benefited earlier from the notification dated 11.08.1991 but petitioners have been deprived, so the impugned enactment is mala fide to nullify the judgment of this Court and prayed for striking it down to the extent of section 2 of impugned ibid Act by giving it retrospective effect before 01.12.2001.
5.
 On the other hand learned counsel for the respondents supported the impugned notification dated 03.01.2009, relied on their comments and impugned Act. He further argued that this enactment is neither aimed at to nullify the judgment of this Court nor that of Honourable Supreme Court. He lastly argued that petitioners are not entitled for the advance increments due to aforesaid notification dated 03.01.2009 and ibid impugned Act IX of 2012.
6.
 Arguments heard and record perused.
7.
 From the perusal of record it is admitted position that vide paragraph 5 of the notification dated 11.08.1991 issued by Finance Department, it was provided that any civil servant of Provincial Government Department who attained higher qualifications during service, would be entitled for two advance increments and due to said notification admittedly so many civil servants had already been benefited. However, above said relief has not been extended to petitioners despite of representations to their higher competent authorities and judgment passed by this Court as well as by Honourable Supreme Court particularly in W.P. No.1791/2009 decided on 08.09.2009 vide which direction was given to the respondents to decide the representation of the petitioners within 03 months but neither the respondents have decided the matter nor given said advance increments, on this inaction, petitioner filed COC Petition No.133/2010 which was disposed of vide order dated 11.10.2012 as abated in the light of impugned Act, IX of 2012 known as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Cessation of Payment of Arrears on Advance Increments on Higher Educational Qualification Act, 2012 in the light of provision by giving it retrospective effect before 01.12.2001, so the petitioners feeling aggrieved have challenged the vires of above said notification and impugned enactment to the extent of giving it retrospective effect.
8.
 In brief the reliefs sought by the petitioners in all petitions is, one for the grant of two advance increments in purview of notification dated 11.08.1991, second for the implementation of beneficial judgments in W.P. No.368/2009 dated 24.03.2009 and W.P. No.3600/2010 dated 28.10.2010 and in third to declare the retrospective effect of impugned ibid Act, IX of 2012 as null and void and for expunction.
9.
 The question for determination before this Court is as to whether impugned enactment passed by the Pakhtunkhwa Assembly with legislative nomenclature as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Cessation of Payment of Arrears on Advance Increments on Higher Educational Qualification Act, IX of 2012 is to nullify the effects of aforesaid judgments passed by this Court and to annul the beneficial effects of notification dated 11.08.1991 from which earlier so many civil servants of different departments of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have been benefited.
10.
 We examined the impugned notification dated 03.01.2009 and whole of impugned ibid Act IX of 2012 by giving it retrospective effect before 01.12.2001. A query was put to the learned counsel for respondents as to whether before promulgation of impugned Act, its cause was removed and as whether that same provision in the impugned legislation would not amount to nullify the effects of judgment passed by this Court in the light of judgment of Honourable Apex Court cited as 2013 SCMR 1752, on this learned counsel for the respondents failed to provide some reasonable and rational explanation for giving the impugned Act as retrospective effect before 01.12.2001. The Honourable Supreme Court while taking cognizance about the anomaly and miscarriage of justice caused to other civil servants in the Sindh Province for giving out of turn promotions by way of deputation and absorption of different officers in the province of Sindh through legislation by way of amending Sindh Civil Servants (Amendment) Act, 2013 and Sindh Civil Servants (Second Amendment) Act, 2013 but said piece of enactment in aforesaid enactment through amendment was struck down in the referred judgment i.e. 2013 SCMR 1752 (Contempt Proceedings case).
11.
 In the above cited judgment the Honourable Supreme Court held that Supreme Court either on its own or on petition by party is vested with the judicial power to examine, review and expunge the vires of such piece of legislation/amendment relating to the rights of civil servants and having public importance.
12.
 The Honourable Supreme Court vide above said judgment set aside the piece of legislation promulgated by the Sindh Assembly with regard to out of turn promotions of some officers by way of deputation /absorption. In the said judgment certain principles have been enunciated regarding instruments/piece of legislation which had nullified the effects of the judgments passed by Honourable Apex Court as well as of Honourable Sindh High Court. In this respect paragraphs Nos.165, 166 and 167 of said cited judgment are reproduced below:
 165. The leading judgment on the subject issue, which our Courts have approvingly referred to the case of 
Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narain
 (AIR 1975 SC 2299) which relates to amendment in the Election Laws of India. In the said judgment Paras 190 and 191 are importance and reproduced hereunder:-
 ""190. A declaration that an order made by a Court of law is void is normally part of the judicial function and is not a legislative function 
 191. The position as it prevails in the United States, where guarantee of due process of law is in operation, is given on pages 318-19 of Vol. 46 of the American jurisprudence 2d as under:
 ""The general rule is that the legislature may not destroy, annul set aside, vacate, reverse, modify, or impair the final judgment of a Court of competent jurisdiction, so as to take away private rights which have become vested by the judgment. A statute attempting to do so has been held unconstitutional as an attempt on the part of the legislature to exercise judicial power, and as to violation of the constitutional guarantee of due process of law. The legislature is not only prohibited from reopening cases previously decided by the Courts, but is also forbidden to affect the inherent attributes of a judgment. That the statute is under the guise of an act affecting remedies does not alter the rule. It is worthy of notice, however, that there are cases in which judgments requiring acts to be done in the future may validly be affected by subsequent legislation making illegal that which the judgment found to be illegal, or making legal that which the judgment found to be illegal.""
13.
 Similarly Paragraphs Nos.166 and 167 of the cited judgment (2013 SCMR 1749) are reproduced as under:
 ""166. This Court in the case of 
Fecto Belarus Tractor Ltd. v. Government of Pakistan through Finance Economic Affairs and others
 (PLD 2005 SC 605) has held that when a legislature intends to validate the tax declared by a Court to be illegally collected under an individual law, the cause for ineffectiveness or invalidity must be removed before the validation can be said to have taken place effectively .
 167. In order to nullify the judgment of the Court, 
unless basis for judgment in favour of a party is not removed, it could not affect the rights of a party in whose favour the same was passed.
 The issue of effect of nullification of judgment has already been discussed in the case of Mobashir Hassan reported in (PLD 2010 SC 265), Para-76 discusses the effect of nullification of a judgment by means of a legislation. In the said case, the view formed is identical to the one in the case of 
Indira Nehro Gandhi v. Raj Narain
 (AIR 1975 SC 2299) and 
Fecto Belarus Tractor Ltd. v. Government of Pakistan through Finance Economic Affairs and others
 (PLD 2005 SC 605) and it was observed that the legislature cannot nullify the effect of the judgment and there are certain limitations placed on its powers including the one i.e. by amending the law 
with retrospective effect on the basis of which the order or judgment has been passed thereby removing basis of the decision.
""
 (Underlining are ours for emphasis)
14.
 In the petitions in hand the Government of Pakhtunkhwa by means of issuing notification dated 03.01.2009 had nullified the effect of notification dated 11.08.1991 and same notification dated 03.01.2009 had been declared null and void by this Court in judgment passed in W.P. No.3600/2010 dated 28.10.2010 and Honourable of Supreme Court in above referred C.P.L.As. No.525 and 526 of 2007. So the petitioners were and are entitled for the benefits arising out of notification dated 11.08.1991 and the judgments passed by this Court, therefore, respondents were not legally authorized to deprive the petitioners from the beneficial effects of the aforesaid notification dated 11.08.1991 and aforesaid judgments through impugned ibid Act, IX of 2012 before first removing the cause that is entitlement and the aforesaid beneficial effects of judgments in the impugned notification dated 03.01.2009 and through the impugned ibid Cessation of Advance Increments Act IX of 2012.
15.
 Thus in view of above discussion, we are of the firm view that by promulgating impugned piece of legislation and giving it retrospective effect is nothing but to destroy, annul and make the judgments of this Court as well as of Honourable Supreme Court as effectless, therefore, to the extent of section 2 by giving it retrospective effect before 1.12.2001 is declared null and void so is hereby expunged and struck down from the aforesaid impugned Act IX of 2012. Hence, these petitions are allowed and the respondents are directed to provide them the benefits of two advance increments according to notification dated 11.08.1991 on attaining higher qualifications during service within the period of two months from the receipt of this judgment according to prescribed manner under the law then in field.

41,FAZAL MEHMOOD BAIG Versus UNIVERSITY OF AZAD JAMMU AND KASHMIR,"June 8, 2017",SUPREME COURT AZAD KASHMIR," Honorable Justice Ch. Muhammad Ibrahim Zia, C.J. and Raja Saeed Akram Khan ",2017 PLD 50,"JUDGMENT
 RAJA SAEED AKRAM KHAN, J.---
The titled appeal by leave of the Court has been directed against the judgment passed by the High1Court on 26.5.2016, whereby, the writ petition filed by the appellant, herein, has been dismissed.
2.
 The facts in brief as stated are that the appellant, herein, filed a writ petition in the High Court, alleging therein, that he is Ex-Secretary General, Bar Association, Muzaffarabad and believe in the supremacy of law, protection of the fundamental rights of State-Subjects, especially, the Health, Education, Environmental protection and liberty of speech. It has been alleged that he filed the writ petition to realize the State functionaries with regard to their obligations and duties. The Chancellor of Azad Jammu and Kashmir University advertised the post of Vice Chancellor in daily newspaper 'Daily Jang' on 29.3.2016 through the President Secretariat. It is averred that the presidential Secretariat under the AJ&K Rules of Business, 1985 has no jurisdiction, to issue such like advertisement. He prayed for setting aside the advertisement dated 29.3.2016 and letter dated 22.3 2016 and the order dated 8.7.2015 through which a Search Committee has been constituted. After necessary proceedings, the learned High Court dismissed the writ petition vide impugned judgment dated 26.5.2016, which is the subject-matter of this appeal.
3.
 Sardar Karam Dad Khan, Advocate, the learned counsel for the appellant, submitted that the learned High Court while holding that the appellant is not an aggrieved person failed to resolve the factual as well as the legal proposition involved in the matter. He further submitted that the act of the respondents will cause the effects upon the whole society, therefore, he challenged the same being citizen of the State. He contended that the statutory provisions of section 10 of the AJ&K University Act, 1985 are ambiguous and arbitrary, therefore the same cannot be given preference over the Constitutional provisions which are the supreme law of the land. He further contended that under the provision of section 7 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act, 1974, the Presidential Secretariat has got no authority to issue the advertisement or to process the case for appointment of Vice Chancellor without any advice of the Prime Minister. He added that the learned High Court has travelled beyond its jurisdiction while issuing the recommendation to the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Bar Council for amendment of the rules. The learned counsel submitted that the learned High Court while delivering the impugned judgment has passed the unnecessary remarks regarding the conduct of the appellant, therefore, the learned High Court has travelled beyond the pleadings of the parties. He argued that the education is one of the fundamental rights of the state-subjects coupled with other constitutionally guaranteed fundamental rights. The University of Azad Jammu and Kashmir is a public institute, therefore, the appointment of the Vice chancellor without lawful authority can infringe the interest of the state-subjects and their future generations. He contended that under law it is the sole discretion of the Chancellor to appoint or remove the Vice Chancellor and determine his terms and conditions, whereas, such unguided powers are not recognised in any civilized society. He submitted that such arbitrary powers of Chancellor exercised by him without advice of the Prime Minister is departure from the Constitutional provisions. The Chancellor being the President has to act on the advice of the Prime Minister who is responsible and answerable before the public through elected representatives at the forum of the Assembly. The learned counsel has relied upon the cases reported as Rana Aamer Raza Ashfaq and another v. Dr. Minhaj Ahmad Khan and another [2012 SCMR 61], and Begum Nusrat Ali Gonda v. Federation of Pakistan and others [PLD 2013 SC 829].
4.
 On the other hand, Mr. Farooq Hussain Kashmiri, Advocate, the learned counsel for respondents Nos. 1 and 3, argued that the judgment passed by the learned High Court is perfect and legal, therefore, no interference is called for by this Court. He further argued that the appellant does not fall within the definition of aggrieved person and he has no locus standi to file the writ petition before the learned High Court, therefore, the appeal is liable to be dismissed on this sole ground. He argued that none of the rights of the appellant have been infringed whereas, only aggrieved person can file the writ petition for the protection of basic fundamental Constitutional rights. He contended that the advertisement dated 20.3.20116 and the appointment notification of the Vice Chancellor dated 28.7.2015 have been issued under section 10 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir University Act, 1985, therefore, no illegality, has been committed by the learned High Court while passing the impugned judgment.
5.
 Mr. Muhammad Zubair Raja, Additional Advocate-General, while appearing on behalf of respondent No. 2, supported the arguments of the learned counsel for respondents Nos.1 and 3. He submitted that the powers to appoint the Vice Chancellor are based on the relevant rules and the vires of the same cannot be challenged until and unless the same are inconsistent with the Constitution, whereas, no eventuality is available in this case. He has relied upon the cases reported as Raja Iqbal Rashid Minhas v. AJ&K Council and 3 others [PLD 2002 SC (AJ&K) 1], Raja Tahir Majeed Khan and others v. Azad Government and 6 others [2014 SCR 272].
6.
 We have heard the arguments of the learned counsel for the parties and the learned Additional Advocate-General at some length and gone through the impugned judgment along with the record made available. The controversy involved in the matter is that the appellant, herein, challenged the letter dated 22.3 2016 issued by the Presidential Secretariat, advertisement dated 29.3.2016 and the order dated 8.7.2015 through which a Search Committee has been constituted for the appointment of Vice Chancellor of the University of Azad Jammu and Kashmir. The claim of the appellant was that section 10 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir University Act, 1985 is ambiguous which confers the arbitrary powers to the President/Chancellor to make the appointment of the Vice Chancellor.
7.
 The learned High Court has given the main thrust on the question of maintainability of the writ petition and held that the same has been filed incompetently by a person who does not come within the definition of an aggrieved person. Thus, we also intend to attend this aspect of the case at first. During the course of argument, the learned counsel for the appellant was confronted that how he is an aggrieved person within the ambit of section 44 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act, 1974, he submitted that the appellant being an advocate believes in the supremacy of law and Constitution. The act of the Presidential Secretariat while issuing letter dated 22.3.2016 and advertisement dated 29.3.2016 and the order dated 8.7.2015, through which a Search Committee for appointment of Vice Chancellor of the University of Azad Jammu and Kashmir has been made, is in violation of the relevant law and rules. He submitted that the appellant agitated his grievance as pro bono publico before the learned High Court by challenging the vires of law.
8.
 To appreciate the argument addressed by the learned counsel for the appellant, we have given our serious thought to the relevant provisions of section 44 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act, 1974, which postulates that one can move the Court pro bono publico to challenge the vires of law on the ground that the same offends the provisions of the Constitution. The person who seeks a command from the High Court for enforcement of fundamental right must first show as to how he is an aggrieved person. A Writ can be issued only on the petition of an aggrieved person and not by a pro bono publico litigant. In other words a person whose interests have been adversely affected by the impugned legislation or order under challenge, he can competently file a writ petition and then file an appeal before the Supreme Court against the judgment of the High Court as required by law.
9.
 In the case in hand, we have failed to gather anything to ascertain that how the appellant is aggrieved by the act of respondent No. 2, herein. Neither the appellant is a candidate for the post of Vice Chancellor nor he is student of the University, therefore, no legal right of the appellant appears to be infringed. The argument of the learned counsel for the appellant that as pro bono publico he challenged the vires of the law before the learned High Court by filing writ petition, it may be observed that every person by his own sweet will, cannot file the writ petition as pro bono publico until and unless he fulfils the conditions to invoke the Constitutional jurisdiction of the High Court. The appellant while invoking such jurisdiction, has to show that he was litigating firstly, in public interest and secondly, for public good or for welfare of general public. In the case in hand, the appellant failed to show any such interest, therefore, he is not an aggrieved person. Thus, he could not invoke the Constitutional jurisdiction of the High Court as pro bono publico as laid down in a case reported as Javed Ibrahim Paracha v. Federation of Pakistan and others [PLD 2004 SC 482], wherein it has been held as under:--
""10. No doubt with the development of new concept of public interest litigation in the recent years, a person can invoke the Constitutional jurisdiction of the Superior Courts as pro bono publico but while exercising this jurisdiction, he has to show that he is litigating, firstly in the public interest and, secondly, for the public good or for the welfare of the general public.
 In a case reported as Col. (Retd.) Muhammad Akram v Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Defence, and others 1998 SCMR 2073], it has been held as under:--
""3. We are unable to subscribe to the above contention of the petitioner as the convict or his close relation could have filed the above writ petition but the petitioner has not been able to show any personal interest in the convict of the nature warranting filing of the same. The case in hand involves trial and conviction of an individual person and hence the principle of pro bono publico cannot be invoked in aid.""
 Similarly, in another case reported as Ghiasul Haq and others v. Azad Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir and others [PLD 1980 SC AJ&K 5], it has been held as under: -
""27. And if this is so the petition, as framed, was not maintainable under section 44(c) because the High Court cannot under the said constitutional provision grant a declaration simpliciter, nor anyone can move the Court pro bono publico to challenge the vires of a law on the ground that the same offends against any provision of the Constitution. The person who seeks a command from the High Court for enforcement of fundamental right must first show with reference to admitted or proved facts, as to how he is an aggrieved person; from what particular act or action he feels aggrieved, and to which authority he wishes the writ of the High Court to be directed ""
The case law referred to by the counsel for the appellant is not helpful to the case because it has distinguishable features and has nothing common with the case in hand.
10.
 In the light of what has been discussed above, we are of the unanimous view that the learned High Court has rightly held that the appellant does not fall within the definition of aggrieved person and has no locus standi to file the writ petition as pro bono publico. The findings recorded by the learned High Court are well reasoned, therefore, we are inclined to endorse the same. However, the remarks given by the learned High Court regarding the conduct of the appellant while deciding the writ petition appears to be unnecessary, therefore, the same are hereby quashed.
 This appeal stands disposed of in the terms indicated above.

 Order accordingly."
42,NAWAB ALI WASSAN Versus Syed GHOUS ALI SHAH,"June 7, 2017",SUPREME COURT, Honorable Justice Maqbool Baqar ,2018 SCMR 87,"JUDGMENT
 MAQBOOL BAQAR, J.---
The present appeal was preferred against the judgment dated 6th December, 2014 rendered in Election Petition No. 10/2013, whereby the election of the appellant was declared void under section 68(d) of The Representation of the People Act, 1976 (""ROPA""), and the respondent No. 1, who being the runner-up had filed the above Election Petition, was declared elected under section 69 of ROPA.
2.
 The brief facts of the case are that the appellant and the respondents contested election for the National Assembly seat in constituency NA-215, Khairpur, held on 11.05.2013, and as per results announced by the Election Commission of Pakistan, the appellant secured 91809 valid votes, whereas respondent No. 1 obtained 66481 votes. The vote count of the appellant being the highest and that of the respondent No.1 being the second highest, the appellant was declared the returned candidate from the constituency, and the respondent No. 1 stood as the runner-up. Not being satisfied with the result, the respondent No.1 challenged the same through the above petition on the ground that the result was obtained by the appellant by indulging in corrupt practices and exercising undue influence as defined by sections 78(2) and 81(1)(a)(b) of the ROPA respectively.
3.
 The petition so filed contained various allegations and narrated several purported stances of alleged use of force, intimidation and undue influence, such as that a DSP, namely, Munir Ahmed Phulpoto who was posted at Karachi, harassed his voters and persuaded them to vote for the appellant, and though the Returning Officer conveyed such complaint to the Inspector General of Police, Sindh but to no avail. It was also alleged that the appellant along with a few others, in order to harass, intimidate and prevent the petitioner's voters from casting their votes, resorted to aerial firing across the constituency. It was further alleged that the appellant and his accomplices have attacked and fired at one Tahir Imtiaz and some other workers of the petitioner resulting in the death of one Abdul Wahab Narejo, and injuries to a few others of which incident an FIR was also recorded. It was claimed that on 12.05.2013 the respondent No.1 submitted a complaint before the Returning Officer regarding the conduct of the appellant. It was alleged that one Ghulam Abbas, filed an application under section 22(a)(b), Cr.P.C. for registration of an FIR along with an application for medical examination of some purported injured victims, whereupon learned IInd Additional Sessions Judge, Khairpur ordered investigation into the allegations. The respondent No.1 also mentioned names of three Presiding Officers and one Assistant Presiding Officer who allegedly complained of bogus voting at Polling Station, Malir Pato and that the ballot boxes which were snatched from them were filled with bogus votes, and further that the polling staff was confined and harassed by the appellant. The respondent No.1 further alleged that the appellant also removed ballot papers from the ballot boxes and further that the ballot boxes were already stuffed with bogus votes before they were sealed for voting. A further allegation was that the entire district administration was acting on the instructions of the appellant and his uncle Mr. Manzoor Hussain Wasan who had remained Provincial Home Minister during the previous regime. The respondent No. 1 claimed that at Polling Station (Ghulam Raza, UC Lyari, Tehsil Kotdiji, Mr. Manzoor Hussain Wasan threatened and compelled respondent No.1's election agents to leave the polling station. Another allegation was that the Presiding Officer was openly supporting the appellant and that his female agents were forced to leave the polling station Technical College, Tehsil Khairpur. The incidents were reported to the District Returning Officer and the Returning Officers and to the concerned SSP and also to the Army Headquarters, by Ghulam Shabbir Dayo, the General Secretary of respondent No. 1's political party through a written complaint. The respondent No. 1 also alleged that the polling staff who sympathized with the appellant's political party, prepared fictitious results in favour of the appellant and claimed that the Form No. XIV, in respect of polling station, Government Primary School, Kumb shows that at serial No. 7 the respondent No. 1 secured 444 votes, whereas as per the consolidated result he did not secure any vote at the said polling station. It was further submitted that at polling station Government Primary School, Nawab Wassan, the respondent No.1 has been shown not to have secured any vote, whereas the number of votes attributed to the appellant at the said polling station are 1051. Similarly only 8 votes have been shown in favour of the respondent No.1 at Government Primary School, Nawab Wasan, whereas the appellant is shown to have secured 1086 votes. Another allegation is that contrary to the relevant rules, and to favour the appellant, the election results were prepared on plain papers. Alleged incidents of preventing respondent No.l's voters were narrated in the petition, in respect of polling stations Raheem Bux Wasan, Government High School-II, Khairpur, Ghulam Raza Khokhar, UC Lyari, Kouro Ghoth, Taluka Khairpur, Talpur Wada, Hakeem Chakrani and Tando Nazar Ali.
4.
 In support of his case the respondent No. 1 filed his affidavit in evidence, wherein he reiterated the contents of his petition. He also filed affidavit in evidence of seven witnesses, namely, Muhammad Khan, Mrs. Nawab Khatoon, Muhammad Shareef, Safdar Ali Shah Jehania, Nawab Khan alias Raju, Ghulam Shabbir Dayo and Karim Bakhsh Kubar. The witness Muhammad Khan deposed that he resides near Kot Pull, Taluka Khairpur and that he went to cast vote in favour of respondent No. 1, but when he refused to oblige the appellant's agents by casting vote in favour of the appellant the Presiding Officer declined to issue ballot paper to him and that he was pushed out of the polling station. However during his cross-examination he stated that he is not conversant with the English language, wherein the affidavit was written, and that the contents of the affidavit were not read out to him in Sindhi, and upon being explained the contents of his affidavit to him in Sindhi he stated that the same were not correct. The witness was thus declared hostile and was cross-examined by the counsel for the respondent No. 1, but nothing could be extracted from the witness which could be helpful to the said respondent. The witness, Nawab Khatoon deposed that on the polling day she went to polling station Kot Pull but then some persons with muffled faces entered the polling station and resorted to aerial firing which caused terror, forcing her and the other lady voters of the respondent No. 1 to leave the polling station. However during her cross-examination she stated that since the faces of the culprits were muffled she could not see their faces. The third witness, namely, Muhammad Shareef deposed that he lives near Wada Machi and that he went to Polling Station Primary School, Kot Pull for casting his vote in favour of respondent No. 1 where the appellant and his accomplices resorted to aerial firing causing terror and harassment to the petitioner's voters and thus forcing them to leave the polling station without casting their votes. However during his cross-examination he admitted that there was a separate polling station for ""Wada Machi"" (the place where the witness lives) he also admitted not having produced his voters' certificate and that he has not complained about the incident to police or any other authority.
5.
 The 4th witness Safdar Ali Shah Jahania deposed that he went to cast his vote in favour of respondent No.1 to Polling Station Middle School, Mithri, however, Munawar Wassan along with some persons belonging to the appellant's party, duly armed, came to the polling station and caused harassment and commotion, and when the said witness along with one Ghulam Abbas resisted them, the witness and Ghulam Abbas were forcibly removed and were taken away in a vehicle and confined in a godown behind Munawar Wassan's bungalow in his village where they remained confined for three days and were severely beaten by Munawar Wassan and his accomplice, resulting in injuries on the back and head of the deponent, and facture in the arm, and head of Ghulam Abbas. Whereafter Munawar Wassan handed them over to Kotdiji police who booked them in a false criminal case, which case was subsequently disposed of under cancel clause. The witness further deposed that since FIR of the above incident was not being recorded, Ghulam Abbas filed an application under section 22-A, 22-B, Cr.P.C. which was allowed and an order was also passed for their medical examination.
6.
 Similar affidavit in evidence was filed by the 5th witness namely Nawab Khan alias Raju.
7.
 The sixth (6th) witness, namely Ghulam Shabbir Dayo, General Secretary Pakistan Muslim League (N), deposed that he was deputed at the complaint centre established by respondent No. 1, where he received complaints of aerial firing, injuries to voters, bogus voting and of malpractices by the appellant, his uncle Munawar Wassan and Syed Qaim Ali Shah, at various polling stations, which were noted down by him and were conveyed to the office of the District Returning Officer, Returning Officer, Army Headquarter and also to SSP Khairpur but to of no avail.
8.
 The seventh (7th) witness, namely Karim Bakhsh Kubar deposed that he was acting as Chief Election Agent for the respondent No.1, and was assigned to attend telephone complaints regarding ensuing election and that he received complaints of aerial firing at different polling stations. He referred to different polling stations in that regard and further deposed that the appellant in collusion with the election staff, police and some criminals succeeded in obtaining bogus votes, took away ballot boxes and also created terror and harassment in order to implead the election process.
9.
 From the above resume and the evidence recorded on behalf of the petitioner it can be seen that none of the witnesses even incidentally referred to any of the polling stations regarding which respondent No.1's petition contain any allegation. The only witnesses who, have deposed in consonance with certain allegations contained in the petition to some extent are Safdar Ali Shah Jahania and Nawab Khan also Raju, however, it has nowhere been disclosed by the said witnesses or any of the other witnesses, regarding the fate of the FIR allegedly sought to be registered by the said two witnesses. Furthermore and more importantly the incident of violence as alleged by the two witnesses pertain to Polling Station Middle School, Mithri, however, absolutely no reference to or allegation in relation to said polling station, has been made by respondent No.1 in his petition, or otherwise. Even the hand notes, of the complaints received by Ghulam Shabbir Dayo does not make any mention of the Polling Station Middle School, Mithri, from where the said witnesses were allegedly abducted. Moreover neither the doctor who purportedly issued the injury/medical certificate was produced nor was the photographer who took photographs of the injured produced. We may observe here that it is unsafe to accept oral evidence at its face value, unless the same is vouched and supported by unimpeachable documentary and/or circumstantial evidence. The evidence of the said two witnesses is thus wholly irrelevant and. inconsequential, and of no avail to respondent No.1. Whereas the evidence of Ghulam Shabbir Dayo is bereft of necessary details as required by law. Similarly the affidavit in evidence of Karim Bakhsh Kubar lacks in necessary details, contain vague allegations, and the only polling station mentioned therein, namely, Govt. Primary School Khanan Buriro, where according to the witness one police constable namely Ali Gohar Wassan was handed over to Rangers, does not find mention either in the petition or in the evidence of the petitioner, or in any of his other witnesses, whereas the appellant and the co-accused in the case of murder of Abdul Wahab Mourejo and of injuries to Tahir Imtiaz Phulpoto, as mentioned by the said witness, have been acquitted, as the complainant in that case who was allegedly injured in the incident, and the other witness namely Mushtaq Jagirani did not support to the allegations contained in the FIR.
10.
 It may be noted here that in order to successfully challenge an election on the ground that the same was induced through corrupt practices, the petitioner should be conscious of the fact that the charge of corrupt practices is in the nature of a criminal charge and has to be proved beyond any shadow of doubt. The standard of proof required for establishing such charge is the same as is applicable to a criminal charge. The evidence should be absolutely credible by the standards of the appreciation applicable to criminal cases and should be able to stand the test of strict and scrupulous scrutiny. It is also now well settled that the party seeking to challenge the validity of an election should essentially specify in the election petition the incident(s) of corrupt practice with as much precision as is possible and with all necessary details and particulars. The petitioner should keep in mind that no fresh charge or incident can be introduced during the trial. The other well pronounced principle is that the evidence in proof of the alleged corrupt practices is to be restricted to the instances as set out in the petition, and in order to succeed, the petitioner has to prove such ingredient of the corrupt practice alleged, affirmatively. Statement of allegation contained in the petition should therefore be precise and should clearly contain all the necessary details as required in terms of section 55 of the ROPA.
11.
 However in the present case, as noted earlier, none of the respondent No.1's witnesses deposed regarding the alleged instance pertaining to the various polling stations, as mentioned in the petition, and the polling stations whereabout the respondent No. 1's witnesses deposed were neither mentioned in the petition nor in the affidavit of evidence of the petitioner. Such evidence is therefore wholly irrelevant, inconsequential and is liable to be ignored, and cannot be thus taken into consideration. Even otherwise the evidence recorded on behalf of the petitioner in view of the foregoing analysis of such evidence does not at all prove that the appellant indulged in any corrupt practice or resorted to any undue influence to procure his success in the election.
12.
 We may also mention here that at the request of respondent No.1, the counterfoils of the used ballot papers, the used electoral list, and the statements of counts pertaining to all the polling stations of the constituency, were sent to National Database Registration Authority (""NADRA""), for forensic examination of the thumb impressions appended to the said counterfoils and used electoral list. However, as per the NADRA report it was only in respect of 229 counterfoils that the fingerprints failed authentication whereas the fingerprints which could not be deciphered, inter alia, due to use of poor quality/inappropriate ink were 99752, however such counterfoils did bear valid CNIC numbers of the voters, and therefore, and specially so in view of the fact that the difference of votes between appellant and respondent No.1 is 25328 votes, the NADRA report does not adversely affect the success of the appellant in the election.
13.
 In view of the foregoing, absolutely no case was made out for declaring the appellant's election void under section 68(d) of the ROPA, and or declaring the respondent No.1 as elected in terms of section 69 of the ROPA. We have also found that the Presiding Officer of the Election Tribunal has failed to function within the parameters of law and has grossly misunderstood and misapplied the relevant provisions of ROPA. The judgment also miserably suffers from non-reading and misreading of evidence which resulted in miscarriage of justice.
14.
 It was for the foregoing reasons that, we, through our short order dated 07.06.2017, allowed the above appeal and set aside the order impugned thereby.

 SALAHUDDIN PANHWAR, J.---
Through instant bail application, applicant Asghar Ali seeks post arrest bail in Crime No.35/2016 registered at Police Station ANF Hyderabad, under sections 9(c), 14 and 15 of C.N.S. Act, 1997.
2.
 Precisely relevant facts are that on 27.09.2016, complainant along with his subordinate staff was present at PS where they received spy information that present applicant is bringing the huge quantity of narcotics for selling purpose. On such information, complainant along with his subordinate staff reached at the pointed place and saw the present applicant having one black shopper in his hand, who on seeing the police party tried to slip away. However, the present applicant was apprehended and during search recovery of 2.450 grams charas was affected from accused Property and accused were brought at Police Station. FIR was registered against the applicant. After usual investigation they were sent up for trial.
3.
 Learned counsel for the applicants inter alia contends that recovery affected from the applicant is 2.450 grams charas chemical report is delayed; no independent person has been cited as witness; applicant has no previous criminal record; investigation is completed; all the prosecution witnesses are police officials hence there is no question of tampering with the prosecution evidence. He lastly contended that applicant is behind the bar since last about 09 months.
4.
 Learned Special Prosecutor ANF opposed this application on the ground that this is a crime against society, however he concedes that there is no criminal history of applicant.
5.
 After careful consideration of contentions of learned counsel for the parties and meticulous examination of available record, alleged contraband narcotics is 2.450 grams charas. No private witnesses have been associated in spite of prior spy information received at the police station hence the complainant party least could have made an attempt to associate private mashirs from way or pointed place; there is a delay in sending the representative part for chemical examination which (delay) would also be required an explanation by prosecution hence making a room for further probe. Applicant has been in continuous custody since last about 09 months and are no more required for any purpose of investigation nor the prosecution has claimed any exceptional circumstance which could justify keeping the applicant behind the bars for an indefinite period. Moreover, prosecution has not claimed that the applicant is previously involved in same nature of the cases. All the prosecution witnesses are police officials hence there is no question of tampering with the evidence. Therefore, keeping peculiar facts of instant case; continuous detention of more than 09 months as well minimum punishment, which normally may be considered while dealing with bail plea, I am of the view that scale tilts in favour of the applicant for grant of bail as no useful purpose is likely to be served with further detention of applicant pending determination of his guilt.
6.
 Keeping in view the above given circumstances, prima facie, applicant has succeeded to bring his case within the purview of subsection (2) of section 497, Cr.P.C., for this reason, he is admitted to post arrest bail subject to furnishing solvent surety in the sum of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees fifty thousand) and P.R. Bond in the like amount to the satisfaction of trial Court.

According to this Act, the Board and the Executive Committee has its own functions. The Board has to formulate the policies and issued guidelines for implementation while the Executive Committee is responsible for implementation and to exercise financial and administrative powers as assigned to it. The Chief Executive Officer is the administrative head of the PEDO.
3.
 Section 5 (1) provides the criteria for appointment of Chief Executive Officer, which is reproduced as below:
""5(1). Government shall appoint the Chief Executive Officer of the Organization from amongst the persons having expertise in the field of energy and power section on such terms and conditions as the Government may determine"".
4.
 It is alleged that initially vide advertisement the post of Chief Executive Officer was advertised providing therein the qualification and experience in accordance with the PEDO Act, which is reproduced:---
 ""Candidates must hold at least Master Degree in Civil/ Electrical/Mechanical Engineering/Business Administration or C.A. Must have at least 25 years of post-qualification experience in the 
organization/companies dealing in Hydel/thermal power generation and power distribution.
i.
 5 years as head/CEO of any Power Project Construction Company/organization and proven track record of achievements.
ii.
 10 years Senior level experience in management of construction of power projects and transmission lines/Grids and distribution of power i.e. Pre-implementation, tendering contract negotiations, award of contract and its Implementations under all kinds of funding(Govt./International Donor Agencies). 
iii.
 Experience of interacting with NEPRA"".
5.
 It is alleged that again on 18.9.2014 malafidely the post of Chief Executive Officer, PEDO was re-advertized giving a completely different criteria, contrary to the Section 5(1) of the PEDO Act, 1993 Relevant para from the advertisement is reproduced:-
 ""Minimum of 15 years of experience in energy, power or Financial sectors with at least 3 years as CEO, MD, COO, CFO or Country Head in corporate entity (i.e. No.1 or 2 in corporate hierarchy) having annual turnover of more than 25 Billion"".
6.
 It is alleged that the respondent No.1 who has the political backing and close links with one Mr. Asad Umar, MNA-48 Islamabad, who is the Member of the Energy Apex Committee of this Province, was appointed in violation of merit and the criteria set in the Act ibid.
7.
 The respondents were put to notice, they filed their joint comments. Defending and denying any foul play in the matter of appointment of this important office of Chief Executive Officer. They summarized their defence in paras-3 to 5 of the comments, the same is reproduced for convenience:-
 ""Paragraphs 3 to 5 of the petition are refuted being misleading. In fact, when despite abundance of resources, SHYDO kept performing below par and miserably failed in materializing any mega projects, Government was constrained to re-examine and realign its priorities. Feedback from relevant stakeholders and interaction with other federal and provincial counterparts necessitated whole-scale changes in SHYDO. Not only an immediate need was felt to restructure and reorganize this floundering Organization but it was also felt that Province must harness other forms of energy and power besides merely hydro-electricity. This led the Government to bring substantial changes in SHYDO Act, 1993 through Act XIII of 2014, whereby not only the Organization was renamed to PEDO but besides restructuring the Board of PEDO many other important changes were also brought on the statute book. Bedrock and spirit of these statutory amendments were reorganizing this entity on corporate lines. It was also felt that business-as-usual would not bring any desired changes thus to foot the bills of future energy plans, Government has to run this organization through a corporate-sector led, lean Board with minimum government involvement, with a Chief Executive from corporate sector, who is capable of thinking out-of-the-box, who knows to leverage the resources well and has mastery to attract more and more investment through his connectivity and abilities of showcasing projects with potentials to maximize profits for government.
4.
 Para 6 of the petition needs elaboration. Criterion advertised through advertisement dated 04.04.2014 was prepared prior to promulgation of Act XIII of 2014 and was already in process of publication on 02.04.2014 when the Act received asset of the Governor and was accordingly notified. Criterion had no legal backing or mandate as PEDO Act, 1993 (as amended) does not postulate such cumbersome eligibility. Even otherwise, Board and the HR Committee and of reorganized PEDO was looking for a dynamic and talented individual with demonstrable expertise to run PEDO on corporate lines so that he may take PEDO to pinnacle of success besides coming up with out-of-box solutions to meet the outlay of hundreds of billions to execute the energy plan of the Province, especially when the Provincial coffers are grossly insufficient to meet such sizable fiscal requirements. This led the Board to go for a fresh round of advertisement. In case of any grievance against Board decision, petitioner or for that matter any of the candidates could have challenged such decision before competent forum.
5.
 Paragraphs 7 to 9 are vehemently denied being nothing but willful distortion and misstatements. The process of re-advertisement and consequent selection were open, fair and transparent. Respondent No.2, while substantially fulfilling the requirements of amended section 5(1) and while keeping in view required skill set for a corporative PEDO sought candidates having required expertise in energy and/or finance. Respondent No.1, who happens to have one of the shiniest profiles and a resplendent profile as corporate guru with sufficient experience of energy and power while working with another affiliate concern of E&P Department and Engro group, known for their energy exploits in Sindh applied for the post of CEO and after going through a long winded and thoroughly scrutinizing process, got recommended for appointment of the Board. The entire process was ensured to meet the highest standards of merits and was kept insulated from strongest of pressures and influences asserted by certain elements to perpetuate vested interest as well as to induct stereotypical incumbents with no corporate skills. Respondent No.2 clearly fulfills the criterion laid down in law. He was promised market-based salary at the time of hiring as per Board decision, in view of his multi-national exposure and his feats on top management positions both in country and abroad (at Japan, Papau New genie and Singapore). Petitioner has no legal right, character or entitlement to challenge either the appointment or for that matter the salary setting process of the respondent No.2"".
8.
 Learned counsel for the petitioner referred to para 5(1) of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Energy Development Organization Act, 1993 duly up-dated and amended vide PEDO (Amendment Act, 2014) and contended that this subsection is the only pre-requisite under the law for appointment against this public post of Chief Executive Officer and the plain reading of this subsection suggest that expert only in the field of Energy and Power sector would qualify to be appointed as Chief Executive Officer (PEDO). He argued that the authority of the government to appoint the Chief Executive Officer is structured one and confined within the four corners of law. Learned counsel for the petitioner then referred to the initial advertisement issued on 4.4.2014 and argued that there the qualification and experience mentioned placed emphasis on dealing with Hydel/Thermal Power Generation and Power Distribution but the amended advertisement dated 18.9.2014 introduced a complete different criteria for the appointment of Chief Executive Officer, wherein experience in financial sector was included as a substitute for the experience in energy and power. Learned counsel further argued that the respondents themselves carried out a short-listing process in which the respondent No.1 was placed at Sr. No.5 from amongst the (18) eligible candidates. However, having certain background of affiliation with an MNA and prominent leader of the Ruling Party of the Province, was preferred over the better candidates and appointed him. Learned counsel referred to the bio-data of the respondent No.1, wherein he claimed to have remained as Senior Business Analyst, Finance and Planning of Engro Chemical Pakistan Limited allegedly owned by the said MNA. Learned counsel argued that where the respondent No.1 was appointed in violation of law and was having no lawful authority to hold the post of Chief Executive Officer, the petitioner who is low paid employee of the respondent/organization, is merely placing information before this Court to proceed in the matter. He lastly argued that the appointment of respondent No.1 need to be strucked down to upheld the rule of law.
9.
 Learned Advocate General referred to the appointment letter of the respondent No.1 dated 18.2.2015 and argued that the Provincial Government is empowered to appoint the Chief Executive Officer of the Pakhtunkhwa Energy Development Organization on contract basis, because section 5(1) of the PEDO Act, 1993 empowered the Government to appoint on such terms and conditions as it may determined. Learned AG argued that the writ petition is filed for ulterior motives and referred to certain paras of the writ petition to contend that the petitioner's main grievance seems to be apprehending some service risk on the appointment of respondent No.1. He lastly argued that where there is mala fide on the part of the petitioner or personal interest, the writ of quo warranto cannot be entertained and placed reliance on 2004 SCMR 1299 and argued that on the touch stone of the judgment of the Apex Court, this writ petition is liable to be dismissed. 
10.
 Mr. Shumail Ahmad Butt, learned counsel representing the respondent No.1 argued that though the main emphasis of qualification is on experience in energy and power sector, but these sectors also include specialized person in financial matters, and therefore, the respondent No.1 having a vast experience in financial matters by referring to his bio-data contended that he fulfilled the criteria for appointment as mentioned in the PEDO Act, 1993. Learned counsel for respondent No.1 argued that despite the fact that this province had the potential of generation of about 4000 MW Electricity but the previous Regime for almost three decades could not even tape up to 100 MW. Learned counsel for respondent No.1 argued that on the appointment of the respondent No.1 a series of projects were initiated and are near completion. Learned counsel also referred to the CV of respondent No.1 and argued that the petitioner also remained Chief Finance Officer of KP Oil and Gas Company Limited and major financial and industrial concerns of this country. Learned counsel for the respondent No.1 argued that the energy and power cannot be taken in its restrictive sense, he referred to the definition given to the power in subsection xii of section 2 of the PEDO Act, 1993 whereby ""power"" includes hydraulic power, electrical, energy, steam, gas, thermal generation, alternative renewable sources of energy. He thus argued that merely a candidate having potential in Hydel cannot run the post and a dynamic candidate having expertise in all fields including power and finance could better run this public office. Learned counsel lastly argued that the Provincial Government has rightly exercised its authority and appointed respondent No.1 in the public interest. He also referred to different averments of the petition and contended that there is extreme mala fide on the part of the petitioner in questioning the appointment of respondent No.1, thus the writ petition is not maintainable.
11.
 Arguments heard and record perused.
12.
 This petition is filed under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 sub-article (b) (ii) of Article 199 deal with the writ of quo warranto. No doubt, that the issuance of writ under Article 199 of the constitution are discretionary but it is equally true that under the mandate of Article 199, it is not necessary that a person seeking writ of quo warranto must be aggrieved and no such restriction could be placed when Article 199 allow specifically. The Apex Court of this country held in so many judgments that where a petitioner simply laid information before the High Court regarding illegal appointments, he should not necessarily be aggrieved person. We are fortified in our view by the dictum laid down by the Apex Court in the following cases PLD 1974 SC 228, PLD 1975 SC 244, 1981 SCMR 74, PLD 1989 SC 166, 1998 SCMR 996, 2004 SCMR 1299 and 2007 SC 52.
13.
 Merely for the reason that the petitioner is an employee of the respondent/Organization cannot be considered as his mala fide, because the main averments are about the ineligibility of the respondent No.1 violation of law, and appointment of ineligible candidate on the post of Chief Executive Officer, PEDO, thus we only considered this writ petition as an information placed by the petitioner before this Court and held this petition as maintainable. Now coming to the basic question regarding the eligibility of the respondent No.1 to the post Chief Executive Officer, section 5 (1) of the PEDO Act, 1993 provides that the government shall appoint the Chief Executive Officer of the Organization from amongst the persons having expertise in the field of energy and power sector on such terms and conditions as the government may determine. There are two parts of this section, first; the one deal with the basic eligibility for the post of Chief Executive Officer while the second portion deal with the terms and conditions as may be agreed with the candidate or appointee or set by the government. Section 10 of the Act ibid prescribed the general powers and duties of the organization and framing of schemes. Subsection (2) of section 10 identifies the schemes on which the PEDO will focus i.e. i- the generation, transmission and distribution of power, ii-the construction, maintenance and preparation of power houses, grids and micro grids, transmission and distribution lines, specially in the remote mountainous areas of the province.
14.
 Keeping in view the powers and duties of the organization. Section 5 (1) of section 5 considers only those persons eligible who have expertise in the field of energy and power sector. The respondents have admitted that the respondent No.1 was expert in financial matter, the detail of which has been enumerated in his bio-data which was referred by both the parties. We found that the reference of the learned counsel for respondent No.1 to his position as Finance Officer of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Oil and Gas Company Limited is mis-placed as it suggests that he was posted against the said post in September, 2014 while the advertisement for the Chief Executive Officer PEDO was also published on 18.9.2014. We thus found that the expert on financial matters can never be a substitute for expert in energy and powers both are completely different fields, because section 2(xii) defines ""power"" includes hydraulic power, electrical energy, steam, gas, thermal generation, alternative renewable sources of energy"". The plain reading of the definition no where suggest to include any financial matter, similar is the case of energy the same is not defined in the PEDO Act, 1993 and where it is not so defined we can conveniently refer to its dictionary meaning given in Concise Oxford English Dictionary 11th Edition it defines energy as (i) the strength and vitality require for sustained activity ii) power derived from physical or chemical resources to provide light and heat or to work machine and iii) the property of matter and radiation which is manifest as a capacity to perform work.
15.
 We have before us also the record of the appointment process which provides that about (122) candidates applied for the position of Chief Executive Officer PEDO, of which (18) candidates were considered eligible and short-listed. Four candidates were given grand total of 55 marks while the respondent No.1 and remaining 14 candidates were given 52 scores. Interestingly in those short-listed candidates, there are other potential candidates, who have their experience both in energy and power and finances but the respondent No.1 was picked, having only experience in finances and then appointed to this very important post.
16.
 There is no cavil with the proposition that the Courts cannot assume the role of selection authority to determine the fitness of a candidate to be appointed to a particular post, but here the situation is completely different, the process of appointment to the post of Chief Executive Officer is in violation of merit, and that the basic ineligibility of the respondent No.1, whereby he cannot even be short-listed for the position of Chief Executive Officer. Merely because advertisement was manipulated to bring this candidate within the ambit of eligibility criteria would be of no help to him, where the parent law did not consider him to be eligible. The news reports and other documents placed on file by the petitioner though cannot be substantiated but in the background explained above; wherein ineligible candidate was selected, strengthen this contention that it was for extraneous consideration and political manoeuvring in appointing the respondent No.1 to the post of Chief Executive Officer.
17.
 In PLD 2011 SC 516, the Apex Court refused leave against the judgment of the High Court, whereby out of turn promotion of an Executive Engineer was strucked down in a writ of quo warranto. In PLD 2010 SC 817, the selection of a candidate to the parliament was strucked down for holding fake degree. In PLD 2016 SC 961, the appointments made in the Islamabad High Court in violation of merit and rules was strucked down by the Apex court, 2007 SCMR 97 and 1991 SCMR 2234, the judgments of High Court striking down the appointment of Secretary Pakistan Tobacco Board and Secretary Karachi Joint Water Board which were made in violation of law and rules were maintained.
18.
 The nutshell of the above discussion is, the notification dated 18.2.2015 regarding the appointment of respondent No.1 as Chief Executive Officer Pakhtunkhwa Energy Development Organization is declared as illegal without lawful authority and is strucked down, and declare the post of Chief Executive Officer Pakhtunkhwa Energy and Development Organization (PEDO) as vacant and direct the respondent to fill the post of Chief Executive Officer strictly in accordance with law.

 M. TABASSUM AFTAB ALVI, C.J.---
 The supra titled writ petition has been addressed under section 44 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act, 1974, whereby, following relief is made:---
 ""In the circumstances enumerated above, it is humbly prayed that by accepting this constitutional petition, high Prerogative writs of mandamus, prohibition and others deemed expedient in the interest of justice, may kindly be issued directing respondents to finally settle the long standing issue of petitioner's service, by implementing and giving effect to the final orders of the competent authority/Prime Minister dated 26.10.2014, bearing No.P.M Secretariat 5821 dated 27.10.2014, and issue retrospective promotion order of petitioner, besides his reinstatement in service and superannuating retirement from service notifications w.e.f. 27.09.2009.

Any other relief of which the humble petitioner is found entitled to in the estimation of this Hon'ble Court in justice, law and equity is also solicited on his behalf along with costs of litigation.""
2.
 Precise facts of the case are that petitioner was serving as Secretary to Government in BPS-20. It is averred that competent authority/Prime Minister Azad Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir, approved promotion of petitioner as Senior Member Board of Revenue BPS-21, equivalent to post of Additional Chief Secretary General, i.e. from date of retirement of one Khalil Ahmed Qureshi, (the then SMBR), vide notification dated 02.12.1997, w.e.f. 16.05.1997. The said promotion order of petitioner was passed downwards to Chief Secretary/Secretary Services and General Administration Department, for implementation and issuance of formal notification as in those days there was no requirement or necessity of routing matter of promotion to posts of BPS-21, through Selection Board. The respondents instead of issuing formal notification, the decades back implemented and acted upon notifications of promotions of petitioner against the posts of Secretary to Government B-20, D.G. Information B-20, Director Information B-19, Deputy Director Information B-18, and Assistant Director B-17, were retrospectively recalled and ultimately he was dismissed from grade B-16, vide notification dated 01.04.1998. As all the aforesaid promotion notifications of petitioner were rescinded, who was also dismissed from service, hence, he constrained to challenge the said Government notification through Writ Petition No.215/1998, titled ""
Mujahid Husain Naqvi v. Azad Government and others
"", before this Court, which was accepted vide order dated 05.10.1999. The aforesaid order of this Court dated 05.10.1999, was challenged by respondents before the Supreme Court, in which, difference of opinion arose between two Hon'ble Judges of the Apex Court, resultantly, matter was placed before third Judge, who was at the then time, the Hon'ble Chief Justice (Mr. Justice Sardar Said Muhammad Khan). However, on application of petitioner, the learned Chief Justice, declined to hear the case, hence, the order of this Court was declared to be the judgment of the Supreme Court. It is alleged that Prime Minister of the time, granted sanction/approval for issuance of notification of reinstatement in service of petitioner in B-21, vide order dated 19.09.2009. It is further alleged that the Prime Minister also reaffirmed promotion order of petitioner in B-21, earlier passed on 02.12.1997. It is claimed that in the meantime, a bureaucratic conspiracy was hatched against petitioner by some interested persons and aforesaid order of the Prime Minister dated 19.09.2009, was recalled in so-called review, which was not competent because earlier orders were also passed upon review petition. It is contended that the learned Acting Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, as third Judge, dismissed the appeal filed by Government vide order dated 08.05.2010. Thereafter, number of orders were obtained by petitioner from the competent authority/Chief Executive of the State, for his reinstatement and retirement from service, which were revoked in sheer violation of law. It is stated that despite all obstacles petitioner was able to obtain new order from the Prime Minister on 26.10.2014, which was not implemented by respondents for mala fide reasons, hence, the instant constitution petition.
3.
 The writ petition has been resisted by respondents Nos.1 to 3 through comments, wherein, it is stated that petitioner was serving as Secretary to Government B-20, who tampered orders of the Prime Minister, against which, an inquiry was conducted as per the AJ&K Civil Servants (Efficiency and Discipline) Rules, 1977. After detailed inquiry, petitioner was reverted to lower rank and finally he was dismissed from service. The petitioner approached to this Court through writ petition No.215/1998, titled ""
Mujahid Hussain Naqvi v. Azad Government and others
"", which was accepted vide order dated 05.10.1999. Against the aforesaid order respondents filed an appeal before the Apex Court, however, the order passed by this Court was maintained vide judgment dated 09.09.2009. Against the aforesaid judgment dated 09.09.2009, a review petition was filed by respondents before the Apex Court, hence, while accepting review petition, appeal of Govt. was restored vide order dated 11.05.2011. It is maintained that the Supreme Court ultimately while accepting appeal filed by Government set aside order of this Court dated 05.10.1999. It is further submitted that appointment and all promotions of petitioner were recalled as unlawful, therefore, section 22 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Civil Servants Act, 1976, never attracted in the given case. It is urged that earlier matter of petitioner remained under active litigation from 1998 to 2012, up to the Supreme Court and had finally been decided, hence, submitted for dismissal of writ petition in limine.
4.
 The petitioner appeared in person and argued that with regard to reinstatement and retirement a valid order was passed by the Prime Minister of Azad Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir on 26.10.2014, however, same could not be acted upon by respondents for mala fide reasons. He further contended that although he was dismissed from service vide Government notification dated 09.05.1998, against which his writ petition was accepted by this Court through order dated 05.10.1999 and against the aforesaid order, respondents preferred an appeal before the Apex Court which was also dismissed. The petitioner emphasized that since 2010 to 2015, he remained almost unconscious, hence, he is not aware about any judgment of the Apex Court dated 09.10.2012. He finally craved for admission of writ petition, so that direction in the nature of mandamus may be issued against respondents jointly and severally to act upon order of the then Chief Executive dated 26.10.2014, relating to his re-instatement in service along with promotion in BPS-21 since 02.12.1997, followed by notification of retirement on reaching superannuation w.e.f. 27.09.2009.
5
 Mr. Asghar Ali Malik, the learned counsel for respondents, however, submitted that petitioner was dismissed from service on the ground of misconduct, vide Government notification dated 09.05.1998, against which he filed a writ petition before this Court, which was accepted through order dated 05.10.1999, however, Government-respondent and others preferred an appeal against the aforesaid order, which was ultimately accepted by the Apex Court and his writ petition was dismissed, through judgment dated 09.10.2012. He further contended that against the aforesaid judgment, petitioner also filed a Civil Miscellaneous No.429/2014, titled ""
Mujahid Hussain Naqvi v. Azad Government and others
"" which was also dismissed by the Apex Court through order dated 05.12.2015. The learned counsel pressed into service that petitioner concealed the above mentioned judgment and order of the Supreme Court and succeeded to obtain a baseless and concocted order from the Prime Minister dated 26.10.2014, which is not only violative of law but also against the judgment and order of the Apex Court, hence, submitted for dismissal of writ petition in limine.
6.
 We have heard petitioner at some length as well as the learned counsel for respondents, perused the contents of writ petition and examined the appended documents made available with utmost care.
7.
 A contemplate perusal of record reveals that petitioner while holding the post of Secretary to Government BPS-20, was proceeded against as per the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Civil Servants (Efficiency and Discipline) Rules, 1977 and after thorough probe of allegations was found that he had committed misconduct, hence, was reverted grade wise to BPS-20 to BPS-16 as Information Officer and then was dismissed from service through Government notification dated 09.05.1998. Against the aforesaid notification, petitioner instead of filing an appeal in Service Tribunal being civil servant, preferred Writ Petition No.215/ 1998, titled ""
Mujahid Hussain Naqvi v. Azad Government and others
"" before this Court, which was accepted, vide order dated 05.10.1999. Against the aforesaid order Government-respondent and others filed an appeal before the Apex Court, in which difference of opinion arose between two Hon'ble Judges, as a result whereof, matter was placed before the 3rd Judge, who was at the then time, the learned Chief Justice (Mr. Justice Sardar Said Muhammad Khan, as His Lordship then was). The petitioner, however, moved an application that His Lordship should not hear the case for the reasons mentioned in the application, whereupon, the learned Chief Justice declined to hear the case, vide order dated 01.08.2001. The Apex Court, however, finally accepted appeal of respondents vide Judgment dated 09.10.2012, wherein, in paragraphs Nos.13 and 18 of the report, it was observed as under:-
""13.
 We have heard the learned counsel for the appellants, perused the written arguments submitted by respondent No.1 as well as the judgment of the High Court. We propose to take up the argument of the respondents that since he had ceased to be a civil servant, he could not at the relevant time approach the Service Tribunal and the High Court had the jurisdiction to entertain, and decide the writ petition filed by him. After initiating the disciplinary proceedings against the respondent, some administrative orders were also passed by the Government, whereby the respondent was demoted from the post of Secretary to Government as a Director General and ultimately as Information Officer B-16. All orders of demotion have been set aside by the High Court. In the instant appeal, it has been contended by the appellants that the High Court had no jurisdiction to set aside the aforesaid orders of demotion of the respondent because it was the Service Tribunal which had the exclusive jurisdiction to deal with the matter. The orders of demotion of respondent from the post of Secretary to Government to the post of Director General was passed on 26.03.1998, from the post of Director General to the post of Director on 27.03.1998, from the post of Director to the post of Deputy Director on 30.03.1998 and finally from the post of Deputy Director to the post of Information Officer on 1.4.1998. The assertion of the respondent is that when the amendment was carried out on 28.2.1999, a civil servant could file an appeal before the Service Tribunal. The expression 'civil servant' has been defined in section 2 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Civil Servants Act, 1976 which reads as under:---
""2.
 Definitions:- In this Act, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context;
(a)
(b)
 'Civil Servant' means a person or holds a civil post in the service of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, employed in connection with the affairs of the State, but does not include:-
(i)
(ii)
(iii) 
 The final order of reversion of the respondent was passed on 1.4.1998 and he remained in service till 9.5.1998; the date when he was dismissed from service. He filed three appeals before the Service Tribunal to challenge the orders of his reversion. The appeals were pending before the Service Tribunal when he was dismissed from service. However, later on he withdrew the appeals and filed a consolidated writ petition to challenge all the orders, including the order of his dismissal from service. It is clear that cause of action arose to the respondent in respect of his reversion orders on four different dates, i.e., 26.3.1998, 27.3.1998, 30.3.1998 and 1.4.1998. When these causes of action arose his appeals before the Service Tribunal were maintainable and it was only the Service Tribunal which had the jurisdiction to decide whether the reversion orders were validly passed or not. The respondent had filed appeal before the Service Tribunal which was the competent forum. The dismissal of the respondent from service did not have the effect of taking away the jurisdiction from the Service Tribunal to decide the appeals. Therefore, the respondent wrongly withdrew the appeals from the Service Tribunal. According to section 47 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act, 1974, the High Court has no jurisdiction to entertain a dispute over which the Service Tribunal has the exclusive jurisdiction. It was the duty of the High Court to first determine the question of its jurisdiction before passing the impugned judgment. In these circumstances the writ petition filed by orders was not maintainable. Therefore, it can safely be held that the High Court had no jurisdiction to entertain a writ petition in respect of the reversion orders passed against the respondent.
18.
 Now we advert to the crucial question, i.e., whether the High Court has rightly set aside the finding of fact recorded by the Prime Minister being an administrative Authority. It is celebrated principle of law that finding of fact recorded by an administrative Authority performing functions under a statute is sacrosanct. It is also settled now that the High Court, while exercising writ jurisdiction cannot substitute its opinion for the opinion of the administrative Authority. The High Court has held that actually the Prime Minister had ordered the promotion of the respondent to grade B-21 and by implication, there was no forgery. The order of dismissal passed by the Prime Minister on 9.5.1998, after holding that the respondent was guilty of forgery was available before the High Court. In the aforesaid order it was stated that the competent Authority (the Prime Minister) had come to the conclusion in the light of the proceedings taken under notification dated 11.3.1998, that respondent, herein, had tampered with the order passed by the Prime Minister on 02.12.1997. It was also stated in the notification dated 11.3.1998, that the Prime Minister acting as Authority under the E&D Rules, 1977, had directed for initiation of disciplinary proceedings against the respondent on the ground that he had interpolated the order passed by the Prime Minister. After due process, the charge was held to be proved. The finding was recorded by the Prime Minister in his capacity as the Authority under rule 8 of the E&D Rules, 1977. Rule 8 of the E&D Rules, 1977 may advantageously be reproduced below:--

 Action by the Authority,- In the case of any proceedings the record of which has been reported for (sic) or rule 7-A, the authority may pass such orders as it deems fit but before imposing a major penalty, the authority shall afford the accused an opportunity of being heard in person, either before himself or before an officer senior in rank to the accused designated for the purpose after taking into consideration the record of such personal hearing prepared by the officer so designated.
 The assertion of the respondent, the Prime Minister himself allegedly has passed the promotion order of respondent. If it was, so, then there was no question that the Prime Minister could have made a false statement that respondent had been guilty of tampering. The averments made in the written statement filed by the appellants, herein, before the High Court, are fully supported by the record summoned from the Services and General Administration Department but the High Court failed to give any finding on it. The record shows that two orders were passed by the Prime Minister in which he stated that the respondent had interpolated his order dated 2.12.1997. On 20.1.1998, an order was passed by the Prime Minister whereby he ordered that disciplinary action may be taken against the respondent. On 5.3.1998, a similar order was passed by the Prime Minister which is a detailed order in which he has pointed out the exact interpolation and tampering and confirmed the earlier order for initiating disciplinary proceedings against the respondent. Later on when the authorized officer submitted his report to the Prime Minister, the same was accepted and it was ordered that the respondent be dismissed from service for misconduct. The High Court failed to consider these orders properly.
 It may be observed that the order dated 2.12.1997 which according to the respondent, is an un-tampered is itself contradictory and shows that it had been tampered with. For better understanding the position, here we again reproduce the alleged order passed by the Prime Minister. The order reads as under:-
 The perusal of the above order reveals that it has two parts. In its one part, the Prime Minister has directed the Chief Secretary to hear the parties and take further proceedings in the case and in the other part, while accepting the review petition, the Prime Minister has promoted the respondent to grade B-21. In these circumstances the Prime Minister was justified to hold that the order has been tampered with. In presence of the above said material, the observation of the High Court that if the Prime Minister's order had been tampered with, he should have said so rather than withdrawing it, is merely conjectural and it is settled that conjectures cannot take the place of proof. Therefore, we have no hesitation in holding that the High Court has erred in holding that the order passed by the Prime Minister had not been tampered with which finding of the High Court is set aside accordantly.""
 Again in paragraphs Nos.21 and 24 of the report, it was held as follows:-
""21.
 There is still another contention of the respondent that while passing the dismissal order against the respondent, rule 8 of the E&D Rules, 1977 has been violated because fresh notice was not issued by the Authority before passing the said order. A perusal of rule 8, reproduced in the earlier part of this judgment, shows that it does not contain that a fresh notice shall be given to the accused civil servant. However, it provides that the Authority shall afford an opportunity of being heard. As we have observed earlier that in the initial stages all efforts were made for the appearance of the respondent to show cause but on one pretext or the other he failed to appear and show-cause, therefore, it is clear that he was not interested in showing cause. It can safely be held that he had no explanation to give, therefore, there was no occasion for the Authority to provide any opportunity of hearing to the respondent. In our estimation, the opportunity of hearing under rule 8 is only to be provided to a person who has joined the proceedings and has submitted his explanation. It may be stated here that on presentation of the report by the Authorized Officer, the Prime Minister observed that since the accused exhibited non-cooperation with the Authorized Officer by firstly refusing to receive the notice and subsequently by abstaining from filing a written explanation, it was not possible to give him personal hearing.
 Thus, the objection raised by the respondent that no fresh notice was issued to him by the Authority has no force and is hereby repelled.
24.
 Before parting with the judgment, it may be observed that it is a fit case in which the criminal proceedings should be ordered but keeping in view the bad health of the respondent, the dismissal of the writ petition and restoration of the order passed by the Authority will meet the ends of justice.
 In light of what has been discussed above while accepting this appeal and setting aside the judgment of the High Court dated 5.10.1999, the writ petition filed by the respondent is dismissed with no order as to costs.""
8.
 The petitioner concealed the aforesaid judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court dated 09.10.2012, and preferred an application before the Prime Minister who passed the following order:-
9.
 A perusal of application of petitioner reveals that petitioner has deliberately concealed the judgment of the Apex Court dated 09.10.2012, and by suppressing fact succeeded to obtain a void order of his reinstatement and promotion in BPS-21 since 02.12.1997, as well as retirement after attaining age of superannuation w.e.f. 27.09.2009, who has not invoked jurisdiction of this Court with clean hands, therefore, is not entitled to equitable relief of writ jurisdiction. A similar proposition came under consideration before the Apex Court in case titled 
Azad Government and 03 others v. Abdul Ghaffar Butt and 02 others
 [1999 PLC (C.S.) 1203], wherein, at page 1207 of the report it was held as follows:-
""9.
 The contention of the learned counsel for the appellants that even if the allotment in favour of the appellants is void, that should have been challenged by the respondent before the appropriate authority otherwise it cannot be ignored, does not help his case. Because it was the appellants who filed the writ petition in the High Court and it has been repeatedly held by this Court that a person who seeks relief by invoking writ jurisdiction must come with clean hands; if a person bases his claim on a void order, he is not entitled to any relief in exercise of writ jurisdiction.""
The same point came under consideration before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case titled ""
Abid Hussain Jafri and others v. Azad Government and others
"", [1998 PLC (C.S.) 141]. At page 144 of the report, it was opined as follows:-
 "" This is well settled principle of law that a person seeking redress of his grievance by resorting to the writ jurisdiction, must come with clean hands. If it is found that the person seeking relief by way of writ petition has no legal or moral case, then irrespective of the fact that the Chief Secretary or, for that matter, any other departmental authority is bound to obey the orders of the Prime Minister, the High Court may refuse to issue a writ of mandamus in exercise of its discretionary powers vested in it. As the order which was sought to be implemented by the appellants was passed in violation of the principle of 'audi-alteram-partem', the High Court could rightly refuse to issue a writ of mandamus for the implementation of the same irrespective of the fact as to whether the Secretary Works was bound to carry out the same or not. The writ jurisdiction cannot be exercised in perpetuation of an illegal order.""
The similar point was resolved by the Lahore High Court, in case titled 
""Iqtedar Hyder v . Bank of Punjab through its Chairman and another
"", [2001 MLD 1537]. At page 1540 of the report, it was held as follows:-
 ""----It is also settled principle of law that he who seeks equity must come to the Court with clean hands. It is pertinent to mention here that decree was passed against petitioner on 12.09.1998 and petitioner did not agitate the same before this Court by way of appeal nor filed any objection petition before the executing Court. In this view of the matter I am not inclined to exercise my discretion in favour of petitioner"".
10.
 The petitioner, therefore, filed the instant writ petition with unclean hands which is ex-facie frivolous, as well as, contemptuous to frustrate the judgment and order of the Apex Court of the country.
11.
 The contention of petitioner that he remained almost unconscious from 2010 to 2015, seems to be falsified. A perusal of judgment of the Apex Court dated 09.10.2012, makes it abundantly clear that he himself argued his case and pleaded each and every point pertaining to prove his dismissal order as unlawful and each point was authoritatively resolved by the Apex Court of the country. He later on also moved an application for recalling judgment dated 09.10.2012, which too was argued by him. The application was turned down by the Hon'ble Court through order dated 05.12.2015, which proved that his assertion about unconsciousness since 2010 to 2015, is falsified. Even otherwise, the aforesaid point has not been raised by petitioner in memorandum of his writ petition. It is well settled principle of law that a party cannot be allowed to argue its case vis- -vis to pleadings. The aforesaid point was considered by the Apex Court in case titled ""
Azad Government and others v. Qamar-uz-Zaman Khan Niazi
"" (1993 SCR 9). At page 13 of the report, it was held as follows:-
 ""Before going into the merits of case we would like to dispose of this application. The application has been filed under rule 6 of Order IX read with Order XLIII of the Supreme Court Rules and is basically aimed at seeking permission of the Court to file affidavits of the Additional Chief Secretary (General) and the counsel for the appellants. However, a closer look at the contents of the application as well as affidavit shows that practically the appellants are seeking to set up a new case which is entirely inconsistent with the case before the Service Tribunal. As has already been noted, before the Service Tribunal the application which was claimed to have been filed by Qamar-uz-Zaman Niazi containing the conditions of thirty years pension and move-over to grade 19 had been accepted as genuine. In fact it had been clearly stated in the written statement that the Government acted in accordance with law by acceding to the request for retirement as it was authorized by law to pass an order of retirement but did not accept the conditions imposed by Qamar-uz-Zaman Niazi because the same were illegal and could not have been legally accepted. Now before us the Government wants us to hold that the application submitted by Qamar-uz-Zaman Niazi imposing the conditions mentioned above had been returned and another application claimed to have been filed by Qamar-uz-Zarnan Niazi was subsequently processed and in this application Qamar-uz-Zaman Niazi had asked for retirement on completion of 25 years of service. It is well settled that no party can be allowed to set up a case different from a case which had been set up in the pleadings. Apart from that the point at issue is a pure question of fact which can only be decided after taking of fresh evidence. It is equally well settled that a question of fact cannot be raised for the first time in this Court. Without commenting on genuineness or otherwise of the application claimed by the Government to have been filed subsequently by Qamar-uz-Zaman Niazi, we may point out that the copy placed on the record of this Court is a photo copy and is not attested by any officer of the Government. It is only attested by counsel for the appellants. In law a copy can only be issued and certified by a person who has custody of the original document. Admittedly the learned counsel for the appellants is not such a person. Even in the Government file the original, if any, is not available. It cannot, therefore, be positively proved that this application was in fact filed""
The same view was reiterated by the apex Court in case titled ""
Muhammad Hussain v. Abdul Majid and others
"" (1993 SCR 319), wherein at page 321 of the report, it was opined as under:-
 ""It may be stated that this is well settled principle of law that the parties cannot depart from the case as set up in their pleadings and vary the same subsequently at the appellate stage. The parties are bound by their pleadings and even if evidence is led in support of a plea which was not set up in the pleadings, such evidence cannot be looked into. Thus, the High Court has not committed any error in holding that the appellant cannot be permitted to put up altogether a different case from the one which he had set up in the plaint. It may be stated that according to the plaint, each of the share, i.e., 1/3 each, and the mutation was also attested in the year 1958 in accordance to the terms of the decree of the Deputy Custodian. Thus, it does not lie in the mouth of the appellant at the appellate stage to change his stand and argue that he was entitled to more than 1/3 share which he had according to the decree of the Deputy Custodian on the basis of which mutation was also attested.""
The aforesaid view was again highlighted by August Supreme Court in case titled 
""Sheikh Javed Iqbal v. Muhammad Bashir and 5 others""
 (2010 PLC (C.S.) 1264). At page 1268 of the report, it was observed as follows:-
 ""It is celebrated principle of law that no party can travel beyond its pleadings. Respondent No.1 has categorically taken a stand in para 9 of memo. of appeal before the Service Tribunal that no adverse order was communicated to him and he got knowledge of all the orders passed by the departmental authorities on service of order dated 18.09.2009. This factual assertion of the respondent has not been denied by the present appellant and pro forma respondents.""
12.
 The epitome of above discussion is that, finding no substance in the instant writ petition, the same is hereby dismissed in limine with special costs of Rs.50,000/- to be deposited with the ""Nazir"" of this Court, within fortnight period.

 MUHAMMAD YOUNIS THAHEEM, J.---
 The petitioner has invoked the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 with the following relief:
""It is therefore, humbly prayed that on acceptance of this writ petition the order of respondent No.1 dated 27.08.2012 may graciously be set aside and declared the order of respondent No.1 as null, void and of no legal effect.""
2.
 Brief facts of the case are that land situated in Khata No.44 to 48, Mouza Saro Shah District Mardan measuring area 13169 PIUs i.e. 222 acres, 04 Kanals and 13 Marlas was resumed under Land Reforms Regulation No.115 and Land Reforms Act II of 1977 on 04.01.1977 from late Mir Afzal Khan the landlord of the area. After resumption the management of Sarfaraz Khan District Hospital Charity Trust, applied for the grant of lease for the said resumed land which was granted and said land was leased out for 10 years w.e.f. 24.12.1977 vide lease dated 25.03.1980 by the then Deputy Land Commissioner with certain conditions particularly submission of declaration and afterward lease was extended for next 30 years which was to be expired in the year 1987. The Federal Land Commission (hereinafter called as FLC) cancelled the lease vide judgment dated 18.02.1990 and Sarfaraz Khan District Hospital Charity Fund feeling aggrieved filed writ petition which was allowed and case was remanded to respondent No.1 for decision afresh, however against the same remand order, the tenants/respondents No.2 to 102 feeling aggrieved filed Civil Petition before the Honourable Supreme Court but the above said remand order passed by this Court was upheld by the Honourable Supreme Court. The Federal Land Commission vide order dated 28.03.1993 withdrew the notice by holding that Federal Land Commission has got no jurisdiction to revise the order of President of Pakistan, however in the year 2011 Sarfaraz Khan Charity Trust surrendered the same resumed land to the Provincial Land Reforms Commission. Thereafter, the present respondents Nos.2 to 102 filed application for cancellation of lease in favour of Sarfaraz Khan Charity Trust and allotment of same resumed land to them being sitting landless tenants which application was dismissed vide order dated 01.01.2012 by the Deputy Land Reforms Commissioner Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The relevant portion of order is reproduced below:
""I am directed to refer your letter No.104/LR dated 17.12.2011 of the subject noted above and to say that the lease in favour of Mr. Sarfaraz Khan Charity Fund needs to be cancelled by the authority that sanction it. As far as allotment of land to sitting tenants presently there is no scheme of government and should not be done.""
The tenants/respondents Nos.2 to 102 feeling aggrieved from the aforesaid order dated 01.01.2012 challenged same order before the learned Chairman Federal Land Commission/respondent No.1 by filing revision petition i.e. RP.3(30)/FLC/2012 which after hearing was allowed vide order dated 27.08.2012 and respondents No.1/Deputy Land Reforms Commissioner, Mardan was directed to implement the above said order dated 27.08.2012 for distributing/allotting the said resumed land amongst the sitting tenants i.e. respondents Nos.2 to 102. The present petitioners feeling aggrieved from the order dated 27.08.2012 of respondent No.1/Chairman Federal Land Commission, Islamabad filed instant petition on the grounds mentioned therein. During pendency of the instant petition, CM No.291-P/2017 was filed for impleadment of legal heirs of Mir Afzal Khan as party which was allowed vide order dated 17.01.2017.
3.
 Arguments heard. Record perused.
4.
 From the perusal of record it reveals and is admitted position that land in question was resumed under MLR 115 and Land Reforms Act, 1977 by the Federal Land Reforms Commission but instead of distributing the resumed land to the sitting tenants, it was leased out firstly for 10 years to the Sarfaraz Charity Trust which afterward was extended for 30 years onward by the Provincial Land Reforms Commission. The Chairman Federal Land Commission on report of head of the investigation team of FLC took cognizance of the matter of lease of resumed land to the Trust who vide its order/judgment dated 18.02.1990, cancelled the same lease. The said order dated 18.02.1990 was challenged by Sarfaraz Khan Charity Trust by filing writ petition No.140/1990 which was partially allowed as discussed above and tenants/presents respondents Nos.2 to 102 feeling aggrieved from the judgment of this Court dated 23.02.1992, filed Civil Petition No.51-P/1992 before the Hon'ble Apex Court who vide order/judgment maintained the order/judgment of this Court dated 30.02.1992. Lastly, the Senior Member FLC vide order dated 28.03.1993 vacated the notice issued to the Trust and filed the case. In the meanwhile in the year 2011 the said Sarfaraz Khan Hospital Charity Trust surrendered the same resumed land to the Provincial Land Reforms Commission, upon which the sitting tenants/respondents Nos.2 to 102 moved application for cancellation of lease to the Trust and allotment of the same land to them i.e. respondents Nos.2 to 102 which application was turned down despite No Objection Certificate by the Trust vide order dated 01.01.2012, passed by Deputy Land Commissioner, so the same order was challenged by the present respondents Nos.2 to 102 by filing Revision Petition i.e. RP.3(530)/FLC/2012 which petition after hearing was allowed. The relevant Paragraph of the order, passed by the learned Chairman Federal Land Commission, Islamabad is reproduced as below:
""In view of the foregoing arguments of the learned counsel for the petitioners, position available on file relating to the claim of the petitioners and considering the possession of the sitting tenants along with provisions of paragraph 18 of the Land Reforms Regulations, 1972 I hereby accept the instant petition and allot the land mentioned in the respective khata numbers available in the revenue record, which provide the names of tenants before this Court. This allotment is made under the provisions of paragraph 18(3) of MLR-115/72 according to the possession of the tenants. The stance taken in the para-wise comments by the Provincial Land Reforms Authorities is not legal and against the norms of justice and is also without jurisdiction. The stand taken in the said comments is also against the preamble of the Land Reforms Regulation, 1972 and the Land Reforms Act, 1977, as it purely favours the rights of tenants and the supreme cause given in the preamble relates to the uplift of peasantry i.e. the tenant class. Hence, the directions issued by the Respondents Nos.1, 2 and 3 are set aside as being without lawful authority and of no legal effect. Deputy Land Commissioner, Mardan/Revenue Staff of the concerned halqa are directed to implement this order of allotment in the revenue record in favour of the petitioners, which have been mentioned in the petition, and is attached with this order. However, land allotted to the tenants shall not exceed 100 kanals or 12-1/2 acres as given in the Regulations/Act DLC, Mardan is further directed to submit compliance report of this order to the Register, FLC within a fortnight on its official receipt.""
5.
 Here it is pertinent to mention that the office of Advocate General Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar was consulted by the SMBR for legal opinion in view of judgment passed in Revision Petition RP.3 (530)/FLC/2012. The office of Advocate General put forward his opinion which is reproduced as below:
 After resumption of land despite distributing it to the peasantry it was delivered to the same land owner in the name of charitable trust which offended the very cause of Land Reforms and now since the Charity Trust has surrendered it and have got no objection, so if the same land is allotted to the sitting tenants, therefore, he opined that:
""I do not see any reason why the same shall not be given to the peasants within the terms of the law on the subject.""
6.
 Though the previous lease holder i.e. said Charity Trust has no concern with the resumed land even then the management of said Trust submitted No Objection Certificate (NOC) signed by the Admn: Manager Premier Sugar Mills Retired Major Shoukat Ali Khan dated 13.09.2011 that the Charity Trust has got no objection if the same resumed land is allotted to the sitting tenants. The revenue record annexed with the writ petition also supports that respondents Nos.2 to 102 are sitting tenants of the land at the time of resumption and during lease period of said Trust, so the respondents Nos.2 to 102 are coming tenants of the resumed land since their forefathers.
7.
 Thus after examining the record and the case law on the subject, this Court is of the view that first of all the petitioners have no locus standi and cause of action to file the instant petition to challenge the order, passed by Chairman FLC which is superior forum in the hierarchy of Federal Land Reforms Commission. Secondly, the land was basically resumed from original land owners for its aim and purpose of distribution/allotment to the sitting tenants and not to government officers whether Federal or Provincial or lease it out to someone else instead of tenant under the Land Reforms Laws in any garb, however after the judgment passed in Qazalbash's case cited as PLD 1990 SC 99, vide which fresh resumption of land for the purpose of Land Reforms was declared against the injunctions of Islam but it was not held in said judgment that resumed land for the purpose and aim to distribute it to the landless tenants will not be distributed or allotted to the sitting landless tenants and has not given any direction that instead of allotting resumed land to the landless tenants, it be allotted to officers or employees of Federal as well as Provincial Government employees or to lease it out or to utilize it against the aim and object of the Land Reforms Laws rather resumption made from 1972 under MLR 115 and ibid Act, 1977 was saved. In the instant case it has been noticed that instead of distributing the same resumed land to the sitting tenants, it was leased out to the original owner in the name of Trust who in turn received millions of rupees from the old sitting tenants. So the order dated 27.08.2012 impugned herein passed by Chairman FLC is in accordance with Land Reforms Laws and is not against the injunctions of Islam.
8.
 This Court found no any illegality in it rather the same order dated 27.08.2012 is a step for the accomplishment of object and purpose of Land Reforms Program for which land in excess of determined ceiling was resumed to distribute it to the sitting landless tenants, so in the instant case tenants/respondents Nos.2 to 102 were entitled for allotment since the resumption of land under Land Reforms Regulation and ibid Act, 1977, hence their right for allotment subsisted by the operation of law as the laws are still in field, it requires no any scheme by the Provincial government for the distribution of resumed land, therefore, the Chairman FLC had correctly set aside the order passed by Deputy Land Commissioner, Mardan dated 01.01.2012. Moreover, the land resumed has not been freshly resumed from the original land owner but it was resumed only with aim, object and purpose to allot/donate the same to the sitting landless tenants for same purpose Land Reforms Commission was constituted and due to inaction of Federal Land Reforms Commission from the date of resumption by not allotting resumed land to sitting tenants shall not be affected adversely, so the cut date in Qazalbash's case dated 23.03.1990 does not create any hurdle for allotment of resumed land to the landless sitting tenants according to Land Reforms Laws, Rules and Regulations.
9.
 Moreso, resumption of land under Land Reforms Laws has been saved in the judgment of Qazalbash's case, so the original land owners though after resumption has no concern whatsoever with the resumed land even then in the instant case he/they have got no objection as discussed above if the same resumed land is distributed amongst sitting tenants i.e. respondents Nos.2 to 102. This Court is of the view that if the said resumed land is utilized other than the purpose ordained in the Land Reforms Laws, then it would be great injustice to the sitting tenants and would amount making Land Reforms Laws as effectless on one pretext or the other. Moreover, the Land Reforms Laws are still in field and the Parliament of Pakistan has not repealed these laws, so are effective from the date of their commencement. It is further observed that different land Mafias including the officers of Federal as well as of Provincial government employees are behind such resumed and other government lands to grab it which is very unfortunate, so the concerned Land Reforms Commission's officers must take notice of it and distribute the resumed land in K.P.K to the sitting tenants as they are holding their offices for the accomplishment and fulfillment of very purpose and object of Land Reforms Program as huge amount in form of salaries is paid to the employees of the commission.
10.
 Thus what has been discussed above, we are of the view that this petition being bereft of merits, is dismissed.

 MOHAMMAD IBRAHIM KHAN, J.--
By this writ petition Shafiullah the Petitioner herein, has set in the following prayer:-
""In the light of the above and many other grounds to be advanced at the time of hearing with the prior permission of this Hon'ble Court, it is therefore, humbly prayed that consequent upon, the acceptance of this writ petition, the impugned order of lower Appellate Court (Respondent No. 7) dated 06.06.2013 may kindly be declared illegal, unlawful, unconstitutional, against law and natural justice, and the Respondents Nos. I and 2 may kindly be held responsible for the payment of decretal amount which is outstanding against the original judgment debtor, as they stood surety for the payment during the pendency of the original suit by filing affidavit in this regard, and the Respondent No.8 be directed to proceed against the Respondents Nos. 1 and 2 according to law.
Any other remedy coupled with cost, which is efficacious and appropriate, in peculiar circumstances of the case, may please be graciously granted though not specifically prayed for.""
2.
 In essence the grievance of the Petitioner is that he had filed a suit for declaration cum permanent injunction against the predecessor-in-interest of the Respondents Nos. 3 to 6 and Manager Habib Bank Chakisar Branch on account of being owner of the house bearing Khasra No. 1928 situated within the local limits of Mauza Chakisar. The said house was crumbled down in the earthquake occurred in the year 2005 and predecessor-in-interest of the Respondents Nos. 3 to 6 was tenant-at-will in the said house, so, he has no right to construct the same or receive compensation in lieu of it from the government exchequer, which has been issued to the earthquake affectees in the year 2006. During the pendency of this Civil Suit No. 23/1, the Petitioner moved an application for obtaining temporary injunction, which was dismissed by the learned Trial Court on 17.07.2007 mainly on the pretext that learned counsel for the Defendant/Respondents Nos. 1 and 2 furnished an affidavit that they will pay double amount in case of decree in favour of the Petitioner (hereinbefore called as Plaintiff).
3.
 After grant of decree in favour of Petitioner (hereinbefore called as Plaintiff), an appeal was preferred bearing No. 144/13 of the year 2010 on behalf of the Respondents Nos. 1 and 2, which was also answered in negative vide the order dated 13.10.2011 by the learned District Judge/Zila Qazi Shangla and being not assailed further the said order has attained finality. For satisfaction of the decree, the Petitioner (hereinbefore called as Plaintiff/decree-holder) filed execution petition before the learned Executing Court i.e. Respondent No. 8 by adding names of the Respondents Nos. 1 and 2 in the column of judgment debtors. The other part filed cross-objection petition bearing No. 1/11 of the year 2012 before the learned Executing Court, which was left undecided as learned appellate Court suspended the execution proceedings in wake of the pendency of civil revision bearing No. 19/5 of 2012. In the meanwhile, the Respondents Nos. 1 and 2 submitted revision petition for deletion of their names from the panel of judgment debtors in the execution proceedings, which was allowed vide the impugned order dated 06.06.2013, resultantly names of the Respondents Nos. 1 and 2 were deleted from the list of judgment debtors. Having no other alternate remedy the Petitioner/decree-holder approached this Court through the writ petition in hand inter alia on the grounds mentioned therein.
4.
 Having heard arguments of learned counsel for the Petitioner, while despite hectic efforts service of the Respondents could not be procured, hence most of them have been placed ex parte.
5.
 The impugned order dated 06.06.2016 is gone through, it reveals that the Petitioners, who were herein the Respondents, were not arrayed party in the original suit bearing No. 23/1 decided by the learned Civil Court, therefore no decree was passed against each of the judgment debtor in the execution proceedings. Hence, the petition was accepted and names of the Petitioners herein now the Respondents/judgment debtors in the execution proceedings of the decree dated 24.5.2010 were deleted from file No. 2/10 of 2012 pending adjudication before the learned Executing Court, Chakisar.
6.
 Hence the impugned order in view of the provisions of section 145 (1) of the Civil Procedure Code has not been passed in accordance with law, which reads as under:-
145. 
Enforcement of liability of surety
.- Where any person has become liable as surety--
 (a) for the performance of any decree or any part thereof, or
 (b) for the restitution of any property taken in execution of a decree, or
(c) for payment of any money, or for the fulfillment of any condition imposed on any person, under an order of the Court in any suit or in any proceedings consequent thereon,
the decree or order may be executed against him, to the extent to which he has rendered himself personally liable, in the manner herein provided for the execution of decrees, and such person shall, for the purpose of appeal, be deemed a party within the meaning of Section 47.
Provided that such notice as the Court in each case thinks sufficient has been given to the surety.
7.
 During pendency of the execution proceedings an objection petition was filed before the learned executing Court, wherein it was specifically mentioned therein in Para V in respect of taking over of the responsibility by sureties/guarantors for payment of an amount released from the government exchequer for renovation of the house damaged during the earthquake which was withdrawn from Habib Bank Chakisar Branch. It has also been held in 2002 CLC 451 ""Habib Bank Limited v. Malik Ata Muhammad and 4 others"". The relevant citations (a) & (e) are reproduced as under:-
 (a) Civil Procedure Code (V of 1908)
Ss. 47 & 145. Execution of decree. Liability of surety. Surety not arrayed as party to suit or appeal. Execution of decree against such surety. Validity. Decree passed against a judgment-debtor could also be executed against such surety, which was not even arrayed as a party to suit or appeal. Liability of the surety was co-extensive with the judgment-debtor and continued till such tune that the decree was either satisfied by the judgment-debtor or by the surety.
 (e) Civil Procedure Code (V of 1908)
Ss. 147 & 96. Liability of surety. Scope. Appeal was continuation of suit. If appeal was accepted, the liability of the surety was revived. Such revived liability could be enforced against the surety.
8.
 Under the Contract Act, 1872 that even a guarantor can only be burdened to the extent and in accordance with the terms of the guarantee executed by him. In this respect, reliance has been placed on 2002 CLD 509 ""Mst. Parveen Amir v. National Bank of Pakistan and 3 others"". The relevant citation (b) is reproduced as under:--
 (b) Contract Act (IX of 1872)
...Ss. 126 & 128. Liability of guarantor. Extent. Guarantor could only be burdened to the extent and in accordance with the terms of guarantee executed by him.""
 The liability of the guarantor being co-extensive with judgment debtor and surety is liable by all means to fulfill his commitment in respect of the payment with regard to which he has taken the responsibility for its payment. The learned Executing Court can lawfully proceed against the sureties for the recovery of the amount to the extent of decree, thus, the names of the Respondents Nos. 1 and 2 were unlawfully deleted from the panel of judgment debtors in the execution proceedings by acceptance of the revision petition by the learned District Judge/Zila Qazi Shangla through the impugned order, which stands set aside, the sureties cannot be exempted from the liability of the payment in such hasty manner in violation of the provision of Section 145(1) of the Civil Procedure Code.
9.
 It is as learnt that out of the Respondents, Saifullah Khan, Respondent No. 1 has died, so his Legal Heirs are liable to pay the decretal amount in equal share, while the Respondent No. 2 Zahid Ali has been placed ex parte as he was only interested to defend his rights in this writ petition.
10.
 Copy of this judgment be placed before the learned Executing Court for the recovery of decretal amount from guarantors/ sureties, exclusively who shall be summoned before the learned executing Court.
11.
 In such terms this writ petition is accepted accordingly.

 AAMER FAROOQ J.---
 The petitioner filed a Suit for Declaration and Permanent Injunction challenging the price fixed by the respondents at the time of registration of the Drug 'Sofvasc-HCT Tablets' manufactured by the petitioner on the ground that the respondents not have the authority to do so and the price fixed was discriminatory, illegal and inconsistent with the provisions of Drugs Act, 1976 and Drugs Regulatory Authority of Pakistan Act, 2012. Along with the Suit, an application for interim relief was filed under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. The respondents filed reply to the referred application. The said application for interim relief was dismissed vide order dated 07.11.2016 on the ground that jurisdiction of the Civil Court is barred. The petitioner assailed the order before District Judge, Islamabad by way of an appeal which was dismissed vide order dated 11.02.2017.
2.
 Learned counsel for the petitioner, inter alia, contended that the courts have interpreted the provision regarding the bar of jurisdiction strictly and do exercise jurisdiction. It was further contended that the Civil Court do have the jurisdiction in such like cases and in the instant the Court had the jurisdiction inasmuch as the issue of price fixation does not fall within the domain of the Authority and it has exercised the same illegally, which can be examined by the Court of plenary jurisdiction. Reliance was placed on cases reported as 'Mian Muhammad Latif v. Province of West Pakistan through the Deputy Commissioner, Khairpur and another' (PLD 1970 Supreme Court 180), `Hamid Husain v. Government of West Pakistan and others (1974 SCMR 356), 'Province of the Punjab through Collector District Khushab, Jauharabad and others v. Haji Yaqoob Khan and others' (2007 SCMR 554), `Begum Syeda Azra Masood v. Begum Noshaba Moeen and others' (2007 SCMR 914), 'M/s Getz Pharma (Pvt.) Ltd. through Authorized Person v. Province of Sindh through Chief Secretary, Government of Sindh and 7 others' (PLD 2016 Sindh 479), `Liaqat National Hospital Association through Chairman, Governing Body and another v. Province of Sindh through Chief Secretary and 5 others' (PLD 2002 Karachi 359) and `Shahida Bibi and others v. Habib Bank Limited and others' (PLD 2016 Supreme Court 995).
3.
 Learned counsel for the respondents, inter alia, contended that jurisdiction of the Civil Courts is barred under section 39 of the Drug Act, 1976 therefore the orders passed by the courts below are in accordance with law.
4.
 The petitioner filed a Suit for Declaration and Permanent Injunction which was resisted by the respondents on the ground that same is barred under section 39 of the Drugs Act, 1976. For the ease of convenience, relevant provision of law is reproduced below:--
""39.
 
Finality of orders, etc.--
 Save as otherwise expressly provided in this Act, every order passed or decision given by any Board, a Drug Court or any other authority under this Act shall be final and shall not be called in question by or before any Court or other authority.""
The bare reading of above Section shows that any order passed or decision given by any Board is final and not to be called in question by or before any court or other authority.
5.
 The Courts of Pakistan have interpreted such provisions strictly in a way not to oust the jurisdiction of the courts. In a case reported as 'Mian Muhammad Latif v. Province of West Pakistan through the Deputy Commissioner, Khairpur and another' (PLD 1970 Supreme Court 180), it was observed as follows:-
""There is no doubt that under section 11 of the Sindh Revenue Jurisdiction Act, 1876, ordinarily a party in revenue matters should exhaust all his remedies by way of appeal before invoking the aid of the civil Court. But there are different considerations where the allegation of a party is that the impugned order is a nullity in the eye of law. The civil courts have jurisdiction to examine into cases where statutory provisions have not been complied with or the statutory tribunal has not acted in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial procedure""
Similarly, in case reported as `Hamid Husain v. Government of West Pakistan and others' (1974 SCMR 356), it was observed as follows:-
""Jurisdiction of civil Courts even if bared and conferred upon special tribunals, civil courts being Courts of ultimate jurisdiction have jurisdiction to examine acts of such forums to see if such are in accordance with law, or illegal, or even mala fide.""
In a case reported as 'Province of the Punjab through Collector District Khushab, Jauharabad and others v. Haji Yaqoob Khan and others' (2007 SCMR 554). it was held as under:-
""It is pertinent to mention here that different statutes provide that an order made by the authority acting under it shall not be called in question in any Court. The intentions of the Legislature in their wisdom qua section 36 of Colonization of Government Lands (Punjab) Act, 1912 are that the officers working under the Act should exercise their powers freely and should not be interrupted unnecessarily to administer colony land according to the terms and conditions issued by the competent authority off and on but this provision does not give unfettered power. The ambit of jurisdiction has been prescribed by the Act and the officers functioning there under cannot be allowed to act beyond their scope of jurisdiction. The Civil Court while exercising supervisory jurisdiction has the authority to interfere, if the orders are without jurisdiction, mala fide, excessive or otherwise not in accordance with law or based on fraud. This proposition of law was considered by the Privy Council in Secretary of State v. Mask and Company AIR 1940 PC 105 and laid down the following principles:---
""The exclusion of jurisdiction of the Civil Courts is not to be readily inferred but that such exclusion must either be explicitly expressed or clearly implied. It is also well-settled that even if jurisdiction is so excluded, the Civil Courts have jurisdiction to examine into cases where the provisions of the Act have not been complied, or the statutory Tribunal has not acted in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial procedure.""
The aforesaid proposition of law was considered by this Court in Zafarul Ahsan's case (supra) and laid down following principles:---
""Of course where the proceedings are taken mala fide and the statute is used merely as a cloak to cover an act which in fact is not taken though it purports to have been taken under the statute, the order will not, in accordance with a long line of decisions in England and in this sub-continent, be treated as an order under the statute.""
There are several pronouncements of the superior Courts that Civil Court in spite of the exclusive power has jurisdiction to take the cognizance of the matter in case the authorities under the Special Law have passed the order in violation of Rules and Regulations or mala fide. It is also settled law that manner of exercising power is also termed as mala fide as law laid down by this Court in Agha Shorash Kashmiri's case PLD 1969 SC 14. The aforesaid proposition of law with regard to the jurisdiction of the Civil Court is supported by following judgments:--
(1) Khadim Hussain's case PLD 1967 Lah. 915, (2) Muhammad Amin's case 1998 MLD 413, (3) Jewana's case PLD 1954 Lah. 253, (4) Karam Dad's case PLD 1978 Lah. 679, (5) Muhammad Saleh's case 1980 CLC 662, (6) Muhammad Ibrahim's case PLD 1960 Lah. 1106, (7) Masood Ali's case PLD 1950 Lah. 340, (8) Anjuman-e-Taleem-ul-Islam's case PLD 1983 Lah. 294, (9) Hamayun's case 1997 MLD 2669, (10) Muhammad Akram's case PLD 1993 Lah. 114, (11) Nawab Din's case 2003 CLC 1922, (12) Fateh Muhammad's case 2002 CLC 639, (13) Muhammad Zafar's case 2003 CLC 1922, (14) Muhammad Saleh's case 1980 CLC 662 (15); Khadim Hussain's case 1970 SCMR 127 and (16) Muhammad Shafi's case 1982 CLC 55.
The ratio of the aforesaid judgments is that section 36 of the Colonization of Government Lands (Punjab) Act, 1912 is available only where the authorities concerned acted within powers and four corners of their jurisdiction and not their acts are ultra vires or without jurisdiction or void or in excess of their jurisdiction""
In a case reported as 'Begum Syeda Azra Masood v. Begum Noshaba Moeen and others' (2007 SCMR 914), the august Apex Court reiterated the earlier case law and observed as follows:
""The law is clearly settled that an ouster clause in any statute will only apply when the authorities constituted therein act within the four corners of the statute and if they step out of it, the protection available to the orders passed by a Tribunal of special jurisdiction is no more available and Court of plenary jurisdiction could examine the controversy""
The Hon'ble Sindh High Court also followed the referred principle in a case reported as ""M/s Getz Pharma (Pvt.) Ltd. through Authorized Person v. Province of Sindh through Chief Secretary, Government of Sindh and 7 others' (PLD 2016 Sindh 479).
6.
 In view of above case law, the ousting of jurisdiction as provided in Section 39 of Drug Act, 1976 shall operate only if the Board or Drug Courts have acted in accordance with four corners of law. In case, there is any illegality or jurisdictional defect in exercise of authority, the same can be examined by civil courts being the court of plenary jurisdiction and the ouster clause would not be an impediment in exercise of jurisdiction by the civil courts.
7.
 There is no cavil that under section 56(d) of Specific Relief Act, 1877, no injunction can be granted against exercise of authority by a public functionary. However, if the public functionary acts illegally or mala fide, the referred exclusion shall not be applicable. Reliance is placed on a case reported as Liaqat National Hospital Association through Chairman, Governing Body and another v. Province of Sindh through Chief Secretary and 5-others' (PLD 2002 Karachi 359).
8.
 The learned trial court as well as first appellate court, while dismissing the application and the appeal, have erred in holding that the civil courts do not have the jurisdiction in light of Section 39 of the Drugs Act, 1976. The conclusion reached by the courts below is without examining the fact that whether the respondents have exercised their authority in accordance with law or have acted with mala fide. The jurisdiction, hence exercised by the courts below, is with material irregularity hence the impugned orders are not tenable.
9.
 In view of above, instant Civil Revision is allowed and the orders dated 11.02.2017 and 07.11.2016 are set aside. Consequently, the application for interim relief, filed by the petitioner, shall be deemed to be pending before learned trial court and shall be decided on merits in accordance with law.

49,"JAN MUHAMMAD Versus CUSTODIAN EVACUEE PROPERTY, AZAD JAMMU AND KASHMIR, MUZAFFARABAD","June 8, 2017",HIGH COURT AZAD KASHMIR, Honorable Justice Mohammad Sheraz Kiani ,2018 YLRN 24,"JUDGMENT
 
 MOHAMMAD SHERAZ KIANI, J.--
The captioned writ petition has been filed under section 44 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act, 1974 whereby the petitioners have implored the following relief:--
""It is therefore humbly prayed that the writ petition may kindly be accepted and appropriate writ in favour of petitioner against the respondents may kindly be issued whereby, the order passed by the respondent No.1 dated 30.07.2013 may kindly be set aside. Consequently, the earlier orders passed by respondent No.1 dated 15.03.2013 and 10.08.2011 may also be quashed and the allotment of land bearing khasra Nos.414, 417, 420, 128 measuring 23 kanals 2 marlas situated at village Serri Tehsil and District Muzaffarabad may kindly be restored. Any other relief for which the petitioner be deemed entitled may also be granted in the interest of justice.""
2.
 The precise facts, leading to filing of the instant writ petition are that petitioner, being refugee of 1947 and entitled to 64 kanals land, the land was allotted in village Samahni and Malote tehsil and District Mirpur, as per his entitlement, however the land situated in village Malote Tehsil and District Mirpur, measuring 24 kanals 16 marlas was cancelled from the name of the petitioner, herein, on his request vide order dated 10.08.2011 on the ground that the same was barren and un-cultivable, with the condition that the petitioner will not be entitled to further allotment. It has been stated that thereafter, the petitioner according to his scale, got allotment chit dated 16.11.2011 pertaining to land bearing survey Nos.414, 417, 40, 128 situated in village Serri Tehsil and District Muzaffarabad after due process of law. It has been claimed that the petitioner applied for PRTO, however, the learned Custodian, vide order dated 15.03.2013 cancelled the allotment of the petitioner. The petitioner challenged the above order through a review petition before the Custodian which has also been dismissed through impugned judgment dated 30.07.2013, hence, the above titled writ petition before this Court.
3.
 The respondents were directed to file comments and later on, written statement but they did not appear before the Court, therefore, were proceeded ex-parte vide order dated 24.01.2014, however, upon the application of the respondents vide order dated 11.11.2015, the ex-parte order was recalled by this Court but respondents could not succeed to file written statement.
4.
 Mr. Muhammad Yaqoob Khan Mughal, Advocate the learned counsel for the petitioner, inter-alia, reiterated the facts incorporated in the petition and contended that the petitioner is refugee of 1947, hence, was entitled to the land as per the scale, up to 64 kanals and the same was allotted in his favour, however, the land measuring 24 kanals 16 marlas, situated in village Malote Tehsil and District Mirpur, being barren and unapproachable, was cancelled from the name of the petitioner, on his request vide order dated 10.08.2011 and the petitioner, being entitled to the Evacuee land as per scale, obtained allotment chit for another land bearing survey Nos.414, 417, 40, 128 situated in village Serri Tehsil and District Muzaffarabad on 16.11.2016 and made an application before the Custodian for Proprietary Rights Transfer Order, however, the learned Custodian, vide judgment dated 15.03.2013 cancelled the allotment chit, issued in favour of the petitioner on 16.11.2011. The learned counsel contended that the said judgment is a nullity in the eye of law on the ground that the case of the petitioner does not fall within the definition of the conditions, laid down in Section 18(B) of the Administration of Evacuee Property Act, which empowers the Custodian for cancellation of the allotment. The learned counsel stressed the point that the petitioner, being a refugee of 1947 is entitled to 64 kanals land and he has never abandoned his right of allotment, as has been observed by the learned Custodian and the application of the petitioner does not contain any such condition, however, in the statement the same has been incorporated, inadvertently by the officials of the Custodian, which the petitioner cannot be penalized for.
5. Mr. Muhammad Ilyas Abbasi, Advocate, the learned counsel for the petitioner, adopted the arguments of Mr. Muhammad Yaqoob Khan Mughal and added that the conditions, which have been enumerated in section 18(B) of the Administration of Evacuee Property Act, 1957 cannot be imposed upon the case of the petitioner and the learned Custodian has travelled beyond his jurisdiction, while passing the impugned order, he could have refused to grant the PRTO but cancellation of the allotment was not within his powers, therefore by accepting the instant writ petition, the judgment passed in review petition dated 30.07.2013 and the orders dated 15.03.2013 and 10.08.2011 be quashed and the petitioner be declared entitled to the evacuee land as per the prescribed scale.
6. On the contrary, the learned legal Advisor, appearing on behalf of the respondents, controverted the stance of the petitioner and contended that the petitioner was allotted land in District Mirpur in 1998 and the petitioner remained slept over his own cause for a period of about 13 years and thereafter, when, a valuable land was traced by him, he got cancelled the already allotted land just to take monetary benefits . The learned counsel claimed that the petitioner is estopped from filing the instant writ petition, due to his conduct . The learned counsel stressed the point that the order dated 15.03.2013 has been passed on the basis of order dated 10.08.2011 and the said order has not been challenged by the petitioner, before any proper forum, hence, has attained finality, whereas, the order dated 15.03.2013 has been passed in compliance of the said order, therefore, when the basic order has attained finality, the process in furtherance, thereof, cannot be termed as illegal. The learned counsel submitted that the order dated 10.08.2011 was passed on the request and statement of the petitioner, wherein, he has abandoned his right of further allotment, however, the petitioner, with the connivance of the concerned staff, managed to obtain allotment chit of the land situated in village Serri Tehsil and District Muzaffarabad,. however, when the matter of PRTO came before the learned Custodian, the Custodian, after due inquiry into the matter cancelled the allotment chit, issued in favour of the petitioner, under section 18(B) of the Administration of Evacuee Property Act, 1957. No illegality or irregularity has been committed by the respondents and the instant writ petition has been filed by the petitioner in order to protect the ill-gotten gains and the petitioner does not deserve any relief from this Court.
7.
 I have heard the learned counsel for the parties, gone through the record and given due thought to the controversy involved, therein.
8.
 At the very outset of the case, this Court would like to observe that the Custodian is a special tribunal of exclusive jurisdiction, findings of which cannot be nullified in exercise of writ jurisdiction, until and unless some glare departure from any settled law or its violation is established or the same is passed without jurisdiction , whereas, no such violation of law has been pointed out by the petitioners in the case in hand.
9.
 A perusal of the file reveals that except the judgment dated 30.07.02013, the other documents are unattested Photostat copies, hence, the instant writ petition has not been filed, by fulfilling the requirement of rule 32(2) of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir High Court Procedure Rules, 1984. For convenience, relevant rule is reproduced, which reads as follows:--
""32(1)
 An application under Section 44 of the Constitution for a direction, order or writ in the nature of mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, quo warranto etc, other than a writ in the nature of habeas corpus shall be filed before the Deputy Registrar.
(2) The application shall set out the name and description of the applicant, the exact nature of the relief sought and the ground on which it is sought, and shall be accompanied by an affidavit verifying the facts relied on, a certified copy of the impugned order and at least two copies thereof including annexure if any in addition to separate copy for each one of the respondents. The annexure accompanying the petition shall be marked numerically in red ink by the petitioner and the petition shall be properly indexed"".
10. However, in order to avoid technicalities and give decision on merits, I have perused the file with due care and found that the main stress of the petitioner is that the Custodian was not competent to cancel his allotment because the case of the petitioner does not come within the purview of the conditions laid down in section 18(B) of the Administration of Evacuee Property Act, 1957. To elaborate the legal position, relevant provision of law is reproduced, as under:--
""18(B) 1
. Notwithstanding anything contained contrary in any other law, for the time being in force, and without prejudice to the generality of the powers which already vest in him, the Custodian may cancel any allotment of evacuee property in the following cases:-
(a) Where an allottee has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of allotment within the meaning of Section 18 of the Act,
(b) Where an allottee has; to the satisfaction of the Custodian, voluntarily surrendered or abandoned the allotment;
(c) Where the allotment has been made in violation of law or is without jurisdiction;
(d) Where the evacuee property stands allotted to more than one person and it is necessary to determine the entitlement to allotment;
(e) Where an allotment is in excess of the prescribed scale and it is necessary to bring the allotment within scale in order to confer proprietary rights in accordance with law, upon such allottee. The Custodian shall exercise the powers of Multiple Judge under the Multiple Allotment Act, 1961, in cases processed or being processed for the grant of proprietary rights.
11. As the petitioner had abandoned his right of allotment, while recording his statement, during the proceedings of cancellation of the earlier allotment and the order dated 10.08.2011 was not challenged by the petitioner , well in time and he remained slept over his own case for a pretty long period and contrary to the said order, he managed to obtain further allotment and also applied for PRTO, however, on inquiry the learned Custodian took cognizance of the matter and cancelled his allotment, declaring the same as illegal and derogatory to the order dated 10.08.2011 , relevant content of the order is reproduced, hereunder:
12.
 The above order is still intact, which categorically forbids any further allotment to the petitioner. Previously, according to the prescribed scale, the land measuring 64 kanals was allotted in favour of the petitioner and thereafter, with his own free consent and willingness he got cancelled the allotment of the land to the extent of 24 kanals 16 marlas. He recorded his statement before the Custodian on 10.08.2011 and stated that in lieu of the cancelled land, no other allotment shall be made in his favour and the order of the Custodian dated 10.08.2011 clearly speaks that the petitioner will not be entitled to any further allotment. In presence of that order, the subsequent allotment from khasra Nos. 414, 417, 420, 128 measuring 23 kanals 2 marlas situated at village Serri Tehsil and District Muzaffarabad, in his name was contrary to the order dated 10.08.2011 and the same was allotted without lawful authority. In such situation, section 18(B)1(c) of the Act confers vast powers upon the Custodian, where the allotment is made in violation of any law or without jurisdiction, the Custodian is quite competent to cancel the same, so, the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the impugned order has been passed without jurisdiction is misconceived.
13. It has also been noticed that the petitioner got allotment of land situated in village Malote Tehsil and District Mirpur in 1998 and kept mum for a period of more than 13 years and when he succeeded to trace out some more valuable piece of land, he opted to get cancelled the said land and also succeeded to obtain allotment of another piece of land, apparently out of sheer greed. If the previous allotted land was not useful, why he did not refuse or got it cancelled that time, immediately. If such practice is allowed, then every allottee would like to get costly lands by adopting such methods for commercial reasons, which is not the intent and object of law. The story of allotment reveals that the petitioner has not come with clean hands rather seeks the protection of ill-gotten gains, that too, contrary to a Court order, in such circumstances, the writ cannot be issued in his favour.
14.
 A scrutiny of the file also reveals that the petitioner, though has prayed for vacation of order dated 10.08.2011 in the prayer clause of the petition, however, has not appended the said order with the petition.
15.
 As far the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner never abandoned his right of allotment and there is no mention of the same in the application filed on behalf of the petitioner is concerned, in this regard, it may be observed that the petitioner, has not appended the application, relied upon by him with the petition and has also not challenged the order dated 10.08.2011, properly. As the presumption of correctness is attached with the official/ judicial orders in absence of any proof, his assertion cannot be believed, therefore, it cannot be said that he had not abandoned his right of allotment, especially, when the order dated 10.08.2011 has attained finality.
16.
 For my own satisfaction, I have gone through the judgment under challenge, critically and have found that the same is based on sound reason, comprehensive enough one and a self speaking judgment, which a judicial order should be, and no illegality or departure from any law has been found, therefore, I am of the considered view that the judgment under challenge does not warrant any interference by this Court.
17.
 The sequel of the above discussion is that the instant writ petition being without any substance, is hereby dismissed.
ZC/26/HC(AJK)
 Petition dismissed."
